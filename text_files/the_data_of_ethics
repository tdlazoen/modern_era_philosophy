PREFACE. 



A EBiniiEBNCB to the programme of the "System of 
Synthetic Philosophy/' will show that the chapters herewith 
issued^ constitute the first division of the work on th^ 
Prvruylples of Morality, with which the System ends. As 
the second and third volumes of the Prmciphs of Sociology 
are as yet unpublished^ this instalment of the succeeding 
work appears out of its place. 

I have been led thus to deviate from the order originally 
set down, by the fear that persistence in conforming to it 
might result in leaving the final work of the series 
unexecuted. Hints, repeated of late years with increasing 
frequency and distinctness, have shown me that health may 
permanently fail, even if life does not end, before I reach 
the last part of the task I have marked out for myself. 
This last part of the task it is, to which I regard all the 
preceding parts as subsidiary. Written as far back as 1842, 
my first essay, consisting of letters on The Proper Sphere of 
Oovemment, vaguely indicated what I conceived to be 
certain general principles of right and wrong in political 
conduct ; and from that time onwards my ultimate purpose, 
lying behind all proximate purposes, has been that of finding 
for the principles of right and wrong in conduct at large, a 
scientific basis. To leave this purpose unfulfilled after 
making so extensive a preparation for fulfilling it, would be 
a failure the probability of which I do not like to contem- 
plate ; and I am anxious to preclude it, if not wholly, still 
partially. Hence the step I now take. Though this first 
division of the work terminating the Synthetic Philosophy, 
cannot, of course, contain the specific conclusions to be set 
forth in the entire work ; yet it implies them in such wise

VlU PREFACE. 

that, definitely to formulate them requires nothing beyond 
logical deduction. 
^ I am the more anxious to indicate in outline, if I cannot 
complete, this final work, because the establishment of rules 
of right conduct on a scientific basis is a pressing need. 
Now that moral injunctions are losing the authority given 
by their supposed sacred origin, the secularization of morals 
is becoming imperative. Few things can happen more 
disastrous than the decay and death of a regulative system 
no longer fit, before another and fitter regulative system has 
grown up to replace it. Most of those who reject the current 
creed, appear to assume that the controlling agency furnished 
by it may safely be thrown aside, and the vacancy left 
unfilled by any other controlling agency. Meanwhile, those 
who defend the current creed allege that in the absence 
of the guidance it yields, no guidance can exist: divine 
commandments they think the only possible guides. Thus 
between these extreme opponents there is a certain 
community. The one holds that the gap left by dis- 
appearance of the code of supernatural ethics, need not be 
filled by a code of natural ethics ; and the other holds that it 
cannot be so filled. Both contemplate a vacuum, which the 
one wishes and the other fears. As the change which 
promises or threatens to bring about this state, desired or 
dreaded, is rapidly progressing, those who believe that the 
vacuum can be filled, and that it must be fiUed, are called 
on to do something in pursuance of their belief. 

To this more special reason I may add a more general 
reason. Great mischief has been done by the repellent 
aspect habitually given to moral rule by its expositors ; and 
immense benefits are to be anticipated from presenting 
moral rule under that attractive aspect which it has when 
undistorted by superstition and asceticism. If a father^ 
sternly enforcing numerous commands, some needful and 
some needless, adds to his severe control a behaviour 
wholly unsympathetic — ^if his children have to take their

pleasures by stealth, or, when timidly looking up from their 
play, ever meet a cold glance or more frequently a frown ; 
his government will inevitably be disliked, if not hated; 
and the aim will be to evade it as much as possible. Con- 
trariwise, a father who, equally firm in maintaining restraints 
needful for the well-being of his children or the well-being 
of other persons, not only avoids needless restraints, but, 
giving his sanction to all legitimate gratifications and pro- 
viding the means for them, looks on at their gambols with an 
approving smile, can scarcely fail to gain an influence which, 
no less efficient for the time being, will also be permanently 
efficient. The controls of such two fathers symbolize the 
controls of Morality as it is and Morality as it should be. 

Nor does mischief result only from this undue severity of 
the ethical doctrine bequeathed us by the harsh past. 
Further mischief results from the impracticability of its ideal. 
In violent reaction against the, utter selfishness of life as 
carried on in barbarous societies, it has insisted on a life 
utterly unselfish. But just as the rampant egoism of a 
<\y^ brutal militancy, was not to be remedied by attempts at the 
absolute subjection of the ego in convents and monasteries ; 
so neither is the misconduct of ordinary humanity as now 
existing, to be remedied by upholding a standard of abnega- 
tion beyond human achievement. Bather the efiect is to 
produce a despairing abandonment of all attempts at a 
higher life. And not only does an effi)rt to achieve the 
impossible, end in this way, but it simultaneously discredits 
the possible. By association with rules that cannot be 
obeyed, rules that can be obeyed lose their authority. 

Much adverse comment will, I doubt not, be passed on the 
theory of right conduct which the following pages shadow 
forth. Critics of a certain class, far from rejoicing that 
ethical principles otherwise derived by them, coincide with 
ethical principles scientifically derived, are ofiended by the 
coincidence. Instead of recognizing essential likeness they 
enlarge on superficial difiFerence. Since the days of perse-

cution^ a curious change lias taken place in the behaviour of 
so-called orthodoxy towards so-called heterodoxy. The time 
was when a heretic, forced by torture to recant, satisfied 
authority by external conformity: apparent agreement 
sufficed, however profound continued to be the real disagree- 
ment. But now that the heretic can no longer be coerced 
into professing the ordina^ belief, his belief is made to 
appear as much opposed to the ordinary as possible. Does 
he diverge from established theological dogma ? Then he 
shall be an atheist ; however inadmissible he considers the 
term. Does he think spiritualistic interpretations of pheno- 
mena not valid ? Then he shall be classed as a materialist ; 
indignantly though he repudiates the name. And in like 
manner, what differences exist between natural morality and 
supernatural morality, it has become the policy to exaggerate 
into fundamental antagonisms. In pursuance of this policy, 
there will probably be singled out for reprobation from this 
volume, doctrines which, taken by themselves, may readily 
be made to seem utterly wrong. With a view to clearness, 
I have treated separately some correlative aspects of conduct, 
drawing conclusions either of which becomes imtrue it 
divorced from the other; and have thus given abundant 
opportimity for misrepresentation. 

The relations of this work to works preceding it in the 
series, are such as to involve frequent reference. Containing, 
as it does, the outcome of principles set forth in each of them, 
I have found it impracticable to dispense with re-statements 
of those principles. Further, the presentation of them in 
their relations to different ethical theories, has made it need- 
ful, in every case, briefly to remind the reader what they are, 
and how they are derived. Hence an amount of repetition 
which to some will pr,obably appear tedious. I do not, 
however, much regret this almost unavoidable result; for 
only by varied iteration can alien conceptions be forced on 
reluctant minds.

CHAPTER If^ 

CONDUCT IN GENERAL. 

§ 1. The doctrine that correlatives imply one another 
—that a father cannot be thought of without thinking of 
a child^ and that there can be no consciousness of superior 
without a consciousness of inferior — ^has for one of its 
common examples the necessary connexion between the 
-conceptions of whole and part. Beyond the primary 
truth that no idea of a whole can be framed without a 
nascent idea of .parts constituting it^ and that no idea of a 
^art can be framed without a nascent idea of some whole to 
^hich it belongs, there is the secondary truth that there 
.can be no correct idea of a part without a correct idea of the 
^correlative whole. There are several ways in which inade- 
quate knowledge of the one involves inadequate knowledge 
df the other. 

If the part is conceived without any reference to the 
whole, it becomes itself a whole — an independent entity; 
and its relations to existence in general are misapprehended. 
Further, the size of the part as compared with the size of 
the whole, must be misapprehended unless the whole is not 
only recognized as including it, but is figured in its total 
extent. And again, the position which the part occupies 
in relation to other parts, cannot be rightly conceived 
unless there is sotne conception of the whole in its distribu- 
tion as well as in its amount.

4 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

Still more when part and whole^ instead of being stati- 
cally related only, are dynamically related, must there be a 
general understanding of the whole before the part can be 
understood. By a savage who ias never seen a vehicle, no 
idea can be formed of the use and action of a wheel. To 
the unsymmetrically-pierced disk of an eccentric, no plac^ 
or purpose can be ascribed by a rustic unacquainted 
with machinery. Even a mechanician, if he has never 
looked into a piano, will, if shown a damper, be unable to- 
conceive its function or relative value. 

Most of all, however, where the whole is organic, does 
complete comprehension of a part imply extensive comprehen- 
sion of the whole. Suppose a being ignorant of the human 
body to find a detached arm. If not misconceived by him 
as a supposed whole, instead of being conceived as a part, still 
its relations to other parts, and its structure, would be wholly^ 
inexplicable. Admitting that the co-operation of its bones 
and muscles might be divined, yet no thought could be 
framed of the share taken by the arm in the actions of the 
unknown whole it belonged to ; nor could any interpretation 
be put upon the nerves and vessels ramifying through it, 
which severally refer to certain central organs. A theory of 
the structure of the arm implies a theory of the structure of 
the body at large. 

And this truth holds not of material aggregates only, 
but of immaterial aggregates — aggregated motions, deeds, 
thoughts, words. The Moon^s movements cannot be fully 
interpreted without taking into account tho movements of 
the Solar System at large. Tho process of loading a gun 
is meaningless until the subsequent actions performed with 
the gun are known. A fragment of a sentence, if not unin- 
telligible, is wrongly interpreted in the absence of the 
remainder. Cut oflf its beginning and end, and the rest of Or 
demonstration proves nothing. Evidence given by a plain- 
tiff often misleads until the evidence which the defendant 
produces is joined with it.

CONDUCT IN GENERAL. 5 

§ 2. Conduct is a wliole ; and^ in a sense^ it is an organic 
whole — an aggregate of inter-dependent actions performed 
by an organism. That division or aspect of conduct 
with which Ethics deals, is a part of this organic whole — s, 
part having its components inextricably bound up with the 
rest. As currently conceived, stirring the fire, or reading 
a newspaper, or eating a meal, are acts with which Morahty 
has no concern. Opening the window to air the room, putting 
on an overcoat when the weather is cold, are thought of as 
having no ethica] significance. These, however, are all 
portions of conduct. The behaviour we call good and the 
behaviour we call bad, are included, along with the behaviour 
we call indiflFerent, under the conception of behaviour at 
large. The whole of which Ethics forms a part, is the 
whole constituted by the theory of conduct in general ; and 
this whole must be understood before the part can be under- 
stood. Let us consider this proposition more closely. 

And first, how shall we define conduct ? It is not co- 
extensive with the aggregate of actions, though it is nearly 
so. Such actions as those of an epileptic in a fit, are 
not included in our conception of conduct : the conception 
excludes purposeless actions. And in recognizing this ex- 
clusion, we simultaneously recognize all that is includei 
The definition of conduct which emerges is either — acts 
adjusted to ends, or else — the adjustment of acts to ends; 
according as we contemplate the formed body of acts, or 
think of the form alone. And conduct in its full acceptation 
must be taken as comprehending all adjustments of acts to 
«nds, from the simplest to the most complex, whatever their 
special natures and whether considered separately or in their 
totality. 

Conduct in general being thus distinguished from the 
somewhat larger whole constituted by actions in general, let 
us next ask what distinction is habitually made between 
the conduct on which ethical judgments are passed and the 
remainder of conduct. As already said, a large part of 



L^

6 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

ordinary conduct is indifferent. Shall I walk to the water-' 
fall to-day ? or shall I ramble along the sea-shore ? Here 
the ends are ethically indifferent. If I go to the waterfall, 
shall I go over the moor or take the path through the 
wood? Here the means are ethically indifferent. And 
from hour to hour most of the things we do are not to 
be judged as either good or bad in respect of either ends or 
mean's. No less clear is it that the transition 

from indifferent acts to acts which are good or bad i& 
gradual. If a friend who is with me has explored the sea« 
shore but has not seen the waterfall, the choice of one or 
other end is no longer ethically indifferent. And if, the 
waterfall being fixed on as our goal, the way oyer the moor 
is too long for his strength, while the shorter way through 
the wood is not, the choice of means is no longer ethically 
indifferent. Again, if a probable result of making the 
one excursion rather than the other, is that I shall not be 
back in time to keep an appointment, or if taking the longer 
route entails this risk while taking the shorter does not, the 
decision in favour of one or other end or means acquires in 
another way an ethical character; and if the appointment 
is one of some importance, or one of great importance, or 
one of life-and-death importance, to self or others, the 
ethical character becomes pronounced. These instances will 
sufficiently suggest the truth that conduct with Which 
Morality is not concerned, passes into conduct which is moral 
or immoral, by small degrees and in countless ways. 

But the conduct that has to be conceived scientifically 
before we can scientifically conceive those modes of conduct 
which are the objects of ethical judgments, is a conduct 
immensely wider in range than that just indicated. Com- 
plete comprehension of conduct is not to be obtained by 
contemplating the conduct of human beings only : we have 
to regard this as a part of universal conduct — conduct as 
exhibited by all living creatures. For evidently this come& 
within our definition — acts adjusted to ends. The con-

fdvict of the higher animals as compared with that of man^ 
and the conduct of the lower animals as compared with that 
of the higher^ mainly differ in this^ that the adjustments 
of acts to ends are relatively simple and relatively incom- 
plete. And as in other cases^ so in this case, we must 
interpret the more developed by the less developed. Just 
as, fuUy to understand the part of conduct which Ethics deals 
with, we must study human conduct as a whole ; so, fully to 
understand human conduct as a whole, we must study it as 
a part of that larger whole constituted by the conduct of 
animate beings in general. 

Nor is even this whole conceived with the needful fulness, 
so long as we think only of the conduct at present dis- 
played around us. We have to include in our conception 
the less-developed conduct out of which this has arisen in 
course of time. We have to regard the conduct now shown 
us by creatures of all orders, as an outcome of the conduct 
which has brought life of every kind to its present height. 
And this is tantamount to saying that our preparatory step 
must be to study the evolution of conduct.

CHAPTER II> 

THE EVOLUTION OF CONDUCT. 

§ 8. We have become quite familiar with the idea of an 
evolution of structures throughout the ascending types of 
animals. To a considerable degree we have become familiar 
with the thought that an e volution of functio ns has gone on 
yari passu with the evolution^fstructures. Now advancing 
a step, we have to frame a conception of the evolation of 
j ^ondu ct, as correlated with this evolution of structures 
and functions. 

These three subjects are to be definitely distinguished. 
Obviously the facts comparative morphology sets forth, 
form a whole which, though it cannot be treated iu general 
or in detail without taking into account facts belonging 
to comparative physiology, is essentially independent. No 
less clear is it that we may devote our attention exclusively 
to that progressive diflferentiation of fanctions, and com- 
bination of functions, which accompanies the development 
of structures — may say no more about the characters 
and connexions of organs than is implied in describing 
their separate and joint actions. And the subject of 
conduct lies outside the subject of functions, if not as far 
as this lies outside the subject of structures, still, far enough 
to make it substantially separate. For those functions 
which are already variously compounded to achieve what we 
regard as single bodily acts, are endlessly re-compounded 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE EVOLUTION OF CONDUCT. 9 

to acHieye tliat co-ordination of bodily acts which is known 
€ts conduct. 

We are concerned with functions in the true sense, while 
we think of them as processes carried on within the body ; 
and, without exceeding the limits of physiology, we may 
treat of their adjusted combinations, so long as these are 
regarded as parts of the vital consensus. If we observe 
how the lungs aerate the blood which the heart sends to 
them; how heart and langs together supply aerated blood to 
the stomach, and so enable it to do its work; how these 
<5o-operate with sundry secreting and excreting glands to 
further digestion and to remove waste matter ; and how all of 
them join to keep the brain in a fit condition for carrying on 
those actions which indirectly conduce to maintenance of the 
•life at large ; we are dealing with functions. Even when 
considering how parts that act directly on the environment — 
legs, arms, wings — perform their duties, we are still concerned 
with functions in that aspect of them constituting physiology, 
€o long as we restrict our attention to internal processes, 
and to internal combinations of them. But 

we enter on the subject of conduct when we begin to 
study such combinations among the actions of sensory and 
motor organs as are externally manifested. Suppose that 
instead of observing those contractions of muscles by which 
the optic axes are converged and the foci of the eyes ad- 
justed (which is a portion of physiology), and that instead 
of observing the co-operation of other nerves, muscles, and 
bones, by which a hand is moved to a particular place and the 
fingers closed (which is also a portion of physiology), we 
observe a weapon being seized by a hand under guidance of 
the eyes. We now pass from the thought of combined 
internal functions to the thought of combined external 
motions. Doubtless if we could trace the cerebral processes 
which accompany these, we should find an inner physio- 
logical co-ordination corresponding with the outer co-ordina- 
tion of actions. But this admission is consistent with the 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



10 THX DATA 09 BTHICS. 

assertion^ ihat when we ignore the internal combination and 
attend only to the external combination^ we pass from a 
portion of physiology to a portion of conduct. For though 
it may be objected that the external combination instanced^ 
is too simple to be rightly included under the name conduct^ 
yet a moment's thought shows that it is joined with what we 
call conduct by insensible gradations. Suppose the weapon 
seized is used to ward off a blow. Suppose a counter- 
blow is given. Suppose the aggressor runs and is chased. 
Suppose there comes a struggle and a handing him over 
to the police. Suppose there follow the many and varied 
acts constituting a prosecution. Obviously the initial 
adjustment of an act to an end^ inseparable from the^ 
rest^ must be included with them under the same general 
headj and obviously from this initial simple adjustment, 
having intrinsically no moral character^ we pass by degrees 
to the most complex adjustments and to those on which 
moral judgments are passed. 

Hence, excluding all internal co-ordinations, our subject- 
here is the aggregate of all external co-ordinations; and thia 
aggregate includes not only the simplest as well as the most 
complex performed by human beings, but also those per- 
formed by all inferior beings considered as less or moro 
evolved. 

§ 4. Already the question — ^What constitutes advance in tho 
evolution of conduct, as we trace it up from the lowest types 
of living creatures to the highest ? has been answered by 
implication. A few examples will now bring the answer into 
conspicuous relief. 

We saw that conduct is distinguished from the totality 
of actions by excluding purposeless actions; but during 
evolution this distinction arises by degrees. In the very 
lowest creatures most of the movements from moment to 
moment made, have not more recognizable aims than have 
the struggles of an epileptic. An infusorium swims randomly

THE EVOLUTION OP CONDUCT. 11 

about^ determined in its coarse not by a perceived object to- 
be pursued or escaped, but, apparently, by varying stimuli 
in its medium ; and its acts, unadjusted in any appreciable 
way to ends, lead it now into contact with some nutritive 
substance which it absorbs, and now into the yighbourhood 
of some creature by which it is swallowed wKL digested. 
Lacking those developed senses and motor Awers which 
higher animals possess, ninety-nine in the hundred of these 
minute animals, severally living for but a few hours, dis- 
appear either by innutrition or by destruction. The conduct 
is constituted of actions so little adjusted to ends, that life 
continues only as long as the accidents of the environment 
are favourable. But when, among aquatic creatures, w& 
observe one which, though still low in type, is much higher 
than the infusorium — say a rotifer — we see how, along 
with larger size, more developed structures, and greater 
power of combining functions, there goes an advance in con- 
duct. We see how by its whirling cilia it sucks in as food 
these small animals moving around ; how by its prehensile 
tail it fixes itself to some fit object; how by withdrawing- 
its outer organs and contracting its body, it preserves itself 
from this or that injury from time to time threatened ; and 
how thus, by better adjusting its own actions, it becomes 
less dependent on the actions going on around, and so pre- 
serves itself for a longer period. 

A superior sub-kingdom, as the Mollusca, still better 
exemplifies this contrast. When we compare a low moUusc^ 
such as a floating ascidian, with a high mollusc, such as a 
cephalopod, we are again shown that greater organic evolu- 
tion is accompanied by more evolved conduct. At the 
mercy of every marine creature large enough to swallow it, 
and drifted about by currents which may chance to keep it 
at sea or may chance to leave it fatally stranded, the 
ascidian displays but little adjustment of acts to ends in 
comparison with the cephalopod ; which, now crawling over 
the beach, now exploring the rocky crevices, now swimming

througli the open water, now darting after a fish, now hiding 
itself from some larger animal in a cloud of ink, and using 
its suckerjed arms at one time for anchoring itself and at 
•another for holding fast its prey ; selects, and combines, and 
proportions, its movements from minute to minute, so as 
to evade dangers which threaten, while utilizing chances of 
food which oflfer : so showing us varied activities which, in 
fichieving special ends, achieve the general end of securing 
continuance of the activities. 

Among vertebrate animals we similarly trace up, along 
with advance in structures and functions, this advance in 
conduct. A fish roaming about at hazard in search of 
something to eat, able to detect it by smell or sight only 
within short distances, and now and again rushing away in 
.alarm on the approach of a bigger fish, makes adjustments of 
acts to ends that are relatively few and simple in their kinds; 
and shows us, as a consequence, how small is the average 
duration of life. So few survive to maturity that, to 
make up for destruction of unhatched young and small 
fry and half -grown individuals, a million ova have to be 
spawned by a cod-fish that two may reach the spawning age. 
Conversely, by a highly-evolved mammal, such as an ele- 
phant, those general actions performed in common with the 
fish are far better adjusted to their ends. By sight as well, 
probably, as by odour, it detects food at relatively great 
-distances ; and when, at intervals, there arises a need f oi 
escape, relatively-great speed is attained. But the chief 
^ifierence arises from the addition of new sets of adjust- 
ments. We have combined actions which facilitate nutrition 
— the breaking off pf succulent and fruit-bearing branches, the 
selecting of edible growths throughout a comparatively wide 
Teach ; and, in case of danger, safety can be achieved not by 
flight only, but, if necessary, by defence or attack : bringing 
into combined use tusks, trunk, and ponderous feet. Fur- 
ther, we see various subsidiary acts adjusted to subsidiary 
ends — now the going into a river for coolness, and using the

timnk as a means of projecting water over the body ; now 
the employment of a bough for sweeping away flies from- 
the back; now the making of signal sounds to alarm 
the herd^ and adapting the actions to such sounds when 
made by others. Evidently, the effect of this more highly- 
evolved conduct is to secure the balance of the organic 
actions throughout far longer periods. 

And now, on studying the doings of the highest of mam- 
' mals, mankind, we not only find that the adjustments of 
acts to ends are both more numerous and better than 
among lower mammals ; but we find the same thing on com- 
paring the doings of higher races of men with those of 
lower races. If we take any one of the major ends achieved,, 
we see greater completeness of achievement by civilized than 
by savage; and we also see an achievement of relatively 
numerous minor ends subserving major ends. Is it in 
nutrition ? The food is obtained more regularly in response 
to appetite ; it is fctr higher in quality ; it is free from dirt y 
it is greater in. variety; it is better prepared. Is it in 
warmth ? The characters of the fabrics and forms of the 
articles used for clothing, and the adaptations of them to 
requirements from day to day and hour to hour, are much 
superior. Is it in dwellings ? Between the shelter of boughs 
and grass which the lowest savage builds, and the mansion of 
the civilized man, the contrast in aspect is not more ex- 
treme than is the contrast in number and eflSciency of 
the adjustments of acts to ends betrayed in their respective 
constructions. And when with the ordinary activities of 
the savage we compare the ordinary civilized activities — 
as the business of the trader, which involves multiplied and 
complex transactions extending over long periods, or as 
professional avocations, prepared for by elaborate studies 
and daily carried on in endlessly-varied forms, or as political 
discussions and agitations, directed now to the carrying of 
this measure and now to the defeating of that, — ^we see sets 
of adjustments of acts to ends, not only immensely exceeding

those seen among lower races of men in variety and intri* 
<5acy, but sets to which lower races of men present nothing 
analogous. And along with this ^eater elaboration of life 
produced by the pursuit of more numerous ends, there 
goes that increased duration of life which constitutes the 
supreme end. 

And here is suggested the need for supplementing this 
<5onception of evolving conduct. For besides being an 
improving adjustment of acts to ends, such as farthers pro- 
longation of life, it is such as furthers increased amount of 
life. Eeconsideration of the examples above given, will 
show that length of life is not by itself a measure of evolu- 
tion of conduct ; but that quantity of life must be taken into 
account. An oyster, adapted by its structure to the diffused 
food contained in the water it draws in, and shielded by its 
shel] from nearly all dangers, may live longer than a cuttle- 
fish, which has such superior powers of dealing with 
numerous contingencies ; but then, the sum of vital 
activities during any given interval is far less in the oyster 
than in the cuttle-fish. So a worm, ordinarily sheltered from 
most enemies by the earth it burrows through, which also 
supplies a suflSciency of its poor food, may have greater 
longevity than many of its annulose relatives, the insects ; 
but one of these during its existence as larva and imago, 
may experience a greater quantity of the changes which con- 
stitute life. Nor is it otherwise when we compare the more 
evolved with the less evolved among mankind. The differ- 
ence between the average lengths of the Kves of savage and 
civilized, is no true measure of the difference between the 
totahties of their two lives, considered as* aggregates of 
thought, feehng, and action. Hence, estimating life by 
multiplying its length into its breadth, we must say that the 
augmentation of it which accompanies evolution of conduct, 
results from increase of both factors. The more multiplied 
and varied adjustments of acts to ends, by which the more 
developed creature from hour to hour fulfils more numerous

requirements, severally add to the activities that are carried 
on abreast, and severally help to make greater the period 
through which such simultaneous activities endure. Each 
further evolution of conduct widens the aggregate of actions 
while conducing to elongation of it. 

§ 5. Turn we now to a further aspect of the phenomena, 
.«eparatd^om, but necessarily associated with, the last. 
Thus far we have considered only those adjustments of acts 
io ends which have for their final purpose complete individual 
life. Now we have to consider those adjustments which have 
for their final purpose the life of the species. 

Self-preservation in each generation has all along depended 
on the preservation of offspring by preceding generations. 
And in proportion as evolution of the conduct subserving 
individual life is high, implying high organization, there 
must previously have been a highly-evolved conduct sub- 
:serving nurture of the young. Throughout the ascending 
grades of the animal kingdom, this second kind of conduct 
presents stages of advance like those which we have observed 
in the first. Low down, where structures and functions are 
little developed, and the power of adjusting acts to ends 
but slight, there is no conduct, properly so named, further- 
ing salvation of the species. Eace-maintaining conduct, like 
self -maintaining conduct, arises gradually out of that which 
<;annot be called conduct: adjusted actions are preceded 
by unadjusted ones. Protozoa spontaneously divide 

and sub-divide, in consequence of physical changes over 
which they have' no control ; or, at other times, after a period 
of quiescence, break up into minute portions which severally 
grow into new individuals. In neither case can conduct 
be alleged. Higher up, the process is that of ripening, at 
intervals, germ-cells and sperm-cells, which, on occasion, 
are sent forth into the surrounding water and left to their 
fate: perhaps one in ten thousand surviving to maturity. 
Here, again, we see only development and dispersion

going on apart from parental care. Types above these, a& 
fish wHcli choose fit places in which to deposit their ova, 
or as the higher crustaceans which carry masses of ova 
about until they are hatched, exhibit adjustments of acts 
to ends which we may properly call conduct ; though it is of 
the simplest kind. Where, as among certain fish, the male 
keeps guard over the eggs, driving away intruders, there is 
an additional adjustment of acts to ends ; and the appli- 
cability of the name conduct is more decided. Passing 
at once to creatures far superior, such as birds which, 
building nests and sitting on their eggs, feed their broods 
for considerable periods, and give them aid after they can 
fly; or such as mammals which, suckling their young for a 
time, continue afterwards to bring them food or protect. 

, them while they feed, until they reach ages at which they 
can provide for themselves ; we are shown how this conduct 

, which furthers race-maintenance evolves hand-in-hand with 
the conduct which furthers self-maintenance. That better 
organization which makes possible the last, makes possible 
the first also. Mankind exhibit a great progress 

of like nature. Compared with brutes, the savage, higher 
in his self -maintaining conduct, is higher too in his race-main- 
taining conduct. A larger number of the wants of offspring 
are provided for;' and parental care, enduring longer, 
extends to the disciplining of offspring in arts and habits 
which fit them for their conditions of existence. Conduct of 
this order, equally with conduct of the first order, we see 
becoming evolved in a still greater degree as we ascend 
from savage to civilized. The adjustments of acts to ends 
in the rearing of children become far more elaborate, alike 
in number of ends met, variety of means used, and efficiency 
of their adaptations ; and the aid and oversight are continued 
throughout a much greater part of early life. 

In tracing up the evolution of conduct, so that we may 
frame a true conception of conduct in general, we have thus 
to recognize these two kinds as mutually dependent. Speak-

ing generally, neither can evolve without evolution of the 
other ; and the highest evolutions of the two must be reached 
simultaneously. 



f. 



§ 6. To conclude, however, that on reaching a perfect 
adjustment of acts to ends subserving individual life and 
' the rearing of oflfspring, the evolution of conduct becomes 
complete, is to conclude erroneously. Or rather, I should 
say, it is an error to suppose that either of these kinds of 
conduct can assume its highest form, without its highest 
form being assumed by a third kind of conduct yet to be 
named. 

The multitudinous creatures of all kinds which fill the 
Earth, cannot live wholly apart from one another, but are more 
or less in presence of one another — are interfered with by 
one another. In large measure the adjustments of ' acts to 
ends which we have been considering, are components of 
that "struggle for existence '^ carried on both between 
members of the same species and between members of 
different species ; and, very generally, a successful adjust- 
ment made by one creature involves an unsuccessful adjust- 
ment made by another creature, either of the same kind or 
of a different kind. That the carnivore may live herbivores 
must die ; and that its young may be reared the young of 
weaker creatures must be orphaned. Maintenance of the 
hawk and its brood involves the deaths of many small birds; 
and that small birds may multiply, their progeny must 
be fed with innumerable sacrificed worms and larva). 
Competition among members of the same species has allied, 
though less conspicuous, results. The stronger often carries 
off by force the prey which the weaker has caught. Mono- 
polizing certain hunting grounds, the more ferocious drive 
others of their kind into less favourable places. With plant- 
eating animals, too, the like holds : the better food is secured 
by the more vigorous individuals, while the less vigorous 
and worse fed, succumb either directly from innutrition or

indirectly from restdting inability to escape enemies. That 
18 to say^ among creatures whose lives are caiTied on anta- 
gonistically^ each of the two kinds of conduct delineated 
above, must remain imperfectly evolved. Even in such few 
kinds of them as have little to fear from enemies or compe- 
titors, as lions or tigers, there is still inevitable failure in 
the adjustments of acts to ends towards the close of life. 
Death by starvation from inabiUty to catch prey, shows a 
falUng short of conduct from its ideal. 

This imperfectly-evolved conduct introduces us by asso- 
ciation to conduct that is perfectly evolved. Contemplating 
these adjustments of acts to ends which miss completeness 
because they cannot be made by one creature without other 
creatures being prevented from making them, raises the 
thought of adjustments such that each creature may make 
ihem without preventing them from being made by other 
creatures. That the highest form of conduct must be so 
distinguished, is an inevitable implication ; for while the form 
of conduct is such that adjustments of acts to ends by some 
necessitate non-adjustments by others, there remains room 
for modifications which bring conduct into a form avoiding 
this, and so making the totality of life greater. 

From the abstract let us pass to the concrete. Recogniz- 
ing men as the beings whose conduct is most evolved, let 
us ask under what conditions their conduct, in all three 
aspects of its evolution, reaches its limit. Clearly while 
the lives led are entirely predatory^ as those of savages, the 
adjustments of acts to ends fall short of this highest form 
of conduct in every way. Individual life, ill carried on 
from hour to hour, is prematurely cut short ; the fostering 
of offspring often fails, and is incomplete when it does not 
fail ; and in so far as the ends of self-maintenance and race- 
maintenance are met, they are met by destruction of other 
beings, of different kind or of like kind. In social groups 
formed by compounding and re-compounding primitive hordes, 
conduct remains imperfectly evolved in proportion as there

eontinue antagonisms between the groups and antagonisms 
between members of the same group — two traits necessarily 
associated] since the nature which prompts internationa] 
aggression prompts aggression of individuals on one another. 
Hence the limit of evolution can be reached by conduct only | 
in permanently peaceful societies. That perfect adjustment 
of acts to ends in maintaining individual life and rearing 
new individuals, which is eflFected by each without hindering 
others from effecting like perfect adjustments, is, in its very 
definition, shown to constitute a kind of conduct that can 
be approached only as war decreases and dies out. 

A gap in this outline must now be filled up. There remains 
a further advance not yet even hinted. For beyond so 
behaving that each achieves his ends without preventing 
others from achieving their ends, the members of a society 
may give mutual help in the achievement of ends. And if, 
either indirectly by industrial co-operation, or directly by 
volunteered aid, fellow citizens can make easier for one 
another the adjustments of acts to ends^ then their conduct 
assumes a still higher phase of evolution ; since whatever 
facilitates the making of adjustments by each, increases the 
totality of the adjustments made, and serves to render the 
lives of all more complete. 

§ 7. The reader who recalls certain passages in First Prin- 
ciples, in the Principles of Biology, and in the Principles of 
Psychology, will perceive above a re-statement, in another 
form, of generalizations set forth in those works. Especially 
will he be reminded of the proposition that Life is ^^ the 
definite combination of heterogeneous changes, both simul- 
taneous and successive, in correspondence with external 
, coexistences and sequences/' and still more of that 
abridged and less specific formula, in which Life is said to 
be "the continuous adjustment of internal relations to 
external relations.^' 

The presentation of the facts here made, diflFers from the

20 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

presentations before made^ mainly by ignoring the inner 
part of the correspondence and attending exclusively to that 
outer part constituted of visible actions. But the two are in 
harmony; and the reader who wishes further to prepare him- 
self for dealing with our present topic from the evolution 
point of view, may advantageously join to the foregoing 
more special aspect of the phenomena, the more general 
aspects before delineated. 

After this passing remark, I recur to the main proposi- 
tion set forth in these two chapters, which has, I think, 
been fully justified. Guided by the truth that as the con- 
duct with which Ethics deals is part of conduct at large, 
conduct at large must be generally understood before this 
part can be specially understood ; and guided by the further 
truth that to understand conduct at large we must under- 
stand the evolution of conduct ; we have been led to see 
that Ethics has for its subject-matter, that form which 
universal conduct assumes during the last stages of its 
evolution. We have also concluded that these last stages 
in the evolution of conduct are those displayed by the 
highest type of being, when he is forced, by increase of 
numbers, to live more and more in presence of his fellows. 
And there has followed the corollary that conduct gains 
ethical sanction in proportion as the activities, becoming 
less and less militant and more and more industrial, 
are such as do not necessitate mutual injury or hindrance, 
but consist with, and are furthered by, co-operation and 
mutual aid. 

These implications of the Evolution-Hypothesis, we shall 
now see harmonize with the leading moral ideas men have 
otherwise reached.

CHAPTER inp 

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 

§ 8. By comparing its meanings in different connexions 
and observing what they have in common, we learn the 
essential meaning of a word ; and the essential meaning of 
a word that is variously applied, may best be leamt by 
comparing with one another those applications of it which 
diverge most widely. Let us thus ascertain what good and 
bad mean. 

In which cases do we distinguish as good, a knife, a gnn, 
a house? And what trait leads us to speak of a bad 
umbrella or a bad pair of boots ? The characters here 
predicated by the words good and bad, are not intrinsic 
characters ; for apart from human wants, such things have 
neither merits nor demerits. We call these articles good 
or bad according as they are well or ill adapted to achieve 
prescribed ends. The good knife is one which will cut; 
the good gun is one which carries far and true; the 
good house is one which duly yields the shelter, comfort, 
and accommodation sought for. Conversely, the badness 
alleged of the umbrella or the pair of boots, refers to their 
failures in fulfilling the ends of keeping off the rain and 
comfortably protecting the feet, with due regard to appear- 
ances. So is it when we pass from inanimate objects 
to inanimate actions. We call a day bad in which storms 
prevent us from satisfying certain of our desires. A

good season is the expression used when the weather 
has favoured the production of valuable crops. If 

from lifeless things and actions we pass to living ones, we 
similarly find that these words in their current applications 
refer to efficient subservience. The goodness or badness of 
a pointer or a hunter, of a sheep or an ox, ignoring all other 
attributes of these creatures, refer in the one case to the 
fitness of their actions for effecting the ends men use them 
for, and in the other case to the qualities of their flesh as 
adapting it to support human life. And those doings of 

men which, morally considered, are indifferent, we class as 
good or bad according to their success or failure. A good 
jump is a jump which, remoter ends ignored, well achieves 
the immediate purpose of a jump ; and a stroke at billiards 
is called good when the movements are skilfully adjusted to 
the requirements. Oppositely, the badness of a walk that 
is shuffling and an utterance that is indistinct, is alleged 
because of the relative non-adaptations of the acts to the 
ends. 

Thus recognizing the meanings of good and bad as other- 
wise used, we shall understand better their meanings as 
used in characterizing conduct under its ethical aspects. 
Here, too, observation shows that we apply them according 
as the adjustments of acts to ends are, or are not, efficient. 
This truth is somewhat disguised. The entanglement of 
social relations is such, that men's actions often simul- 
taneously affect the welfares of self, of offspring, and of 
fellow-citizens. Hence results confusion in judging of 
actions as good or bad ; since actions well fitted to achieve 
ends of one order, may prevent ends of the other orders from 
being achieved. Nevertheless, when we disentangle the 
three orders of ends, and consider each separately, it be- 
comes clear that the conduct which achieves each kind 
of end is regarded as relatively good; and is regarded as 
relatively bad if it fails to achieve it. 

Take first the primary set of adjustments — ^those sub-

serving individual life. Apart from approval or disapproval 
of his ulterior aims^ a man who fights is said to make a good 
defence^ if his defence is well adapted for self-preservation; 
and^ the judgments on other aspects of his conduct remain- 
ing the same^ he brings down on himselE an unfavourable* 
verdict; in so far as his immediate acts are concerned^ i£ 
these are futile. The goodness ascribed to a man of 
business^ as such^ is measured by the activity and ability 
with which he buys and sells to advantage; and may 
coexist with a hard treatment of dependents which is repro- 
bated. Though in repeatedly lending money to a friend who 
sinks one loan after another^ a man is doing that which^ con- 
sidered in itself is held praiseworthy ; yet^ if he does it to the 
extent of bringiug on his own ruin, he is held blameworthy 
for a self-sacrifice carried too &r. And thus is it with the 
opinions we express from hour to hour on those acts of 
people around which bear on their health and personal wel- 
fare. *' You should not have done that ; '* is the reproof 
given to one who crosses the street amid a dangerous rush 
of vehicles. '' You ought to have changed your clothes ;'* is 
said to another who has taken cold after getting wet. " You 
were right to take a receipt ;^' *' you were wrong to invest 
without advice ;^' are common criticisms. All such approving 
and disapproving utterances make the tacit assertion that, 
other things equal, conduct is right or wrong according as 
its special acts, well or ill adjusted to special ends, do or 
do not further the general end of self-preservation. 

These ethical judgments we pass on self-regarding acts 
are ordinarily little emphasized ; partly because the prompt- 
ings of the self-regarding desires, generally strong enough, 
do not need moral enforcement, and partly because the 
promptings of the other-regarding desires, less strong, and 
often over-ridden, do need moral enforcement. Hence 
results a contrast. On turning to that second class of 
adjustments of acts to ends which subserve the rearing of 
ofifspring, we no longer find any obscurity in the appUcation.

24 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

of the words good and bad to them, according as they are 
eflBcient or ineflGicient. The expressions good nursing and 
bad nursing, whether they refer to the supply of food, the 
quality and amount of clothing, or the due ministration 
to infantine wants from hour to hour, tacitly recognize as 
special ends which ought to be fulfilled, the furthering of 
the vital functions, with a view to the general end of con- 
tinued life and growth. A mother is called good who, 
ministering to all the physical needs of her children, also 
adjusts her behaviour in ways conducive to their mental 
health ; and a bad father is one who either does not provide 
the necessaries of life for his family, or otherwise acts in a 
manner injurious to their bodies or minds. Similarly of the 
education given to them, or provided for them. Goodness or 
badness is affirmed of it (often with little consistency, how- 
ever) according as its methods are so adapted to physical 
and psychical requirements, as to further the children's lives 
for the time being, while preparing them for carrying on 
complete and prolonged adult life. 

Most emphatic, however, are the applications of the words 
good and bad to conduct throughout that third division of 
it comprising the deeds by which men aflEect one another. 
In maintaining their own lives and fostering their oflFspring, 
men^s adjustments of acts to ends are so apt to hinder the 
kindred adjustments of other men, that insistance on the 
needful limitations has to be perpetual ; and the mischiefs 
caused by men's interferences with one another's life-sub- 
serving actions are so great, that the interdicts have to be 
peremptory. Hence the fact that the words good and 
bad have come to be specially associated with acts which 
further the complete living of others and acts which 
obstruct their complete Hving. Goodness, standing by itself, 
suggests, above all other things, the conduct of one who 
aids the sick in re-acquiring normal vitality, assists the 
unfortunate to recover the means of maintaining themselves, 
defends those who are threatened with harm in person, pro-

perty, or reputation, and aids whatever promises to improve 
the living of all his fellows. Contrariwise, badness brings to 
mind, as its leading correlative, the conduct of one who, in- 
carrying on his own life, damages the lives of others by 
injuring their bodies, destroying their possessions, defraud- 
ing them, calumniating them. 

Always, then, acts are called good or bad, according as 
they are well or iU adjusted to ends ; and whatever incon- 
sistency there is in our uses of the words, arises from 
inconsistency of the ends. Here, however, the study of 
conduct in general, and of the evolution of conduct, have 
prepared us to harmonize these interpretations. The fore- 
going exposition shows that the conduct to which we apply 
the name good, is the relatively more evolved conduct; and i 
that bad is the name we apply to conduct which is relatively/ 
less evolved. We saw that evolution, tending ever towards' 
self-preservation, reaches its limit when individual life is the 
greatest, both in length and breadth ; and now we see that, 
leaving other ends aside, we regard as good the conduct 
furthering self-preservation, and as bad the conduct tending 
to self-destruction. It was shown that along with increas- 
ing power of maintaining individual life, which evolution 
brings, there goes increasing power of perpetuating the 
species by fostering progeny, and that in this direction evolu- 
tion reaches its limit when the needful number of young, 
preserved to maturity, are then fit for a life that is com- 
plete in fulness and duration ; and here it turns out that 
parental conduct is called good or bad as it approaches or 
falls short of this ideal result. Lastly, we inferred that 
establishment of an associated state, both makes possible 
and requires a form of conduct such that life may be com- 
pleted in each and in his offspring, not only without pre- 
venting completion of it in others, but with furtherance of 
it in others ; and we have found above, that this is the form 
of conduct most emphatically termed good. Moreover, just 
as we there saw that evolution becomes the highest possible 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



26 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

when the conduct simultaneoosly achieves the greatest 
totality of life in self, in offspring, and in fellow men ; so 
here we see that the conduct called good rises to the con- 
duct conceived as best, when it fulfils all three classes of 
ends at the same time. 

§ 9. Is there any postulate involved in these judgments 
on conduct ? Is there any assumption made in calling good 
the acts conducive to life, in self or others, and bad those 
which directly or indirectly tend towards death, special or 
general? Yes; an ^assumption of extreme significance has 
been made— an assumption underlying all moral estimates. 

The question to be definitely raised and answered before 
entering on any ethical discussion, is the question of late 
much agitated — Is life worth living? Shall we take the 
pessimist view ? or shall we take the optimist view ? or 
shall we, after weighing pessimistic and optimistic argu- 
ments, conclude that the balance is in favour of a qualified 
optimism ? 

On the answer to this question depends entirely every 
decision concerning the goodness or badness of conduct. 
By those who think life is not a benefit but a misfortune, 
conduct which prolongs it is to be blamed rather than 
praised : the ending of an undesirable existence being the 
thing to be wished, that which causes the ending of it must 
be applauded; while actions furthering its continuance, 
either in self or others, must be reprobated. Those who, 
on the other hand, take an optimistic view, or who, if noi 
pure optimists, yet hold that in life the good exceeds the 
evil, are committed to opposite estimates ; and must regard 
as conduct to be approved that which fosters life in self 
and others, and as conduct to be disapproved that which 
injures or endangers life in self or others. 

The ultimate question, therefore, is — ^Has evolution been 
a mistake ; and especially that evolution which improves the 
adjustment of acts to ends in ascending stages of organiza-

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 27 

tion ? If it is held that there had better not have been any 
animate existence at all^ and that the sooner it comes to an 
end the better ; then one set of conclusions with respect to 
conduct emerges. If, contrariwise, it is held that there is a 
balance in favour of animate existence, and if, still further, 
it is held that in the future this balance may be increased ; 
then the opposite set of conclusions emerges. Even should 
it be alleged that the worth of life is not to be judged by its 
intrinsic character, but rather by its extrinsic sequences — 
by certain results to be anticipated when life has passed 
— ^the ultimate issue re-appears in a new shape. Fop 
though the accompanying creed may negative a deliberate 
shortening of life that is miserable, it cannot justify a 
gratuitous lengthening of such life. Legislation conducive 
to increased longevity would, on the pessimistic view, remain 
blameable ; while it would be praiseworthy on the optimistic 
view. 

^ But now, have these irreconcilable opinions anything in 
common ? Men being divisible into two schools differing 
on this ultimate question, the inquiry arises — Is there 
anything which their radically-opposed views alike take for 
granted ? In the optimistic proposition, tacitly made when 
using the words good and bad after the ordinary manner ; 
and in the pessimistic proposition overtly made, which 
implies that the words good and bad should be used in 
the reverse senses ; does examination disclose any joint pro- 
position — any proposition which, contained in both of them, 
may be held more certain than either — ^any universally- 
asserted proposition ? 

§ 10. Yes, there is one postulate in which pessimists and 
optimists agree. Both their arguments assume it to be self- 
evident that life is good or bad, according as it does, or does 
not, bring a surplus of agreeable feeling. The pessimist 
says he condemns life because it results in more pain than 
pleasure. The optimist defends life in the belief that it

28 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

brings more pleasure tlian pain. Each makes the kind of sen- 
tiency which accompanies life the test. They agree that the 
justification for life as a state of being, turns on this issue— 
whether the average consciousness rises above indifPerence- 
point into pleasurable feeling or falls below it into painful 
feeling. The implication common to their antagonist views 
is, that conduct should conduce to preservation of the indi- 
vidual, of the family, and of the society, only supposing that 
life brings more happiness than misery. 

Changing the venue cannot alter the verdict. If either 
the pessimist, while saying that the pains of life predominate, 
or the optimist, while saying that the pleasures predominate, 
urges that the pains borne here are to be compensated by 
pleasures received hereafter; and that so life, whether 
or not justified in its immediate results, is justified in 
its ultimate results; the implication remains the same. 
The decision is still reached by balancing pleasures against 
pains. Animate existence would be judged by both a 
curse, if to a surplus of misery borne here, were added 
a surplus of misery to be borne hereafter. And for either 
to regard animate existence as a blessing, if here its pains 
were held to exceed its pleasures, he must hold that here- 
after its pleasures will exceed its pains. Thus there is no 
escape from the admission that in calling good the conduct 
which subserves life, and bad the conduct which hinders or 
destroys it, and in so implying that life is a blessing and not 
a curse, we are inevitably asserting that conduct is good or 
bad according as its total effects are pleasurable or painful. 

One theory only is imaginable in pursuance of which 
other interpretations of good and bad can be given. This 
theory is that men were created with the intention that they 
should be sources of misery to themselves ; and that they are 
bound to continue living that their creator may have the 
satisfaction of contemplating their misery. Though this is 
not a theory avowedly entertained by many — ^though it is 
not formulated by any in this distinct way ; yet not a few do

accept it under a disguised form. Inferior creeds are per- 
vaded by the belief that the sight of suffering is pleasing to 
the gods. Derived from bloodthirsty ancestors^ such gods 
are naturally conceived as gratified by the infliction of pain : 
when living they delighted in torturing other beings ; and 
witnessing torture is supposed still to give them delight. 
The implied conceptions long survive. It needs but to name 
Indian fakirs who hang on hooks and Eastern dervishes who 
gash themselves^ to show that in societies considerably ad- 
vanced^ are still to be found many who think that submission 
to anguish brings divine favour. And without enlarging 
on fasts and penances^ it will be clear that there has existed^ 
and still exists^ among Christian peoples^ the belief that 
the Deity whom Jephthah thought to propitiate by sacri- 
ficing his daughter^ may be propitiated by self-infiicted 
pains. Further, the conception accompanying this, that acts 
pleasing to self are offensive to God, has survived along with 
it, and still widely prevails ; if not in formulated dogmas, 
yet in beliefs that are manifestly operative. >/ 

Doubtless, in modem days such beliefs have assumed 
qualified forms. The satisfaction which ferocious gods were 
supposed to feel in contemplating tortures, has been, in large 
measure, transformed int(5 the satisfaction felt by a deity 
in contemplating that self -infliction of pain which is held 
to further eventual happiness. But clearly those who enter- 
tain this modified view, are excluded from the class whose 
position we are here considering. Eestricting ourselves to 
this class — supposing that from the savage who immolates 
victims to a cannibal god, there are descendants among the 
civilized, who hold that mankind were made for suflFering, 
and that it is their duty to continue living in misery for the 
delight of their maker, we can only recognize the fact that 
devil-worshippers are not yet extinct. 

Omitting people of this class, if there are any, as beyond 
or beneath argument, we find that all others avowedly or 
tacitly hold that the final justification for maintaining life.

can only be the reception from it of a surplus of pleasurable 
feeling over painfiil feeling ; and that goodness or badness 
can be ascribed to acts which subserve life or hinder life, 
only on this supposition. 
/ And here we are brought round to those primary mean- 
ings of the words good and bad, which we i>assed over 
when considering their secondary meanings. For on 
remembering, that we call good and bad the things which 
immediately produce agreeable and disagreeable sensations, 
and also the sensations themselves — a good wine, a good 
appetite, a bad smell, a bad headache — we see that by 
referring directly to pleasures and pains, these meanings 
harmonize with those which indirectly refer to pleasures 
and pains. If we call good the enjoyable state itself, as a 
good laugh— if we call good the proximate cause of an 
enjoyable state, as good music — if we call good any agent 
which conduces immediately or remotely to an enjoyable 
state, as a good shop, a good teacher — if we call good 
considered intrinsically, each act so adjusted to its end as 
to further self-preservation and that surplus of enjoyment 
which makes self-preservation desirable — if we call good 
every kind of conduct which aids the lives of others, and 
do this under the belief that life brings more happiness 
than misery ; then it becomes undeniable that, taking into 
account immediate and remote effects on all persons, the 
good is universally the pleasurable, 

§ 11. Sundry influences — moral, theological, and political 
— conspire to make people disguise from themselves this 
truth. As in narrower cases so in this widest case, they 
become so pre-occupied with the means by which an end is 
achieved, as eventually to mistake it for the end. Just as 
money, which is a means of satisfying wants, comes to be 
regarded by a miser as the sole thing to be worked for, 
leaving the wants unsatisfied; so the conduct men have 
found preferable because most conducive to happiness, has

come to be thought of as intrinsically preferable : not only to 
be made a proximate end (which it should be), but to 
be made an ultimate end, to the exclusion of the true 
ultimate end. And yet cross-examination quickly compels 
everyone to confess the true ultimate end. Just as the 
miser, asked to justify himself, is obliged to allege the 
power of money to purchase desirable things, as his reason 
for prizing it; so the moralist who thinks this conduct 
intrinsically good and that intrinsically bad, if pushed 
home, has no choice but to fall back on their pleasure-giving 
and pain-giving effects. To prove this it needs but to 
observe how impossible it would be to think of them as we 
do, if their effects were reversed. 

Suppose that gashes and bruises caused agreeable sensa- 
tions, and brought in their train increased power of doing 
work and receiving enjoyment; should we regard assault in 
the same manner as at present? Or suppose that self- 
mutilation, say by cutting oflF a hand, was both intrinsically 
pleasant and furthered performance of the processes by 
which personal welfare and the welfare of dependents is 
achieved; should we hold as now, that deliberate injury to 
one^s own body is to be reprobated ? Or again, suppose that 
picking a man's pocket excited in him joyful emotions, by 
brightening his prospects; would theft be counted among 
crimes, as in existing law-books and moral codes ? In these 
extreme cases, no one can deny that what we call the 
badness of -actions is ascribed to them solely for the reason 
that they entail pain, immediate or remote, and would not be 
so ascribed did they entail pleasure. 

If we examine our conceptions on their obverse side, this 
general fact forces itself on our attention with equal dis- 
tinctness. Imagine that ministering to a sick person always 
increased the pains of illness. Imagine that an orphan's 
relatives who took charge of it, thereby necessarily brought 
miseries upon it. Imagine that liquidating another man's 
pecuniary claims on you redounded to his disadvantage.

TmagiTie that crediting a man with noble behaviour hindered 
his social welfare and consequent gratification. What should 
we say to these acts which now fall into the class we call 
praiseworthy ? Should we not contrariwise class them as 
blameworthy ? 

TJsing^ then^ as our tests^ these most pronounced forms of 
good and bad conduct^ we find it unquestionable that our 
ideas of their goodness and badness reaUy originate from 
our consciousness of the certainty or probability that they will 
produce pleasures or pains somewhere. And this truth is 
brought out with equal clearness by examiniag the standards 
of different moral schools; for analysis shows that every 
one of them derives its authority from this ultimate standard. 
Ethical systems are roughly distinguishable according as 
they take for their cardinal ideas (1) the character of the 
agent ; (2) the nature of his motive ; (3) the quality of his 
deeds ; and (4) the results. Each of these may be character- 
ized as good or bad; and those who do not estimate a mode 
of life by its effects on happiness^ estimate it by the implied 
goodness or badness in the agent^ in his motive^ or in his 
deeds. We have perfection in the agent set up as a test by 
which conduct is to be judged. Apart from the agent we 
have his feeling considered as moral. And apart from the 
feeling we have his action considered as virtuous. 

Though the distinctions thus indicated have so little 
definiteness that the words marking them are used inter- 
changeably, yet there correspond to them doctrines partially 
unlike one another ; which we may here conveniently examine 
separately, with the view of showing that all their tests of 
goodness are derivative. 

§ 12. It is strange that a notion so abstract a& that of 
perfection, or a certain ideal completeness of nature, should 
ever have been thought one from which a system of guidance 
can be evolved; as it was in a general way by Plato 
and more distinctly by Jonathan Edwards. Perfection is

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 83 

synonymous with goodness in tlie highest degree j aad hence 
to define good conduct in terms of perfection, is indirectly to 
define good conduct in terms of itself. Naturally, therefore, 
it happens that the notion of perfection like the notion of 
goodness can be framed only in relation to ends. 

We allege imperfection of any inanimate thing, as a tool, 
if it lacks some part needful for eflTectual action, or if some 
part is so shaped as not to fulfil its purpose in the best 
manner. Perfection is alleged of a watch if it keeps exact 
time, however plain its case ; and imperfection is alleged of 
it because of inaccurate time-keeping, however beautifully 
it is ornamented. Though we call things imperfect if 
we detect in them any injuries or flaws, even when these 
do not detract from efficiency ; yet we do this because they 
imply that inferior workmanship, or that wear and tear, 
with which inefficiency is commonly joined in experience : 
absence of minor imperfections being habitually associated 
with absence of major imperfections. 

As applied to living things, the word perfection has the 
same meaning. The idea of perfect shape in a race-horse is 
derived by generalization from those observed traits of race- 
horses which have usually gone along with attainment of 
the highest speed ; and the idea of perfect constitution in a 
race-horse similarily refers to the endurance which enables 
him to continue that speed for the longest time. With men, 
physically considered, it is the same : we are able to furnish 
no other test of perfection, than that of complete power in all 
the organs to fulfil their respective functions. That our 
conception of perfect balance among the internal parts, and 
of perfect proportion among the external parts, originates 
thus, is made clear by observing that imperfection of any 
viscus, as lungs, heart, or liver, is ascribed for no other 
reason than inability to meet in full the demands which 
the activities of the organism make on it ; and on observ- 
ing that the conceptiou of insufficient size, or of too great 
size, in a limb, is derived from accumulated experiences 

8

84 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

respecting that ratio among the limbs which farthers in the 
highest degree the performance of all needful actions. 

And of perfection in mental nature we have no other 
measure. If imperfection of memory, of judgment, of temper, 
is alleged, it is alleged because of inadequacy to the require- 
ments of life; and to imagine a perfect balance of the 
intellectual powers and of the emotions, is to imagine that 
proportion among them which ensures an entire discharge 
of each and every obligation as the occasion calls for it. 

So that the perfection of man considered as an agent, means 
the being constituted for effecting complete adjustment 
of acts to ends of every kind. And since, as shown above, 
the complete adjustment of acts to ends is that which both 
secures and constitutes the life that is most evolved, alike 
in breadth and length ; while, as also shown, the justifica- 
tion for whatever increases life is the reception from life of 
more happiness than misery ; it follows that conduciveness 
to happiness is the ultimate test of perfection in a man's 
nature. To be fully convinced of this it needs but to observe 
how the proposition looks when inverted. It needs but to 
suppose that every approach towards perfection involved 
greater misery to self, or others, or both, to show by opposi- 
tion that approach to perfection really means approach to 
that which secures greater happiness.

moralists who, having decided empirically or rationally, induc-

character we call virtuous, argue that such acts are to be 
performed without regard to proximate consequences : these 
have ample justification. But I refer to moralists who 
suppose themselves to have conceptions of virtue as an end, 
nnderived from any other end — ^who think that the idea of 
virtue is not resolvable into simpler ideas.

This is the doctrine which appears to have been enter- 
tained by Aristotle. I say^ appears to have been^ because his 
statements are far from consistent with one another. Recog- 
nizing happiness as the supreme end of human endeavour, 
it would at first sight seem that he cannot be taken as 
typical of those who make virtue the supreme end. Yet 
he puts himself in this Category by seeking to define 
happiness in terms of virtue, instead of defining virtue in 
terms of happiness. The imperfect separation of words 
from things, which characterizes Greek speculation in general, 
leems to have been the cause of this. In primitive thought 
the name and the object named, are associated in such 
wise that the one is regarded as a part of the other — so 
much so, that knowing a savage^s name is considered by him 
as having some of his being, and a consequent power to work 
evil on him. This belief in a real connexion between word 
and thing, continuing through lower stages of progress, and 
long surviving in the tacit assunjption that the meanings of 
words are intrinsic, pervades the dialogues of Plato, and is 
traceable even in Aristotle. For otherwise it is not easy 
to see why he should have so incompletely dissociated 
the abstract idea of happiness from particular forms of 
happiness. Naturally where the divorcing of 

words as symbols, from things as symbolized, is imperfect, 
there must be difficulty in giving to abstract words a 
sufficiently abstract meaning. If in the first stages of 
language the concrete name cannot be separated in thought 
from the concrete object it belongs to, it is inferable that in 
the course of forming successively higher grades of abstract 
names, there will have to be resisted the tendency to» 
interpret each more abstract name in terms of some one 
class of the less abstract names it covers. Hence, I think, 
the fact that Aristotle supposes happiness to be associated 
with some one order of human activities, rather than with 
all orders of human activities. Instead of including in 
it the pleasurable feelings accompanying actions that

constitute mere livings whicli actions lie says man has in 
common with vegetables ; and instead of making it include 
the mental states which the life of external perception yields, 
which he says man has in common with animals at large ; he 
excludes these from his idea of happiness^ and includes in it 
only the modes of consciousness accompanying rational life. 
Asserting that the proper work of man '^ consists in the 
active exercise of the mental capacities conformably to 
reason/' he concludes that ''the supreme good of man 
will consist in performing this work with excellence 
or virtue: herein he will obtain happiness/' And 
he finds confirmation for his view in its correspondence 
with views previously enunciated; saying — ''our notion 
nearly agrees with theirs who place happiness in virtue ; for 
we say that it consists in the action of virtue ; that is, not 
merely in the possession, but in the use/' 

Now the implied belief that virtue can be defined other- 
wise than in terms of happiness (for else the proposition is 
that happiness is to be obtained by actions conducive 
to happiness) is allied to the Platonic belief that there is 
an ideal or absolute good, which gives to particular and 
relative goods their property of goodness; and an 
argument analogous to that which Aristotle uses against 
Plato's conception of good, may be used against his own 
conception of virtue. As with good so with virtue — ^it is not 
singular but plural : in Aristotle's own classification, virtue, 
when treated of at large, is transformed into virtues. Those 
which he calls virtues, must be so called in consequence of 
some common character that is either intrinsic or extrinsic. 
We may class things together either because they are made 
alike by all having in themselves some peculiarity, as we do 
vertebrate animals because they all have vertebral columns ; 
or we may class them together because of some community in 
their outer relations, as when we group saws, knives, mallets, 
harrows, under the head of tools. Are the virtues classed as 
such because of some intrinsic community of nature? Then

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 37 

there mnst be identifiable a common trait in all tbe cardinal 
virtues which Aristotle specifies — ''Courage, Temperance, 
Liberality, Magnanimity, Magnificence, Meekness, Amiability 
or Friendliness, Truthfulness, Justice/^ What now is the trait 
possessed in common by Magnificence and Meekness ? and 
if any such common trait can be disentangled, is it that 
which also constitutes the esi^ntial trait in Truthfulness ? 
The answer must be — ^No. The virtues, then, not being classed 
as such because of an instrinsic community of character, must 
be classed as such because of something extrinsic ; and this 
something can be nothing else than the happiness which 
Aristotle says consists in the practice of them. They are 
united by their common relation to this result ; while they 
are not united by their inner natures. 

Perhaps still more clearly may the inference be drawn 
thus : — ^If virtue is primordial and independent, no reason 
can be given why there should be any correspondence 
between virtuous conduct and conduct that is pleasure- 
giving in its total effects on self, or others, or both ; and if 
there is not a necessary correspondence, it is conceivable 
that the conduct classed as virtuous should be pain-giving 
in its total effects. That we may see the consequence 
of so conceiving it, let us take the two virtues con- 
sidered as typically such in ancient times and in modern 
times — courage and chastity. By the hypothesis, then, 
courage, displayed alike in self-defence and in defence of 
country, is to be conceived as not only entailing pains 
incidentally, but as being necessarily a cause of misery to 
the individual and to the State ; while, by implication, the 
absence of it redounds to personal and general well-being. 
Similarly, by the hypothesis, we have to conceive that 
irregular sexual relations are directly and indirectly bene- 
ficial — that adultery is conducive to domestic harmony and 
the careful rearing of children ; while marital relations in 
proportion as they are persistent, generate discord between 
husband and wife and entail on their offspring, suffering.

disease, and death. Unless it is asserted that conrage and 
chastity conld still be thought of as virtues though thus pro- 
ductiye of misery^ it must be admitted that the conception of 
virtue cannot be separated from the conception of happiness- 
producing conduct; and that as this holds of aU the virtues^ 
however otherwise imlike, it is from their conduciveness to 
happiness that they come to be classed as virtues. 

§ 14. When from those ethical estimates which take 
perfection of nature, or virtuousness of action, as tests, we 
pass to those which take for test rectitude of motive, we 
approach the intuitional theory of morals; and we may 
conveniently deal with such estimates by a criticism on this 
theory. 

By the intuitional theory I here mean, not that which 
recognizes as produced by the inherited eflTects of continued 
experiences, the feelings of liking and aversion we have to 
acts of certain kinds ; but I mean the theory which regards 
such feelings as divinely given, and as independent of results 
, experienced by seK or ancestors. ^' There is therefore,^' says 
J Hutcheson, *^as each one by close attention and reflection 
may convince himseK,a natural and immediate determination 
to approve certain afiections, and actions consequent upon 
them;'' and since, in common with others of his time, ho 
believes in the special creation of man and all -other beings, 
this " natural sense of immediate excellence'' he considers as 
a supernaturally-derived guide. Though he says that the 
feelings and acts thus intuitively recognized as good, '^all 
agree in one general character, of tending to the happiness 
of others ;" yet he is obliged to conceive this as a pre-or- 
dained correspondence. Nevertheless, it may be shown that 
conduciveness to happiness, here represented as an incidental 
trait of the acts which receive these innate moral approvals^ 
is really the test by which these approvals are recognized as 
moral. The intuitionists place confidence in these verdicts 
of conscience, simply because they vaguely, if not distinctly.

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 39 

perceive them to be consonant with the disclosures of that 
ultimate teat. Observe the proof. 

By the hypothesis, the wrongness of murder is known 
by a moral intuition which the human mind was originally 
constituted to yield; and the hypothesis therefore negatives 
the admission that this sense of its wrongness arises, imme-. 
diately or remotely, from the consciousness that murder\^ 
involves deduction from happiness, directly and indirectly. 
But if you ask an adherent of this doctrine to contrast his 
intuition with that of the Fijian, who, considering murder an ^ 
honourable action, is restless until he has distinguished . 
himself by killing some one; and if you inquire of him in 
what way the civilized intuition is to be justified in 
opposition to the intuition of the savage ; no course is open 
save that of showing how conformity to the one conduces 
to well-being, while conformity to the other entails suflTering, 
individual and general. When asked why the moral 
sense which tells him that it is wrong to take another man's 
goods, should be obeyed rather than the moral sense of a 
Turcoman, who proves how meritorious he considers theft ^ 
to be by making pilgrimages to the tombs of noted robbers 
to make oflferings; the intuitionist can do nothing but 
urge that, certainly under conditions like ours, if not also 
under conditions like those of the Turcomans, disregard of 
men's claims to their property not only inflicts immediate 
misery, but involves a social state inconsistent with happiness. 
Or if, again, there is required from him a justification for 
his feeling of repugnance to lying, in contrast with 
the feeling of an Egyptian, who prides himself on skill . 
in lying (even thinking it praiseworthy to deceive without 
any further end than that of practising deception) ; he can 
do no more than point to the social prosperity furthered 
by entire trust between man and man, and the social dis- 
organization that follows universal untruthfulness — conse- 
quences that are necessarily conducive to agreeable feelings 
and disagreeable feeliugs respectively.

40 THE DATA 09 ETHICS, 

The nnayoidable conclusion is^ then, that the intnitionist 
does not^. and cannot^ ignore the ultimate derivations of 
right and wrong from pleasure and pain. However much 
he may be guided^ and rightly guided, by the decisions of 
conscience respecting the characters of acts ; he has come 
to have confidence in these decisions because he perceives^ 
vagfuely but positively, that conformity to them farthers 
the welfare of himself and others, and that disregard of 
them entails in the long run suffering on all. Require 
him to name any moral-sense judgment by which he 
knows as right, some kind of act that will bring a surplus 
of pain, taking into account the totals in this hf e and in 
any assumed other life, and you find him unable to name 
one: a fact proving that underneath all these intuitions 
respecting the goodness or badness of acts, there lies the 
fundamental assumption that acts are good or bad according 
as their aggregate effects increase men's happiness or 
increase their misery. 

§ V% It is curious to see how the devil-worship of the 
savage, surviving in various disguises among the civilized, 
and leaving as one of its products that asceticism which in 
many forms and degrees still prevails widely, is to be found 
influencing in marked ways, men who have apparently 
emancipated themselves, not only from primitive supersti- 
tions but from more developed superstitions. Views of 
life and conduct which originated with those who propitiated 
deified ancestors by self-tortures, enter even still into the 
ethical theories .of many persons who have years since cast 
away the theology of the past, and suppose themselves to be 
no longer influenced by it. 

In the writings of one who rejects dogmatic Christianity 
together with the Hebrew cult which preceded it, a career 
of conquest costing tens of thousands of lives, is narrated 
with a sympathy comparable to that rejoicing which the 
Hebrew traditions show us over destruction of enemies in

the name of God. You may find, too, a delight in contem- 
plating the exercise of despotic power, joined with insistance 
on the salutariness of a state in which the wills of slaves 
and citizens, are humbly subject to the wills of masters 
and rulers — ^a sentiment also reminding us of that ancient 
Oriental life which biblical narratives portray. Along with 
this worship of the strong man — along with this justification 
of whatever force may be needed for carrying out his 
ambition — ^along with this yearning for a form of society in 
which supremacy of the few is unrestrained and the virtue 
of the many consists in obedience to them; we not unnaturally 
find repudiation of the ethical theory which takes, in some 
shape or other, the greatest happiness as the end of conduct : 
we not unnaturally find this utilitarian philosophy designated 
by the contemptuous title of '' pig-philosophy." And then, 
serving to show what comprehension there has been of the 
philosophy so nicknamed, we are told that not happiness 
but blessedness must be the end. 

Obviously, the implication is that blessedness is not a kind 
of happiness; and this implication at once suggests the 
question — What mode of feeUng is it f * If it is a state of 
consciousness at all, it is necessarily one of three states — 
painful, indiflferent, or pleasurable. Does it leave the 
possessor at the zero point of sentiency ? Then it leaves him 
just as he would be if he had not got it. Does it not leave 
him at the zero point ? Then it must leave him below zero 
or above zero. 

Each of these possibilities may be conceived under two 
forms. That to which the term blessedness is applied, may 
be a particular atate of consciousness — one among the many 
states that occur ; and on this supposition we have to recog- 
nize it as a pleasurable state, an indifferent state, or a painful 
state. Otherwise, blessedness is a word not applicable to a 
particular state of consciousness, but characterizes the aggre- 
gate of its states; and in this case the average of the 
aggregate is to be conceived as one in which the pleasurable

42 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

predominates, or one in which the painful predominates^ or 
one in which pleasores and pains exactly cancel one another. 
Let ns take in tarn these two imaginable applications of the 
word. 

''Blessed are the merciful/' ''Blessed are the peace- 
makers /' " Blessed is he that considereth the poor;*' are 
sayings which we may fairly take as conveying the accepted 
meaning of blessedness. What now shall we say of one who 
is, for the time being, blessed in performing an act of 
mercy ? Is his mental state pleasurable ? If so the hypothesis 
is abandoned : blessedness is a particular form of happiness. 
Is the state indifferent or painful ? In that case the blessed 
man is so devoid of sympathy that relieving another from 
pain, or the fear of pain, leaves him either wholly unmoved, 
or gives him an unpleasant emotion. Again, if one who is 
blessed in making peace receives no gratification from the 
act, then seeing men injure each other does not aflfect him 
at all, or gives him a pleasure which is changed into a pain 
when he prevents the injury. Once more, to say that the 
blessedness of one who " considereth the poor '^ implies no 
agreeable feeling, is to say that his cousideration for the poor 
leaves him without feeling or entails on him a disagreeable 
feeling. So that if blessedness is a particular mode of con- 
sciousness temporarily existing as a concomitant of each kind 
of beneficent action, those who deny that it is a pleasure, 
or constituent of happiness, confess themselves either not 
pleased by the welfare of others or displeased by it. 

Otherwise understood, blessedness must, as we have seen, 
refer to the totality of feelings experienced during the life of 
one who occupies himself with the actions the word con- 
notes. This also presents the three possibilities — ^surplus lof 
pleasures, surplus of pains, equality of the two. If the 
pleasurable states are in excess, then the blessed life can be 
distinguished from any other pleasurable life only by the 
relative amount, or the quality, of its pleasures : it is a life 
which makes happiness of a certain kind and degree its end;

and the assumption that blessedness is not a form of happi- 
ness^ lapses. If the blessed life is one in which the pleasures 
and pains receiyed balance one another^ so producing an 
average that is indifferent; or if it is one in which the 
pleasures are out-balanced by the pains ; then the blessed life 
has the character which the pessimist alleges of life at large, 
and therefore regards it as cursed. Annihilation is best, he 
will argue ; since if an average that is indifferent is the out- 
come of the blessed life, annihilation at once achieves it ; 
and if a surplus of suffering is the outcome of this highest 
kind of life called blessed, still more should life in general 
be ended. 

A possible rejoiader must be named and disposed of. 
While it is admitted that the particular kind of consciousness 
accompanying conduct that is blessed, is pleasurable; it may 
be contended that pursuance of this conduct and receipt of 
the pleasure, brings by the implied self-denial, and per- 
sistent effort, and perhaps bodily injury, a suffering that 
exceeds it in amount. And it may then be urged that 
blessedness, characterized by this excess of aggregate pains 
over aggregate pleasures, should nevertheless be pursued as 
an end, rather than the happiness constituted by excess of 
pleasures over pains. But now, defensible though this 
conception of blessedness may be when limited to one indi- 
vidual, or some individuals, it becomes indefensible when 
extended to all individuals ; as it must be if blessedness is 
taken for the end of conduct. To see this we need but ask 
for what purpose are these pains in excess of pleasures to be 
borne. Blessedness being the ideal state for all persons ; 
and the self-sacrifices made by each person in pursuance 
of this ideal state, having for their end to help all other 
persons in achieving the like ideal state ; it results that the 
blessed though painful state of each, is to be acquired by 
furthering the like blessed though painful states of others : 
the blessed consciousness is to be constituted by the con- 
templation of their consciousnesses in a condition of average

suffering. Does any one accept this inference ? If not, his 
rejection of it involves the admission that the motive for 
bearing pains in performing acts called blessed, is not the 
obtaining for others like pains of blessedness, but the obtain- 
ing of pleasures for others ; and that thus pleasure somewhere 
is the tacitly-implied ultimate end. 

In brief, then, blessedness has for its necessary condition 
of existence, increased happiness, positive or negative, in 
some consciousness or other ; and disappears utterly if we 
assume that the actions called blessed, are known to cause 
decrease of happiness in others as well as in the actor. 



§ 1 j(. To make clear the meaning of the general argument 
set forth in this chapter, its successive parts must be briefly 
summarized. 

That which in the last chapter we found to be highly- 
evolved conduct, is that which, in this chapter, we find to be 
what is called good conduct; and the ideal goal to the 
natural evolution of conduct there recognized, we here 
recognize as the ideal standard of conduct ethically con- 
sidered. 

The acts adjusted to ends, which while constituting the 
outer visible Hfe from moment to moment further the con- 
tinuance of life, we saw become, as evolution progresses^ 
better adjusted; until finally they make the life of each 
individual entire in length and breadth, at the same time 
that they efficiently subserve the rearing of young, and do 
both these not only without hindering other individuals 
from doing the like, but while giving aid to them in doing 
the like. And here we see that goodness is asserted of such 
conduct under each of these three aspects. Other things 
equal, well-adjusted self-conserving acts we call good ; other 
things equal, we call good the acts that are well adjusted 
for bringing up progeny capable of complete living; and 
other things equal, we ascribe goodness to acts which 
further the complete living of others.

GOOD AND BAD CONDUCT. 45 

This judging as good, conduct wliicli conduces to life in 
eacli and all, we found to involve the assumption that 
animate existence is desirable. By the pessimist, conduct 
which subserves life cannot consistently be called good : to 
call it good implies some form of optimism. We saw, how- 
ever, that pessimists and optimists both start with the 
postulate that life is a blessing or a curse, according as the 
average consciousness accompanying it is pleasurable or 
painful. And since avowed or implied pessimists, and 
optimists of one or other shade, taken together constitute all 
men, it results that this postulate is universally accepted. 
Whence it follows that if we call good the conduct conducive *. 
to life, we can do so only with the implication that it is I 
conducive to a surplus of pleasures over pains. 

The truth that conduct is considered by us as good or 
bad, according as its aggregate results, to self or others or 
both, are pleasurable or painful, we found on examination 
to be involved in all the current judgments on conduct : the 
proof being that reversing the applications of the words 
creates absurdities. And we found that every other pro- 
posed standard of conduct derives its authority from this 
standard. Whether perfection of nature is the assigned j. 
proper aim, or virtuousness of action, or rectitude of motive, \ 
we saw that definition of the perfection, the virtue, the recti- I 
tude, inevitably brings us down to happiness experienced i 
in some form, at some time, by some person, as the funda- / 
mental idea. Nor could we discover any intelligible con- 
ception of blessedness, save one which implies a raising of 
consciousness, individual or general, to a happier state; 
either by mitigating pains or increasing pleasures. 

Even with those who judge of conduct from the religious 
point of view, rather than from the ethical point of view, it is 
the same. Men who seek to propitiate God by inflicting 
pains on themselves, or refrain from pleasures to avoid 
offending him, do so to escape greater ultimate pains or 
to get greater ultimate pleasures. If by positive or Degative

suffering here, they expected to achieve more suffering here- 
after, they would not do as they do. That which they now 
think duty they would not think duty if it promised eternal 
misery instead of eternal happiness. Nay, if there be any 
who belieye that human beings were created to be unhappy^ 
and that they ought to continue living to display their 
unhappiness for the satisfaction of their creator, such 
believers are obliged to use this standard of judgment; for 
the pleasure of their diaboUcal god is the end to be 
achieved. , 
> So that no school can avoid taking for the ultimate morah 
aim a desirable state of feeling called by wihatever name — 
gratification, enjoyment, happiuess. Pleasure somewhere, at 
some time, to some being or beings, is an inexpugnable 
element of the conception. It is as much a necessary form I 
of moral intuition as space is a necessary form of intellectual ) 
intuition.

CHAPTER IV. 

WAYS OP JUDGING CONDUCT. 

§ 17. Intellectual progress is by no one trait so ade- 
quately characterized, as by development of the idea of 
causation ; since development of this idea involves develop- 
ment of so many other ideas. Before anyway can be made, 
thought and language must have advanced far enough to 
render properties or attributes thinkable as such, apart from 
objects; which, in low stages of human intelligence, they are 
not. Again, even the simplest notion of cause, as we under- 
stand it, can be reached only after many like instances have 
been grouped into a simple generalization ; and through all 
ascending steps, higher notions of causation imply wider 
notions of generality. Further, as there must be clustered 
in the mind, concrete causes of many kinds before there can 
emerge the conception of cause, apart from particular causes; 
it follows that progress in abstractness of thought is implied. 
Concomitantly, there is implied the recognition of constant 
relations among phenomena, generating ideas of uniformity 
of sequence and of co-existence — the idea of natural law. 
These advances can go on only as fast as perceptions and 
resulting thoughts, are made definite by the use of measures; 
serving to familarize the mind with exact correspondence, 
truth, certainty. And only when growing science accumulates 
examples of quantitative relations, foreseen and verified, 
throughout a widening range of phenomena,, does causation

48 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

come to be conceived as necessary and universal. So that 
thougli all these cardinal conceptions aid one another in 
developing, we may properly say that the conception of 
causation especially depends for its development on the 
developments of the rest ; and therefore is the best measure 
of intellectual development at large. 

How slowly, as a consequence of its dependence, the 
conception of causation evolves, a glance at the evidence 
shows. We hear with surprise of the savage who, falling 
down a precipice, ascribes the failure of his foothold to a 
malicious demon ; and we smile at the kindred notion of the 
ancient Greek, that his death was prevented by a goddess 
who unfastened for him the thong of the helmet by which 
his enemy was dragging him. But daily, without surprise, 
we hear men who describe themselves as saved from ship- 
wreck by "divine interposition,^^ who speak of having 
"providentially'^ missed a train which met with a fatal 
disaster, and who call it a '^ mercy '' to have escaped injury 
from a falling chimney-pot — men who, in such cases, 
recognize physical causation no more than do the uncivilized 
or semi-civilized. The Veddah who thinks that failure to 
hit an animal with his arrow, resulted from inadequate 
invocation of an ancestral spirit, and the Christian priest who 
says prayers over a sick man in the expectation that the 
course of his disease will so be stayed, differ only in respect 
of the agent from whom they expect supernatural aid and 
the phenomena to be altered by him : the necessary relations 
among causes and effects are tacitly ignored by the last as 
much as by the first. Deficient belief in causation is, indeed, 
exemplified even in those whose discipline has been specially 
fitted to generate this belief — even in men of science. For 
a generation after geologists had become uniformitarians 
in Greology, they remained catastrophists in Biology : while 
recognizing none but natural agencies in the genesis of the 
Earth's crust, they ascribed to supernatural agency the 
genesis of the organisms on its surface. Nay more — among

WAYS OP JUDGINa CONDUCT. 49 

those who are convinced that living things in general 
have been evolved by the continued inter-action of forces 
everywhere operating, there are some who make an excep- 
tion of man ; or who, if they admit that his body has been 
evolved in the same manner as the bodies of other creatures, 
allege that his mind has been not evolved but specially 
created. If, then, universal and necessary causation is only 
now approaching full recognition, even by those whose 
investigations are daily re-illustrating it, we may expect to 
find it very little recognized among men at large, whose 
culture has not been calculated to impress them with it ; 
and we may expect to find it least recognized by them in 
respect of those classes of phenomena amid which, in 
consequence of their complexity, causation is most difficult 
to trace — ^the psychical, the social, the moral. 

Why do I here make these reflections on what seems an 
irrelevant subject ? I do it because on studying the various 
ethical theories, I am struck with the fact that they are all 
characterized either by entire absence of the idea of 
causation, or by inadequate presence of it. Whether 
theological, political, intuitional, or utilitarian, they all 
display, if not in the same degree, still, each in a large 
degree, the defects which result from this lack. We will 
consider them in the order named. 

§ 18. The school of morals properly to be considered as 
the still-extant representative of the most ancient school, is 
that which recognizes no other rule of conduct than the 
alleged wi,ll of God. It originates with the savage whose 
only restraint beyond fear of his fellow man, is fear of an 
ancestral spirit ; and whose notion of moral duty as dis- 
tinguished from his notion of social prudence, arises from 
this fear. Here the ethical doctrine and the religious 
doctrine are identical — ^have in no degree differentiated. 

This primitive form of ethical doctrine, changed only by 
the gradual dying out of multitudinous minor supernatural

agents and accompanying development of one universal 
supernatural agent, survives in great strength down to our own 
day. Religious creeds, established and dissenting, all embody 
the belief that right and wrong are right and wrong simply in 
virtue of divine enactment. And this tacit assumption has 
passed from systems of theology into systems of morality; or 
rather, let us say that moral systems in early stages of 
development, little differentiated from the accompanying 
theological systems, have participated in this assumption. 
We see this in the works of the Stoics, as well as in the 
works of certain Christian moralists. Among recent ones 
I may instance the Essays on the Principles of Morality , by 
Jonathan Dymond, a Quaker, which makes ''the authority 
of the Deity the sole ground of duty, and His communicated 
will the only ultimate standard of right and wrong.^^ Nor 
is it by writers belonging to so relatively unphilosophical a 
sect only, that this view is held ; it is held with a difiEerence 
by writers belonging to sects contrariwise distinguished. 
For these assert that in the absence of belief in a deity, 
there would be no moral guidance; and this amounts to 
asserting that moral truths have no other origin than the 
will of God, which, if not considered as revealed in sacred 
writings, must be considered as revealed in conscience. 

This assumption when examined, proves to be suicidal. 
If there are no other origins for right and wrong than this 
enunciated or intuited divine will, then, as alleged, were 
there no knowledge of the divine will, the acts now known as 
wrong would not be known as wrong. But if men did not 
know such acts to be wrong because contrary to the divine 
will, and so, in committing them, did not offend by disobe- 
dience; and if they could not otherwise know them to be 
wrong ; then they might commit them indifferently with the 
acts now classed as right: the results, practically considered, 
Would be the same. In so far as secular matters are 
concerned, there would be no difference between the two; 
for to say that in the affairs of life, any evils would arise

WAYS OF JUDGING CONDUCT. 51 

from continuing to do tho acts called wrong and ceasing 
to do the acts called right, is to say that these produce in 
themselves certain mischievous consequences and certain 
beneficial consequences; which is to say there is another 
source for moral rules than the revealed or inferred divine 
will: they may be established by induction from these 
-observed consequences. 

From this implication I see no escape. It must be either 
admitted or denied that the acts called good and the acts 
called bad, naturally conduce, the one to human well-being 
and the other to human ill-being. Is it admitted ? Then 
the admission amounts to an assertion that the conduciveness 
is shown by experience ; and this involves abandonment 
-of the doctrine that there is no origin for morals apart from 
divine injunctions. , Is it denied that acts classed as good 
and bad differ in their effects ? Then it is tacitly affirmed 
that human affairs would go on just as well in ignorance of 
the distinction; and the alleged need for commandments 
from God disappears. 

And here we see how entirely wanting is the conception 
of cause. This notion that such and such actions are made 
respectively good and bad simply by divine injunction, is 
tantamount to the notion that such and such actions have 
not in the nature of things such and such kinds of effects. 
If there is not an unconsciousness of causation there is an 
ignoring of it. 

§ 19. Following Plato and Aristotle, who make State- 
enactments the sources of right and wrong ; and following 
flobbes, who holds that there can be neither justice nor 
injustice till a regularly-constituted coercive power exists to 
issue and enforce commands; not a few modern thinkers 
hold that there is no other origin for good and bad in 
conduct than law. And this implies the belief that moral 
obligation originates with Acts of Parliament, and can be 
<jhanged this way or that way by majorities. They ridicule

52 THB DATA OF ETHICS. 

the idea tliat men have any natural rights, and allege that 
rights are wholly results of convention: the necessary 
implication being that duties are so too. Before considering 
whether this theory coheres with outside truths, let ua 
observe how far it is coherent within itself. 

In pursuance of his argument that rights audi duties 
originate with established social arrangements^ Hobbes^ 



** Where no coYcnant hath preceded, there hath no right been transferred, and 
every man has right to eyery thing; and consequently, no action can be nnjost. 
Bnt when a covenant is made, then to break it is unjttsb ; and the definition of 
INJUSTICE, is no other than the not performance of covenomt. And whatsoever 
is not unjust, is jiLst. . . . Therefore before the names of just and unjust can 
have place, there must be some coercive power, to compel men equally to the 
performance of their covenants, by the terror of some pnnishment, greater 
than the benefit they expect by the breach of their covenant/'* 

In this paragraph the essential propositions are : — justice 
is fulfilment of covenant ;xfulfilment of covenant implies a 
power enforcing it: ^^just and unjust can have no place '' 
unless men are compelled to perform their covenants. But 
this is to say that men cannot perform their covenants without 
compulsion. Grant that justice is performance of covenant. 
Now suppose it to be performed voluntarily : there is justice. 
In such case, however, there is justice in the absence of 
coercion ; which is contrary to the hypothesis. The only con- 
ceivable rejoinder is an absurd one : — voluntary perform- 
ance of covenant is impossible. Assert this, and the doctrine 
that right and wrong come into existence with the establish- 
ment of sovereignty is defensible. Decline to assert it, and 
the doctrine vanishes. 

From inner incongruities pass now to outer ones. The 
justification for his doctrine of absolute civil authority as 
the source of rules of conduct, Hobbes seeks in the miseries 
entailed by the chronic war between man and man which must 
exist in the absence of society ; holding that under any kind 
of government a better life is possible than in the state of 

♦ Leviathan, ch. xv.

WAYS OF JUDGING CONDUCT. 53 

nature. Now whether we accept the gratuitous and baseless 
theory that men surrendered their liberties to a sovereign 
power of some kind, with a view to the promised increase 
of satisfactions ; or whether we accept the rational theory, 
inductively based, that a state of political subordination 
gradually became established through experience of the 
increased satisfactions derived under it ; it equally remains 
obvious that the acts of the sovereign power have no other 
warrant than their subservience to the purpose for which 
it came into existence. The necessities which initiate 
government, themselves prescribe the actions of govern- 
ment. If its actions do not respond to the necessities, they 
xire unwarranted. The authority of law is, then, by the 
hypothesis, derived; and can never transcend the authority 
of that from which it is derived. If general good, or 
welfare, or utility, is the supreme end ; and if State-enact- 
ments are justified as means to this supreme end; then. 
State-enactments have such authority only as arises from 
oonduciveness to this supreme end. When they are right, 
it is only because the original authority endorses them; 
And they are wrong if they do not bear its endorsement. 
That is to say, conduct cannot be made good or bad by law ; 
but its goodness or badness is to the last determined by its 
effects as naturally furthering, or not furthering, the lives 
of citizens. 

Still more when considered in the concrete, than when 
considered in the abstract, do th« views of Hobbes and his 
disciples prove to be inconsistent. Joining in the general 
belief that without such security for life as enables men to 
go fearlessly about their business, there can be neither 
happiness nor prosperity, individual or general, they agree 
that measures for preventifig murder, manslaughter, assault, • 
&c,y are requisite; and they advocate this or that penal 
system as furnishmg the best deterrents : so arguing, both 
in respect of the evils and the remedies, that such and such 
causes will, by the nature of things, produce such and such 



DigitizecLby VjOOQIC 



54 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

effects. They recognize as inferable a p7'ion, the trutli that 
men will not lay by property unless they can count with 
great probability on reaping advantages from it; that 
consequently where robbery is unchecked, or where a 
rapacious ruler appropriates whatever earnings his subjects 
do not effectually hide, production will scarcely exceed 
immediate consumption; and that necessarily there will 
be none of that accumulation of capital required for 
social development, with all its aids to welfare. In neither 
case, however, do they perceive that they are tacitly assert- 
ing the need for certain restraints on conduct as deducible 
from the necessary conditions to complete life in the social 
state ; and are so making the authority of law derivative 
and not original. 

If it be said by any belonging to this school, that certain 
moral obligations to be distinguished as cardinal, must be 
admitted to have a basis deeper than legislation, and that it 
is for legislation not to create but merely to enforce them — 
if, I say, admitting this, they go on to allege a legislative 
origin for minor claims and duties; then we have the 
implication that whereas some kinds of conduct do, in the 
nature of things, tend to work out certain kinds of results, 
other kinds of conduct do not, in the nature of things, tend 
to work out certain kinds of results. While of these acts 
the naturally good or bad consequences must be allowed, it 
may be denied of those acts that they have naturally good 
or bad consequences. Only after asserting this can it be 
consistently asserted that acts of the last class are made right 
or wrong by law. For if such acts have any intrinsic 
tendencies to produce beneficial or mischievous eflFects^ then 
these intrinsic tendencies furnish the warrant for legislative 
requirements or interdicts; and to say that the requirement* 
or interdicts make 'them right or wrong, is to say that they 
have no intrinsic tendencies to produce beneficial or 
mischievous efiects. 

Here, then, we have another theory betraying deficient

WAYS OF JUDGING CONDUCT. 55 

consciousness of causation. An adequate consciousness of 
causation yields the irresistible belief that from the most 
serious to the most trivial actions of men in society, there 
must flow consequences which, quite apart from legal 
agency, conduce to well-being or ill-being in greater or 
smaller degrees. If murders are socially injurious whether 
forbidden by law or not — ^if one man's appropriation of 
another's gains by force, brings special and general evils, 
whether it is or is not contrary to a ruler's edicts — ^if non- 
fulfilment of contract, if cheating, if adulteration, work mis- 
chiefs on a community in proportion as they are common, 
quite irrespective of prohibitions; then, is it not manifest 
that the like holds throughout all the details of men's 
behaviour ? Is it not clear that when legislation insists on 
certain acts which have naturally beneficial efiects, and forbids 
others that have naturally injurious effects, the acts are not 
made good or bad by legislatioK j but the legislation derives its 
authority from the natural efiects of the acts ? Non-recogni- 
tion of this implies non-recognition of natural causation. 

§ 20. Nor is it otherwise with the pure intuitionists, who 
hold that moral perceptions are innate in the original 
sense — ^thinkers whose view is that men have been divinely 
endowed with moral faculties; not that these have re- 
sulted from inherited modifications caused by accumulated 
experiences. 

To affirm that we know some things to be right and 
other things to be wrong, by virtue of a supernaturally- 
given conscience; and thus tacitly to aflirm that we do not 
otherwise know right from wrong ; is tacitly to deny any 
natural relations between acts and results. For if there 
exist any such relations, then we may ascertain by induction, 
or deduction, or both, what these are. And if it be admitted 
that because of such natural relations, happiness is produced 
by this kind of conduct, which is therefore to be approved, 
while misery is produced by that kind of conduct, which is

56 THE DATA Oft ETHICS. 

therefore to be condemned; then it is admitted that the 
rightness or wrongness of actions are determinable, and 
mnst finally be determined, by the goodness or badness of 
the eflFects that flow from them ; which is contrary to the 
hypothesis. 

It may, indeed, be rejoined that efiects are deliberately 
ignored by this school; which teaches that conrses recognized 
by moral intuition as right, must be pursued without regard 
to consequences. But on inquiry it turns out that the conse- 
quences to be disregarded are particular consequences, and 
not . general consequences. When, for example, it is said 
that property lost by another ought to be restored irrespec- 
tive of evil to the finder, who possibly may, by restoring it, 
lose that which would have preserved him from starvation ; 
it is meant that in pursuance of the principle, the immediate 
and special consequences must be disregarded, not the 
diflFused and remote consequences. By which we are shown 
that though the theory forbids overt recognition of causation 
there is an unavowed recognition of it. 

And this implies the trait to which I am drawing attention. 
The conception of natural causation is so imperfectly 
developed, that there is only an indistinct consciousness 
that throughout the whole of human conduct, necessary 
relations of causes and effects prevail ; and that from them 
are ultimately derived all moral rules, however much these 
may be proximately derived from moral intuitions. /^ 

§ 21. Strange to say, even the utilitarian school, which, at 
first sight, appears to be distinguished from the rest by 
recognizing natural causation, is, if not so far from complete 
recognition of it, yet very far. 

Conduct, according to its theory, is to be estimated by 
observation of results. When, in sufficiently numerous cases, 
it has been found that behaviour of this kind works evil 
while behaviour of that kind works good, these kinds of 
behaviour are to be judged as wrong and right respectively.

Now though it seems that the origin of moral rules in natural 
causes, is thus asserted by implication, it is but partially 
asserted. The implication is simply that we are to ascertain 
by induction that such and such mischiefs or benefits do 
go along with such and such acts; and are then to infer 
that the like relations will hold in future. But acceptance 
of these generalizations and the inferences from them, does 
not amount to recognition of causation in the full sense of 
the word. So long as only some relation between cause and 
effect in conduct is recognized, and not the relation, a 
completely-scientific form of knowledge has not been 
reached. At present, utilitarians pay no attention to this 
distinction. Even when it is pointed out, they disregard the 
fact that empirical utilitarianism is but a transitional form 
to be passed through on the way to rational utilitarianism. 
In a letter to Mr. Mill, written some sixteen years ago, 
repudiating the title anti-utilitarian which he had applied to 
me (a letter subsequently published in Mr. Bain^s work on 
Mental and Moral Science) j I endeavoured to make clear the 
difference above indicated ; and I must here quote certain 
passages from that letter. 

The view for which I contend is, that Morality properly so-called — the 
science of right conduct — has for its object to determine how and why certain 
modes of condnct are detrimental, and certain others modes beneficial. These 
good and bad results cannot be accidental, but must be necessary consequences 
pf the constitution of things ; and I conceive it to be the business of Moral 
Science to deduce, from the laws of life and the conditions of existence, what 
Xinds of action necessarily tend to produce happiness, and what kinds to 
produce nnhappiness. Having done this, its deductions are to be recognized as 
laws of conduct ; and are to be conformed to irrespective of a direct estimation 
of happiness or misery. 

Perhaps an analogy will most clearly show my meaning. During its early 
stages, planetary Astronomy consisted of nothing more than accumulated 
observations respecting the positions and motions of the sun and planets ; from 
which accumulated observations it came by and by to be empirically predicted, 
with an approach to truth, that certain of the heavenly bodies would have 
icertain positions at certain times. But the modem science of planetary 
Astronomy consists of deductions from the law of gravitation^eductions 
showing why the celestial bodies necessarily occupy certain places at certain 
times. JSiow, the kind of relation which thus exists between ancient and 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



68 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

modem Astronomy, is analogous to the kind of relatioa which, I conceiye^ 
exists between the Expendiency-Morality and Moral Science properly so 
called. And the objection which I have to the current Utilitarianism is, that 
it recognizes no more developed form of Morality — does not see that it ha» 
reached but the initial stage of Moral Science. 

Doubtless if utiKtarians are asked whether ifc can be by- 
mere chance that this kind of action works evil and that 
works good, they will answer — No : they will admit that such 
sequences are parts of a necessary order among phenomena. 
But though this truth is beyond question ; and though if 
there' are causal relations between acts and their results, 
rules of conduct can become scientific only when they are 
deduced from these causal relations ; there continues to be 
entire satisfaction with that form of utilitarianism in which 
these causal relations are practically ignored. It is supposed 
that in future, as now, utility is to be determined only by 
observation of results ; and that there is no possibility of 
knowing by deduction from fundamental principles, what 
conduct must be detrimental and what conduct must be 
beneficial. 

§22>To make more specific that conception of ethical 
science here indicated, let me present it under a concrete 
aspect; beginning with a simple illustration and compli- 
cating this illustration by successive steps. 

If, by tying its main artery, we stop most of the blood 
going to a limb, then, for as long as the limb performs its 
function, those parts . which are called into play must be 
wasted faster than they are repaired: whence eventual 
disablement. The relation between due receipt of nutritive 
matters through its arteries, and due discharge of its duties 
by the limb, is a part of the physical order. If, instead of 
cutting off the supply to a particular limb, we bleed the 
patient largely, so drafting away the materials needed for 
repairing not one limb but all limbs, and not limbs only but 
viscera, there results both a muscular debility and an 
enfeeblement of the vital functions. Here, again, cause and

effect are necessarily related. The miscliief that results from 
great depletion, results apart from any divine command, or 
political enactment, or moral intuition. Now advance a step. 
Suppose the man to be prevented from taking in enough of 
the solid and liquid food containing those substances con- 
tinually abstracted from his blood in repairing his tissues : 
suppose he has cancer of the oesophagus and cannot swallow 
— what happens ? By this indirect depletion, as by direct 
depletion, he is inevitably made incapable of performing the 
actions of one in health. In this case, as in the other cases, 
the connexion between cause and eflRect is one that cannot 
be established, or altered, by any authority external to the- 
phenomena themselves. Again, let us say that instead of 
being stopped after passing his mouth, that which he would 
swallow is stopped before reaching his mouth ; so that day 
after day the man is required to waste his tissues in getting 
food, and day after day the food he has got to meet this waste, 
he is forcibly prevented from eating. As before, the progi'ess- 
towards death by starvation is inevitable — the connexion 
between acts and eflTects is independent of any alleged theo- 
logical or political authority. And similarly if, being forced 
by the whip to labour, no adequate return in food is supplied 
to him, there are equally certain evils, equally indepen- 
dent of sacred or secular enactment. Pass now 
to those actions more commonly thought of as the occa- 
sions for rules of conduct. Let us assume the man to. 
be continually robbed of that which was given him in 
exchange for his labour, and by which he was to make up 
for nervo-muscular expenditure and renew his powers. No 
less than before is the connexion between conduct and. 
consequence rooted in the constitution of things ; unchange- 
able by State-made law, and not needing establishment by 
empirical generalization. If the action by which the man is 
affected is a stage further away from the results, or produces 
results of a less decisive kind, still we see the same basis for 
morality in the physical order. Imagine that payment for

his services is made partly in bad coin ; or that it is delayed 
beyond the date agreed upon ; or that what he buys to eat 
is adulterated with innutritive matter. Manifestly, by any 
of these deeds which we condemn as unjust, and which are 
punished by law, there is, as before, an interference with 
the normal adjustment of physiological repair to physiolo- 
gical waste. Nor is it otherwise when we pass to kinds of 
-conduct still more remotely operative. If he is hindered 
from enforcing his claim — if class-predominance prevents 
him from proceeding, or if a bribed judge gives a verdict 
contrary to evidence, or if a witness swears falsely ; have not 
these deeds, though they aflFect him more indirectly, the 
same original cause for their wrongness ? Even 

with actions which work diffused and indefinite mischiefs 
it is the same. Suppose that the man, instead of being 
dealt with fraudulently, is calumniated. There is, as 
before, a hindrance to the carrying on of life-sustaining 
activities ; for the loss of character detrimentally aflTects his 
business. Nor is this all. The mental depression caused 
partially incapacitates him for energetic activity, and perhaps 
brings on ill-health. So that maliciously or carelessly pro- 
pagating false statements, tends both to diminish his life 
and to diminish his ability to maintain life. Hence its 
flagitiousness. Moreover, if we trace to their ultimate 

ramifications the effects wrought by any of these acts 
which morality called intuitive reprobates — if we ask what 
results not to the individual himself only, but also to his 
belongings — if we observe how impoverishment hinders the 
rearing of his children, by entailing under-feeding or inade- 
quate clothing, resulting perhaps in the death of some and 
the constitutional injury of others ; we see that by the neces- 
sary connexions of things these acts, besides tending primarily 
i,o lower the life of the individual aggressed upon, tend, 
secondarily, to lower the lives of all his family, and, thirdly 
io lower the life of society at large; which is damaged by 
whatever damages its units.

A more distinct meaning will now be seen in the state- 
ment that the utilitarianism which recognizes only the 
principles of conduct reached by induction, is but preparatory 
to the utilitarianism which deduces these principles from the 
processes of life as carried on under established conditions- 
of existence. 

§ 22)^ Thus, then, is justified the allegation made at the^ 
outset, that, irrespective of their distinctive characters and 
their special tendencies, all the current methods of ethics 
have one general defect — ^they neglect ultimate causal con- 
nexions. Of course I do not mean that they wholly ignore 
the natural consequences of actions ; but I mean that they 
recognize them only incidentally. They do not erect into Br 
method the ascertaining of necessary relations between causes 
and effects, and deducing rules (rf conduct from formulated 
statements of them. 

Every science begins by accumulating observations, and 
presently generalizes these empirically j but only when it 
reaches the stage at which its empirical generalizations 
are included in a rational generalization, does it become 
developed science. Astronomy has already passed through its 
successive stages : first collections of facts ; then inductions 
from them ; and lastly deductive interpretations of these, as 
corollaries from a universal principle of action among masses 
in space. Accounts of structures and tabulations of strata, 
grouped and compared, have led gradually to the assigning 
of various classes of geological changes to igneous and 
aqueous actions ; and it is now tacitly admitted that Geology 
becomes a science proper, only as fast as such changes are 
explained in terms of those natural processes which have 
arisen in the cooling and solidif3dng Earth, exposed to the 
Sun's heat and the action of the Moon upon its ocean. The 
science of life has been, and is still, exhibiting a like series 
of steps: the evolution of organic forms at large, is 
being aflSliated on physical actions in operation from tho

beginning; and the vital phenomena each organism 
presents, are coming to be understood as connected sets of 
changes, in parts formed of matters that are affected by 
certain forces and disengage other forces. So is it with 
mind. Early ideas concerning thought and feeling ignored 
everything like cause, save in recognizing those effects of 
habit which were forced on men's attention and expressed 
in proverbs; but there are growing up interpretations of 
thought and feeling as correlates of the actions and re-actions 
of a nervous structure, that is influenced by outer changes 
and works in the body adapted changes : the implication 
being that Psychology becomes a science, as fast as these 
relations of phenomena are explained as consequences of 
ultimate principles. Sociology, too, represented down to 
recent times only by stray ideas about social organization, 
scattered through the masses of worthless gossip furnished 
us by historians, is coming to be recognized by some 
as also a science; and such adumbrations of it as have 
from time to time appeared in the shape of empirical 
generalizations, are now beginning to assume the character 
of generalizations made coherent by derivation from causes 
lying in human nature placed under given conditions. 
Clearly then, Ethics, which is a science dealing with the 
conduct of associated human beings, regarded under one of 
its aspects, has to undergo a like transformation ; and, at 
present undeveloped, can be considered a developed science 
only when it has undergone this transformation. 

Ai preparation in the simpler sciences is pre-supposed. 
Ethics has a physical aspect ; since it treats of human 
activities which, in common with all expenditures of energy, 
conform to the law of the persistence of energy : moral 
principles must conform to physical necessities. It has a 
biological aspect ; since it concerns certain effects, inner and 
outer, individual and social, of the vital changes going on 
in the highest type of animal. It has a psychological 
aspect; for its subject-matter is an aggregate of actions

WAYS OP JUDGINQ CONDUCT. 63 

ihat are prompted by feelings and guided by intelligence. 
And it has a sociological aspect; for these actions, some of 
them directly and all of them indirectly, aflfect associated 
beings. 

What is the implication ? Belonging under one aspect to 
^ach of these sciences — physical, biological, psychological, 
sociological, — it can find its ultimate interpretations only 
in those fundamental truths which are common to all of them. 
Already we have concluded in a general way that conduct at 
large, including the conduct Ethics deals with, is to be fully 
understood only as an aspect of evolving life ; and now we 
^re brought to this conclusion in a more special way. 

§ 23. Here, then, we have to enter on the consideration 
of moral phenomena as phenomena of evolution; being 
forced to do this by finding that they form a part of the 
aggregate of phenomena which evolution has wrought out. 
If the entire visible universe has been evolved — if the solar 
fiystem as a whole/ the earth as a part of it, the life in 
general which the earth bears, as well as that of each 
individual organism — ^if the mental phenomena displayed 
by all creatures, up to the highest, in common with the 
phenomena presented by aggregates of these highest — if one 
and all conform to the laws of evolution ; then the necessary 
implication is that those phenomena of conduct in these 
highest creatures with which Morality is concerned, also 
xjonform. 

The preceding volumes have prepared the way for dealing 
with morals as thus conceived. Utilizing the conclusions 
they contain, let us now observe what data are furnished 
by these. We will take in succession — the physical view, 
the biological view, the psychological view, and the socio- 
logical view.

CHAPTER V. 

THE PHYSICAL VIEW. 

§ 24. Every moment we pass instantly from men'si 
perceived actions to the motives implied by them; and 
so are led to formulate these actions in mental term& 
rather than in bodily terms. Thoughts and feelings are 
referred to when we speak of any one's deeds with praise 
or blame ; not those outer manifestations which reveal the 
thoughts and feelings. Hence we become oblivious of the 
truth that conduct as actually experienced^ consists of 
changes recognized by touch, sight and hearing. 

This habit of contemplating only the psychical fe*ce of 
conduct, is so confirmed that an effort is required to con- 
template only the physical face. Undeniable as it is that 
another's behaviour to us is made up of movements of his 
body and limbs, of his facial muscles, and of his vocal 
apparatus ; it yet seems paradoxical to say that these are the 
only elements of conduct really known by us, while the 
elements of conduct which we exclusively think of as 
constituting it, are not known but inferred. 

Here, however, ignoring for the time being the inferred 
elements in conduct, we have to deal with the perceived 
elements — we have to observe its traits considered as a 
set of combined motions. Taking the evolution point of 
view, and remembering that while an aggregate evolves, not 
only the matter composing it, but also the motion of that 



Digitized b^GoOgle 



THE PHYSICAL VIEW. 65 

matter^ passes from an indefiiiite incoherent homogeneity 
to a definite coherent heterogeneity, we have now to ask 
whether conduct as it rises to its higher forms, displays in 
increasing degrees these characters ; and whether it does not 
display them in the greatest degree when it reaches that 
highest form which we call moral. 

§ 25. It will be convenient to deal first with the trait of 
increasing coherence. The conduct of lowly-organized 
creatures is broadly contrasted with the conduct of highly- 
organized creatures, in having its successive portions feebly 
connected. The random movements which an animalcule 
makes, have severally no reference to movements made a 
moment before; nor do they affect in specific ways the 
movements made immediately after. To-day's wanderings 
of a fish in search of food, though perhaps showing by 
their adjustments to catching different kinds of prey at 
different hours, a slightly-determined order, are unrelated to 
the wanderings of yesterday and to-morrow. But such more 
developed creatures as birds, show us in the building of 
nests, the sitting on eggs, the rearing of chicks, and the 
aiding of them after they fly, sets of motions which form a 
dependent series extending over a considerable period. 
And on observing the complexity of the acts performed 
in fetching and fixing the fibres of the nest or in catching 
and bringing to the young each portion of food, we dis- 
cover in the combined motions, lateral cohesion as well as 
longitudinal cohesion. 

Man, even in his lowest state, displays in his conduct far 
more coherent combinations of motions. By the elaborate 
manipulations gone through in making weapons that are to 
serve for the chase next year, or in building canoes and 
wigwams for permanent uses — by acts of aggression and 
defence which are connected with injuries long since 
received or committed, the savage exhibits an aggregate 
of motions which, in some of its parts, holds together 

5

66 THE DATA 07 ETHICS. 

over great periods. Moreover, if we consider the many 
movements implied by the transactions of each day, in 
the wood, on the water, in the camp, in the family; we 
see that this coherent aggregate of movements is composed 
of many minor aggregates, that are severally coherent 
within themselves and with one another. In 

civilized man this trait of developed conduct becomes 
more conspicuous still. Be his business what it may, its 
processes involve relatively-numerous dependent motions; 
and day by day it is so carried on as to show connexions 
between present motions and motions long gone by, as well 
as motions anticipated in the distant future. Besides the 
many doings, related to one another, which the farmer 
goes through in looking after his cattle, directing his 
labourers, keeping an eye on his dairy, buying his imple- 
ments, selling his produce, &c., the business of getting his 
lease involves numerous combined movements on which the 
movements of subsequent years depend ; and in manuring 
his fields with a view to larger returns, or putting down 
drains with the like motive, he is performing acts which 
are parts of a coherent combination relatively extensive. 
That the like holds of the shopkeeper, manufacturer, banker, 
is manifest. And this increased coherence of conduct among 
the civilized, will strike us. even more when we remember 
how its parts are often continued in a connected arrangement 
through life, for the purpose of making a fortune, found- 
ing a family, gaining a seat in Parliament. 

Now mark that a greater coherence among its component 
motions, broadly distinguishes the conduct we call moral 
from the conduct we call immoral. The application of the 
word dissolute to the last, and of the word self-restrained to 
the first, implies this — ^implies that conduct of the lower 
kind, constituted of disorderly acts, has its parts relatively 
loose in their relations with one another; while conduct 
of the higher kind, habitually following a fixed ordier, so 
gains a characteristic unity and coherence. In proportion

THE PHYSICAL VIEW. 67 

as the conduct is what we call morale it exhibits com- 
paratively settled connexions between antecedents and 
consequents ; for the doing, right implies that under given 
conditions the combined motions constituting conduct will 
follow in a way that can be specified. Contrariwise, in the 
conduct of one whose principles are not high, the sequences 
of motions are doubtful. He may pay the money or he may 
not; he may keep his appointment or he may fail; he may 
tell the truth or he may lie. The words trustworthiness and 
untrustworthiness, as used to characterize the two respec- 
tively, suflSciently imply that the actions of the one can be 
foreknown while those of the other can not ; and this implies 
that the successive movements composing the one bear 
more constant relations to one another than do those com- 
posing the other— are more coherent. 

§ 26. Indefiniteness accompanies incoherence in conduct 
that is little evolved ; and throughout the ascending stages 
of evolving conduct, there is an increasingly-definite co- 
ordination of the motions constituting it. 

Such changes of form as the rudest protozoj; show us, are 
utterly vague — admit of no precise description ; and though 
in higher kinds the movements of the parts are more 
definable, yet the movement of the whole in respect of 
direction is indeterminate : there is no adjustment of it 
to this or the other point in space. In such coelenterate 
animals as polypes, we see the parts moving in ways which 
lack precision ; and in one of the locomotive forms, as a 
medusa, the course taken, otherwise at random, can be 
described only as one which carries it towards the light, 
where degrees of light and darkness are present. Among 
annulose creatures the contrast between the track of a worm, 
turning this way or that at hazard, and the definite course 
taken by a bee in its flight from flower to flower or back 
to the hive, shows us the same thing: the bee's acts in 
building cells and feeding larvae further exhibiting pre-

68 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

dsion in the sunnltaneoas movements as well as in tlie 
snccessiye movements. Though the motions made by a 
fish in pursuing its prey have considerable definiteness^ 
yet they are of a simple kind, and are in this respect con- 
trasted with the many definite motions of body, head, and 
limbs gone through by a carnivorous mammal in the 
course of waylaying, running down, and seizing a herbivore; 
and further, the fish shows us none of those definitely- 
adjusted sets of motions which in the mammal subserve 
ihe rearing of young. 

Much greater definiteness, if not in the combined move- 
ments forming single acts, still in the adjustments of many 
combined acts to various purposes, characterizes human 
conduct, even in its lowest stages. In making and using 
weapons and in the manoeuvrings of savage warfare, numer- 
ous movements all precise in their adaptations to proximate 
ends, are arranged for the achievement of remote ends, 
with a precision not paralleled among lower creatures. 
The lives of civilized men exhibit this trait fer more 
conspicuously. Each industrial art exemplifies the effects 
of movements which are severally definite ; and which are 
definitely arranged in simultaneous and successive order. 
Business transactions of every kind are characterized by 
exact relations between the sets of motions constituting 
acts, and the purposes fulfilled, in time, place, and quantity. 
Further, the daily routine of each person shows us in its 
periods and amounts of activity, of rest, of releixation, 
a measured arrangement which is not shown us by the 
doings of the wandering savage ; who has no fixed times 
for hunting, sleeping, feeding, or any one kind of action. 

Moral conduct diSers from immoral conduct in the same 
manner and in a like degree.. The conscientious man is 
exact in all his transactions. He supplies a precise weight 
for a specified sum; he gives a definite quality in 
fulfilment of understanding; he pays the full amount he 
bargained to do. In times as well as in quantities, his acts

THE PHYSICAL VIEW. 69 

answer completely to anticipations. If lie has made a 
business contract lie is to the day ; if an appointment lie 
is to the minute. Similarly in respect of truth: his 
statements correspond accurately with the facts. It is thus 
too in his family life. He maintains marital relations that 
are definite in contrast with the relations that result from 
breach of the marriage contract; and as a father, fitting 
his behaviour with care to the nature of each child and to 
the occasion, he avoids the too much and the too little of 
praise or blame, reward or penalty. Nor is it otherwise 
in his miscellaneous acts. To say that he deals equitably 
with those he employs, whether they behave well or ill, is 
to say that he adjusts his acts to their deserts ; and to 
say that he is judicious in his charities, is to say that 
he portions out his aid with discrimination instead of 
distributing it indiscriminately to good and bad, as do 
those who have no adequate sense of their social respon- 
sibilities. 

That progress towards rectitude of conduct is progress 
towards duly-proportioned conduct, and that duly-pro- 
portioned conduct is relatively definite, we may see 
from another point of view. One of the traits of conduct 
we call immoral, is excess; while moderation habitually 
characterizes moral conduct. Now excesses imply extreme 
divergences of actions from some medium, while maintenance 
of the medium is implied by moderation ; whence it follows 
that actions of the last kind can be defined more nearly 
than those of the first. Clearly conduct which, being unre- 
strained, runs into great and incalculable oscillations, therein 
differs from restrained conduct of which, by implication, 
the oscillations fall within narrower limits. And falling 
within narrower limits necessitates relative definiteness of 
movements, 

§ 27. That throughout the ascending forms of life, along 
with increasing heterogeneity of structure and function.

70 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

there goes increasing heterogeneity of conduct — increasing 
diversity in the sets of external motions and combined 
sets of such motions — ^needs not be shown in detail. Nor 
need it be shown that becoming relatively great in the 
motions constituting the conduct of the uncivilized man, 
this heterogeneity has become still greater in those which 
the civiUzed man goes through. We may pass at once to 
that further degree of the like contrast which we see on 
ascending from the conduct of the immoral to that of the 
moral. 

Instead of recognizing this contrast, most readers will be 
inclined to identify a moral life with a life little varied in its 
activities. But here we come upon a defect in the current 
/conception of morality. This comparative uniformity in 
* the aggregate of motions, which goes along with morality 
as commonly conceived, is not only not moral but is the 
reverse of moral. The better a man fulfils every require- 
ment of life, alike as regards his own body and mind, as 
regards the bodies and minds of those dependent on him, 
and as regards the bodies and minds of his fellow- 
citizens, the more varied do his activities become. The more 
fully he does all these things, the more heterogeneous 
must be his movements. 

One who satisfies personal needs only, goes through, 
other things equal, less multiform processes than one who 
also administers to the needs of wife and children. Sup- 
posing there are no other difierences, the addition of family 
relations necessarily renders the actions of the man who 
fulfils the duties of husband and parent, more heterogeneous 
than those of the man who has no such duties to fulfil, or, 
having them, does not fulfil them ; and to say that his actions 
are more heterogeneous is to say that there is a greater 
heterogeneity in the combined motions he goes through. 
The like holds of social obligations. These, in proportion as a 
citizen duly performs them, complicate his movements 
considerably. If he is helpful to inferiors dependent ou

him^ if he takes a part in political agitation, if he aids in 
diflfusing knowledge, he, in each of these ways, adds to his 
kinds of activity — makes his sets of movements more 
multiform ; so differing from the man who is the slave 
of one desire or group of desires. 

Though it is unusual to consider as having a moral aspect, 
those activities which culture involves, yet to the few who 
hold that due exercise of all the higher faculties, intellectual 
and aesthetic, must be included in the conception of com- 
plete life, here identified with the ideally moral life, it will 
be manifest that a further heterogeneity is implied by 
them. For each of such activities, constituted by that play 
of these faculties which is eventually added to their life- 
subserving uses, adds to the multiformity of the aggregated 
motions. 

Briefly, then, if the conduct is the best possible on every 
occasion, it follows that as the occasions are endlessly 
varied the acts will be endlessly varied to suit — the hetero- 
geneity in the combinations of motions will be extreme. 

§ 28. Evolution in conduct considered under its moral 
aspect, is, like all other evolution, towards equilibrium. I 
do not mean that it is towards the equilibrium reached at 
death, though this is, of course, the final state which the 
evolution of the highest man has in common with all lower 
evolution ; but I mean that it is towards a Roving eqmli- 
brium. 

We have seen that maintaining life, expressed in physical 
terms, is maintaining a balanced combination of internal 
actions in face of external forces tending to overthrow it; 
and we have seen that advance towards a higher life, has 
been an acquirement of ability to maintain the balance for 
a longer period, by the successive additions of organic 
appliances which by their actions counteract, more and 
more fully, the disturbing forces. Here, then, we are led 
to the conclusion that the life called moral is one in which

72 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

tMs maintenance of the moving equilibrium reaches com- 
pleteness, or approaches most nearly to completeness. 

This truth is clearly disclosed on observing how those 
physiological rhythms which vaguely show themselves 
when organization begins, become more regular as well as 
more various in their kinds, as organization advances. 
Periodicity is but feebly marked in the actions, inner and 
outer, of the rudest types. Where life is low there is 
passive dependence on the accidents of the environment ; 
and this entails great irregularities in the vital processes. 
The taking in of food by a polype is at intervals now short 
now very long, as circumstances determine; and the 
utilization of it is by a slow dispersion of the absorbed 
part through the tissues, aided only by the irregular move- 
ments of the creature's body; while such aeration as is 
effected is similarly without a trace of rhythm. Much higher 
up we still find very imperfect periodicities ; as in the in- 
ferior molluscs which, though possessed of vascular systems, 
have no proper circulation, but merely a slow movement of 
the crude blood, now in one direction through the vessels 
and then, after a pause, in the opposite direction. Only 
with well-developed structures do there come a rhythmical 
pulse and a rhythm of the respiratory actions. And then 
in birds and mammals, along with great rapidity and regu- 
larity in these essential rhythms, and along with a conse- 
quently great vital activity and therefore great expenditure, 
comparative regularity in the rhythm of the alimentary 
actions is established, as well as in the rhythm of activity 
and rest ; since the rapid waste to which rapid pulsation and 
respiration are instrumental, necessitates tolerably regular 
supplies of nutriment, as well as recurring intervals of sleep 
during which repair may overtake waste.. And from 
these stages the moving equilibrium characterized by such 
inter-dependent rhythms, is continually made better by the 
counteracting of more and more of those actions which 
tend to perturb it. So is it as we ascend 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE PHYSICAL VIEW. 73 

from savage to civilized and from the lowest among the 
civilized to the highest. The rhythm of external actions 
required to maintain the rhythm of internal actions, becomes 
at once more complicated and more complete; making 
them into a better moving equilibrium. The irregularities 
which their conditions of existence entail on primitive men, 
continually cause wide deviations from the mean state of the 
moving equilibrium — ^wide oscillations ; which imply imper- 
fection of it for the time being, and bring about its 
premature overthrow. In such civilized men as we 
call ill-conducted, frequent perturbations of the moving 
equilibrium are caused by those excesses characterizing a 
career in which the periodicities are much broken; and 
a common result is that the rhythm of the internal actions 
being often deranged, the moving equilibrium, rendered by 
so much imperfect, is generally shortened in duration. 
While one in whom the internal rhythms are best main- 
tained is one by whom the external actions required to fulfil 
all needs and duties, severally performed on the recur- 
ring occasions, conduce to a moving equilibrium that is at 
once involved and prolonged. 

Of course the implication is that the man who thus 
reaches the limit of evolution, exists in a society congruous 
with his nature — is a man among men similarly constituted, 
who are severally in harmony with that social environment 
which they have formed. This is,indeed, the only possibility. 
For the. production of the highest type of man can go on only 
pari passu with the production of the highest type of society. 
The implied conditions are those before described as 
accompanying the most evolved conduct — conditions under 
which each can fulfil all his needs and rear the due number 
of progeny, not only without hindering others from doing 
the like, but while aiding them in doing the like. And 
evidently, considered under its physical aspect, the conduct 
of the individual so constitute^, and associated with like 
individuals, is one in which all the actions, that is the com- 
bined motions of all kinds, have become such as duly to

74 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

meet every daily process, every ordinary occurrence, and 
every contingency in his environment. Complete life in a 
complete society is but another name for complete equili- 
brium between the co-ordinated activities of each social unit 
and those of the aggregate of units. 

§ 29. Even to readers of preceding volumes, and still 
more to other readers, there will seem a strangeness, or 
even an absurdity, in this presentation of moral conduct 
in physical terms. It has been needful to make it however. 
If that re-distribution of matter and motion constituting 
evolution goes on in all aggregates, its laws' must be 
fulfilled in the most developed being as in every other 
thing; and his actions, when decomposed into motions, 
must exemplify its laws. This we find that they do. There 
is an entire correspondence between moral evolution and 
evolution as physically defined. 

Conduct as actually known to us in perception and 
not as interpreted into the accompanying feelings and 
ideas, consists of combined motions. On ascending 
through the various grades of animate creatures, we find 
these combined motions characterized by increasing cohe- 
rence, increasiQg definiteness considered singly and in their 
co-ordinated groups, and increasing heterogeneity ; and in 
advancing. from lower to higher types of man, as well as 
in advancing from the less moral to the more moral type of 
man, these traits of evolving conduct become more marked 
still. Further, we see that the increasing coherence, 
definiteness, and heterogeneity, of the combined motions, 
are instrumental to the better maintenance of a moving 
equilibrium. Where the evolution is small this is very 
imperfect and soon cut short; with advancing evolution, 
bringing greater power and intelligence, it becomes more 
steady and longer continued in face of adverse actions ; in 
the human race at large it is comparatively regular and 
enduring ; and its regularity and enduringness are greatest 
in the highest.

§ 30. The truth that the ideally moral man is one in 
whom the moving equilibrium is perfect, or approaches 
nearest to perfection, becomes, when translated into physio- 
logical language, the truth that he is one in whom the 
functions of all kinds are duly fulfilled. Bach function has 
some relation, direct or indirect, to the needs of life : the 
fact of its existence as a result of evolution, being itself a 
proof that it has been entailed, immediately or remotely, by 
the adjustment of inner actions to outer actions. Conse- 
quently, non-fulfilment of it in normal proportion is non- 
fulfilment of a requisite to complete life. If there is 
defective discharge of the function, the organism expe- 
riences some detrimental result caused by the inadequacy. 
If the discharge is in excess, there is entailed a reaction 
upon the other functions, which in some way diminishes 
their eflSciencies. 

It is true that during full vigour, while the momentum 
of the organic actions is great, the disorder caused by 
moderate excess or defect of any one function, soon 
disappears — the balance is re-established. But it is none 
the less true that always some disorder results from 
excess or defect, that it influences every function bodily 
and mental, and that it constitutes a lowering of the life for 
the time being. 

Beyond the temporary falling short of complete life

76 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

implied by undue or inadequate discharge of a function, 
there is entailed, as an ultimate result, decreased length of 
life. If some function is habitually performed in excess of 
the requirement, or in defect of the requirement ; and if, as 
a consequence, there is an often-repeated perturbation of the 
functions at large ; there results some chronic derangement 
in the balance of the functions. Necessarily reacting on the 
structures, and registering in them its accumulated effects, 
this derangement works a general deterioration; and 
when the vital energies begin to decline, the moving equili- 
brium, further from perfection than it would else have been, 
. is sooner overthrown : death is more or less premature. 
\ Hence the moral man is one whose functions — many and 
varied in their kinds as we have seen — are all discharged 
in degiies duly adjusted to the conditions of existence. ^ 

\ § 31. Strange as the conclusion looks, it is nevertheless a 
conclusion to be here drawn, that the performance of every 
function is, in a sense, a moral obligation. 

It is usually thought that morality requires us only to 
restrain such vital activities as, in our present state, 
are often pushed to excess, or such as conflict with 
average welfare, special or general; but it also requires 
us to carry on these vital activities up to their normal 
limits. All the animal functions, in common with aH 
the higher functions, have, as thus understood, their 
imperativeness. While recognizing the fact that, in our 
state of transition, characterized by very imperfect adap- 
tation of constitution to conditions, moral obligations of 
supreme kinds often necessitate conduct which is physically 
injurious ; we must also recognize the fact that, considered 
apart from other effects, it is immoral so to treat the body 
as in any way to diminish the fulness or vigour of its 
vitality. 

Hence results one test of actions. There may in every 
case be put the questions — ^Does the action tend to main-

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 77 

teuance of complete life for the time being ? and does it tend 
to prolongation of life to its full extent ? To answer yes or 
no to either of these questions^ is implicitly to class the 
action as right or wrong in respect of its immediate bearings, 
whatever it may be in respect of its remote bearings. 

.The seeming paradoxicalness of this statement results 
from the tendency, so difficult of avoidance, to judge a 
conclusion which pre-supposes an ideal humanity, by its 
applicability to humanity as now existing. The foregoing 
conclusion refers to that highest conduct in which, as we 
have seen, the evolution of conduct terminates — that con- 
duct in which the making of all adjustments of acts to ends 
subserving complete individual life, together with all those 
subserving maintenance of offspring and preparation of 
them for maturity, not only consist with the makin^of like 
adjustments by others, bat furthers it. And this ex- 
ception of conduct in its ultimate form, implies the 
conception of a nature having such conduct for its spon- 
taneous outcome — the product of its normal activities. 
So understanding the matter, it becomes manifest that 
under such conditions, any falling short of function, as 
well as any excess of function, implies deviation from the 
best conduct or from perfectly moral conduct. 

§ 82. Thus far in treating of conduct from the biological 
point of view, we have considered its constituent actions 
under their physiological aspects only; leaving out of 
sight their psychological aspects. We have recognized the 
bodily changes and have ignored the accompanying mental 
changes. And at first sight it seems needful for us here to 
do this; since taking account of states of consciousness, 
apparently implies an inclusion of the psychological view in 
the biological view. 

This is not so however. As was pointed out in the 
Principles of Psychology (§§ 52, 53) we enter upon psy- 
chology proper, only when we begin to treat of mental

79 THE DATA OV BTHICS. 

states and their relations^ considered as referring to external 
agents and their relations. While we concern ourselves 
exclosively with modes of mind as correlatives of nervous 
changes, we are treating of what was there distinguished as 
aestho-physiology. We pass to psychology only when we 
consider the correspondence between the connexions among 
subjective states and the connexions among objective 
actions. Here, then^ without transgressing the limits of 
onr immediate topic^ we may deal with feelings and functions 
in their mutual dependencies. 

We cannot omit doing this ; because the psychical changes 
which accompany many of the physical changes in the 
organism^ are biological factors in two ways. Those feel* 
ings^ classed as sensations, which^ directly initiated in 
the bodily framework, go along with certain states of the 
vital organs and more conspicuously with certain states 
of the external organs, now serve mainly as guides to 
the performance of functions but partly as stimuli, and 
now serve mainly as stimuli but in a smaller degree as 
guides. Visual sensations which, as co-ordinated, enable 
us to direct our movements, also, if vivid, raise the rate of 
respiration; while sensations of cold and heat, greatly 
depressing or raising the vital actions, serve also for pur- 
poses of discrimination. So, too, the feelings classed as 
emotions, which are not localizable in the bodily framework, 
act in more general ways, alike as guides and stimuli — 
having influences over the performance of functions more 
potent even than have most sensations. Fear, at the 
same time that it urges flight and evolves the forces spent 
in it, also affects the heart and the alimentary canal; while 
joy, prompting persistence in the actions bringing it, simul- 
taneously exalts the visceral processes. 

Hence in treating of conduct under its biological aspect, 
we are compelled to consider that inter-action of feelings and 
functions, which is essential to animal life in all its more 
develojped forms.

§ 83. In the Principles of Psychology, § 124, it was shown 
that necessarily, throughout the animate world at large, 
''pains are the correlatives of actions injurious to the 
organism, while pleasures are the correlatives of actions 
conducive to its welfare/' since ''it is an inevitable deduc- 
tion from the hypothesis of Evolution, that races of sentient 
creatures could have come into existence under no other 
conditions/' The argument was as follows : — 

If we snbstitate for the word Pleasure the equivalent phrase — ^a feeling which 
we seek to bring into consciousness and retain there, and if we substitute for 
tlie word Pain the equivalent phrase — a feeling which we seek to get out of 
consciousness and to keep out ; we see at once that, if the states of conscious- 
ness which a creature endeavours to maintain are the corrdatives of injurious 
actions, and if the states of consciousness which it endeavours to expel are the 
correlatives of beneficial actions, it must quickly disappear through persistence 
in the injurious and avoidance of the beneficial. In other words, those races 
of beings only can have survived in which, on the average, agreeable or desired 
feelings went along with activities conducive to the maintenance of life, while 
disagreeable and habitually-avoided feelings went along with activities directly 
or indirectly destructive of life ; and there must ever have been, other things 
equal, the most numerous and long-continued survivals among races in which 
these adjustments of feelings to actions were the best, tending ever to bring 
about perfect adjustment. 

Fit connexions between acts and results must establish 
themselves in living things, even before consciousness 
arises ; and after the rise of consciousness these connexions 
can change in no other way than to become better estab- 
lished. At the very outset, life is maintained by persistence 
in acts which conduce to it, and desistance from acts which 
impede it ; and whenever sentiency make its appearance as 
an accompaniment, its forms must be such that in the one 
case the produced feeling is of a kind that will be sought — 
pleasure, and in the other case is of a kind that will be 
shunned — ^pain. Observe the necessity of these relations as 
exhibited in the concrete. 

A plant which envelops a buried bone with a plexus of 
rootlets, or a potato which directs its blanched shoots 
towards a grating through which light comes into the cellar, 
shows us that the changes which outer agents themseli^s

80 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

set up in its tissues are changes which aid the utilization 
of these agents. If we ask what would happen if a 
plant's roots grew not towards the place where there was 
moisture but away from it, or if its leaves, enabled by light 
to assimilate, nevertheless bent themselves towards the dark- 
ness ; we see that death would result in the absence of the 
existing adjustments. This general relation is still better 
shown in an insectivorous plant, such as the Dioncea 
muacipula, which keeps its trap closed round animal matter 
but not round other matter. Here it is manifest that the 
stimulus arising from the first part of the absorbed substance, 
itself sets up those actions by which the mass of the sub- 
stance is utilized for the plant^s benefit. When 
we pass from vegetal organisms to unconscious animal 
organisms, we see a like connexion between proclivity 
and advantage. On observing how the tentacles of a 
polype attach themselves to, and begin to close round, a 
living creature, or some animal substance, while they are 
indifierent to the touch of other substance ; we are similarly 
shown that diffusion of some of the nutritive juices 
into the tentacles, which is an incipient assimilation, 
causes the motions effecting prehension. And it is obvious 
that life would cease were these relations reversed. Nor 
is it otherwise with this fundamental connexion between 
contact with food and taking in of food, among con- 
scious creatures, up to the very highest. Tasting a 
substance implies the passage of its molecules through 
the mucous membrane of the tongue and palate; and 
this absorption, when it occurs with a substance serving 
for food, is but a commencement of the absorption carried 
on throughout the alimentary canal. Moreover, the sensation 
accompanying this absorption, when it is of the kind pro- 
duced by food, initiates at the place where it is strongest, 
in front of the pharynx, an automatic act of swallowing, 
in a manner rudely analogous to that in which the stimulus 
of absorption in a polype's tentacles initiates prehension.

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 81 

If from these processes and relations tliat imply 
contact between a creature's surface and the substance 
it takes in, we turn to those set up by diffused particles 
of the substance, constituting to conscious creatures its 
odour, we meet a kindred general truth. Just as, after 
contact, some molecules of a mass of food are absorbed 
by the part touched, and excite the act of prehension ; so 
are absorbed such of its molecules as, spreading through 
the water, reach the organism, and, being absorbed by it, 
excite those actions by which contact with the mass is 
effected. If the physical stimulation caused by the dispersed 
particles is not accompanied by consciousness, still the 
motor changes set up must conduce to survival of the 
organism if they are such as end in contact ; and there 
must be relative innutrition and mortality of organisms in 
which the produced contractions do not bring about this 
result. Nor can it be questioned that whenever and wherever 
the physical stimulation has a concomitant sentiency, this must 
be such as consists with, and conduces to, movement towards 
the nutritive matter : it must be not a repulsive but an attrac- 
tive sentiency. And this which holds with the lowest con- 
sciousness, must hold throughout; as we see it do in all such 
superior creatures as are drawn to their food by odour. 

Besides those movements which cause locomotion, 
those which effect seizure must no less certainly 
become thus adjusted The molecular changes caused 
by absorption of nutritive matter from organic substance 
in contact, or from adjacent organic substance, initiate 
motions which are indefinite where the organization is 
low, and which become more definite with the advance of 
organization. At the outset, while the undifferentiated proto- 
plasm is everywhere absorbent and everywhere contractile, 
the changes of form initiated by the physical stimulation of 
adjacent nutritive matter are vague, and ineffectually 
adapted to utilization of it ; but gradually, along with the 
specialization into parts that are contractile and parts that

82 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

are absorbent^ these motions become better adapted; for 
necessarily individuals in wliicli they are least adapted dis- 
appear faster than those in which they are most adapted. 
Recognizing this necessity we have here especially to 
recognize a further necessity. The relation between these 
stimulations and adjusted contractions must be such that 
increase of the one causes increase of the other; since the 
directions of the discharges being once established^ greater 
stimulation causes greater contraction, and the greater 
contraction causing closer contact with the stimulating 
agent, causes increase of stimulus and is thereby itself 
further increased. And now we reach the corollary which 
more particularly concerns us. Clearly as fast as an accom- 
panying sentiency arises, this cannot be one that is 
disagreeable, prompting desistance, but must be one that is 
agreeable, prompting persistence. The pleasurable sensation 
must be itself the stimulus to the contraction by which the 
pleasurable sensation is maintained and increased ; or must 
be so bound up with the stimulus that the two increase 
together. And this relation which we see is directly 
established in the case of a fundamental function, must be 
indirectly established with all other functions ; since non- 
establishment of it in any particular case implies, in so far, 
unfitness to the conditions of existence. 

In two ways then, it is demonstrable that there exists a 
primordial connexion between pleasure-giving acts and 
continuance or increase of life, and, by implication, between 
pain-giving acts and decrease or loss of life. On the one 
hand, setting out with the lowest living things, we see 
that the beneficial act and the act which there is a ten- 
dency to perform, are originally two sides of the same; 
and cannot be disconnected without fatal results. On the 
other hand, if we contemplate developed creatures as now 
existing, we see that each individual and species is from day 
to day kept alive by pursuit of the agreeable and avoid- 
ance of the disagreeable.

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 83 

Thus approaching the facts from a different side, 
analysis brings us down to another face of that ultimate 
truth disclosed by analysis in a preceding chapter. We 
found it was no more possible to frame ethical conceptions 
from which the consciousness of pleasure, of some kind, at 
some time, to some being, is absent, than it is possible to 
frame the conception of an object from which the conscious- 
ness of space is absent. And now we see that this necessity 
of thought originates in the very nature of sentient existence. 
Sentient existence can evolve only on condition that pleasure- 
giving acts are life-sustaining acts. 

§ 34. Notwithstanding explanations already made, the 
naked enunciation of this as an ultimate truth, underlying 
all estimations of right and wrong, will in many, if not in 
most, cause astonishment. Having in view certain bene- 
ficial results that are preceded by disagreeable states of 
consciousness, such as those commonly accompanying 
labour; and having in view the injurious results that follow 
the receipt of certain gratifications, such as those which 
excess in drinking produces ; the majority tacitly or avowedly 
believe that the bearing of pains is on the whole beneficial, 
and that the receipt of pleasures is on the whole detrimental. 
The exceptions so fill their minds as to exclude the rule. 

When asked, they are obliged to admit that the pains 
accompanying wounds, bruises, sprains, are the concomitants 
of evils, alike to the sufferer and to those around him ; and 
that the anticipations of such pains serve as deterrents from 
careless or dangerous acts. They cannot deny that the 
tortures of burning or scalding, and the miseries which 
intense cold, starvation, and thirst produce, are indissolubly 
connected with permanent or temporary mischiefs, tending 
to incapacitate one who bears them for doing things that 
should be done, either for his own welfare or the welfare of 
others. The agony of incipient suffocation they are com- 
pelled to recognize as a safeguard to life, and must allow 

6 He

that avoidance of it is conducive to all that life can 
bring or achieve. Nor will they refuse to own that 
one who is chained in a cold, damp, dungeon, in 
darkness and silence, is injured in health and efficiency; 
alike by the positive pains thus inflicted on him and by 
the accompanying negative pains due to absence of light, 
of freedom, of companionship. Conversely, they 

do not doubt that notwithstanding occasional excesses the 
pleasure which accompanies the taking of food, goes along 
with physical benefit ; and that the benefit is the greater the 
keener the satisfaction of appetite. They have no choice but 
to acknowledge that the instincts and sentiments which so 
overpoweringly prompt marriage, and those which find their 
gratification in the fostering of offspring, work out an 
immense surplus of benefit after deducting all evils. Nor 
dare they question that the pleasure taken in accumu- 
lating property, leaves a large balance of advantage, private 
and public, after making all drawbacks. Yet many and 
conspicuous as are the cases in which pleasures and pains, 
sensational and emotional, serve as incentives to proper acts 
and deterrents from improper acts, these pass unnoticed ; 
and notice is taken only of those cases in which men are 
directly or indirectly misled by them. The well- working in 
essential matters is ignored; and the ill- working in 
unessential matters is alone recognized. 

Is it replied that the more intense pains and pleasures, 
which have immediate reference to bodily needs, guide 
us rightly; while the weaker pains and pleasures, not 
immediately connected with the maintenance of life, guide 
us wrongly ? Then the implication is that the system of 
guidance by pleasures and pains, which has answered with 
all types of creatures below the human, fails with the 
human. Or rather, the admission being that with mankind 
it succeeds in so far as fulfilment of certain imperative 
wants goes, it fails in respect of wants that are not impera- 
tive. Those who think this are required, in the first place.

to show US how the line is to be drawn between the two ; 
and then to show us why the system which succeeds in 
the lower will not succeed in the higher. ., \ 

§ 35. Doubtless, however, after all that has been said, 
there will be raised afresh the same difficulty — there will 
be instanced the mischievous pleasures and the beneficent 
pains. The drunkard, the gambler, the thief, who seve- 
rally pursue gratifications, will be named in proof that the 
pursuit of gratifications misleads ; while the self-sacrificing 
relative, the worker who perseveres through weariness, the 
honest man who stints himself to pay his way, will be 
named in proof that disagreeable modes of consciousness 
accompany acts that are really beneficial. But after 
recalling the fact pointed out in § 20, that this objection 
does not tell against guidance by pleasures and pains at 
large, since it merely implies that special and proximate 
pleasures and pains must be disregarded out of considera- 
tion for remote and diffused pleasures and pains ; and after 
admitting that in mankind as at present constituted, 
guidance by proximate pleasures and pains fails through- 
out a wide range of cases ; I go on to set forth the inter- 
pretation Biology gives of these anomalies, as being not 
necessary and permafient but incidental and temporary. 

Already while showing that among inferior creatures, 
pleasures and pains have all along guided the conduct 
by which life has been evolved and maintained, I have 
pointed out that since the conditions of existence for each 
species have been occasionally changing, there have been 
occasionally arising partial mis-adjustments of the feelings '/ 
to the requirements, necessitating re-adjustments. This 
general cause of derangement operating on all sentient 
beings, has been operating on human beings in a manner 
unusually decided, persistent, and involved. It needs but 
to contrast the mode of life followed by primitive men, 
wandering in the forests and living on wild food, with

So THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

the mode of life followed by rustics, artisans, traders, and 
professional men in a civilized community ; to see that the 
constitution, bodily and mental, well-adjusted to the one is ill- 
adjusted to the other. It needs but to observe the emotions 
kept awake in each savage tribe, chronically hostile to 
neighbouring tribes, and then to observe the emotions 
which peaceful production and exchange bring into play, 
to see that the two are not only unlike but opposed. And it 
needs but to note how, during social evolution, the ideas 
and sentiments appropriate to the militant activities 
carried on by coercive co-operation, have been at variance 
with the ideas and sentiments appropriate to the in- 
dustrial activities, carried on by voluntary co-operation; 
to see that there has ever been within each society, and 
still continues, a conflict between the two moral natures 
adjusted to these two unlike modes of life. Manifestly, then, 
this re-adjustment of constitution to conditions, involving 
re-adjustment of pleasures and pains for guidance, which 
all creatures from time to time undergo, has been in the 
human race during civilization, especially difficult ; not. only 
because of the greatness of the change from small nomadic 
groups to vast settled societies, and from predatory habits 
to peaceful habits ; but also because the old life of enmity 
between societies has been maintained along with the neW 
life of amity within each society. While there co-exist 
two ways of life so radically opposed as the militant 
and the industrial, human nature cannot become properly 
adapted to either. 

That hence results such failure of guidance by pleasures 
and pains as is daily exhibited, we discover on observing 
in what parts of conduct the failure is most conspicuous. 
As above shown, the pleasurable and painful sensations are 
fairly well adjusted to the peremptory physical requirements : 
the benefits of conforming to the sensations which prompt 
ns in respect of nutrition, respiration, maintenance of tem- 
perature, &c., immensely exceed the incidental evils ; and 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 87 

such mis-adjustments as occur may be ascribed to the change 
from the out-door life of the primitive man to the in-door 
life which the civilized man is often compelled to lead. It 
is the emotional pleasures and pains which are in so con- 
siderable a degree out of adjustment to the needs of life as 
carried on in society ; and it is of these that the re-adjust- 
ment is made, in the way above shown, so tardy because so 
diflScult. 
^' From the biological point of view then, we see that the 
connexions between pleasure and beneficial action and be- 
tween pain and detrimental action, which arose when sentient 
existence began, and have continued among animate creatures 
up to man, are generally displayed in him also throughout 
the lower and more completely-organized part of his nature; 
and must be more and more fully displayed throughout the 
higher part of his nature, as fast as his adaptation to the 
conditions of social life increases. 

§ 36. Biology has a further judgment to pass on the 
relations of pleasures and pains to welfare. Beyond the 
connexions between acts beneficial to the organism and 
the pleasures accompanying performance of them, and 
between acts detrimental to the organism and the 
pains causing desistance from them, there are connexions 
between pleasure in general and physiological exaltation, 
and between pain in general and physiological depression. 

) Every pleasure increases vitality; every pain decreases 
vitality. Every pleasure raises the tide of life ; every pain 
lowers the tide of life. Let us consider, first, the pains. 

By the general mischiefs that result from submission 
to pains, I do not mean those arising from the diffused 
efiects of local organic lesions, such as follow an aneurism 
caused by intense effort spite of protesting sensations, or 
such as follow the varicose veins brought on by continued 
disregard of fatigue in the legs, or such as follow the 
atrophy set up in muscles that are persistently exerted when

88 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

extremely weary ; but I mean the general mischiefs caused 
by that constitutional disturbance which pain forthwith sets 
up. These are conspicuous when the pains are acute, 
whether they be sensational or emotional. Bodily 

agony long bome^ produces death by exhaustion. More 
frequently, arresting the action of the heart for a time, it 
causes that temporary death we call fainting. On other 
occasions vomiting is a consequence. And where such 
manifest derangements do not result, we still, in the pallor 
and trembling, trace the general prostration. Beyond the 
actual loss of life caused by subjection to intense cold, there 
are depressions of vitality less marked caused by cold less 
extreme — temporary enfeeblement, following too long an 
immersion in icy water ; enervation and pining away con- 
sequent on inadequate clothing. Similarly is it with 
submission to great heat: we have lassitude reaching 
occasionally to exhaustion; we have, in weak persons, 
fainting, succeeded by temporary debilitation; and in 
steaming tropical jungles, Europeans contract fevers which 
when not fatal often entail life-long incapacities. Consider, 
again, the evils that follow violent exertion continued in 
spite of painful feelings — now a fatigue which destroys 
appetite or arrests digestion if food is taken, implying 
failure of the reparative processes when they are most 
needed ; and now a prostration of the heart, here lasting for 
a time and there, where the transgression has been repeated 
day after day, made permanent : reducing the rest of life to 
a lower level. No less conspicuous are the depressing 

effects of emotional pains. There are occasional cases of 
death from grief ; and in other cases the mental suffering 
which a calamity causes, like bodily suffering, shows its effects 
by syncope. Often a piece of bad news is succeeded by sick- 
ness ; and continued anxiety will produce loss of appetite, per- 
petual indigestion, and diminished strength. Excessive fear, 
whether aroused by physical or moral danger, will, in like 
manner, arrest for a time the processes of nutrition ; and^

not unfrequently, in pregnant women brings on mis- 
carriage ; while, in less extreme cases, the cold perspiration 
and unsteady hands indicate a geneml lowering of the vital 
activities, entailing partial incapacity of body or mind or 
both. How greatly emotional pain deranges the visceral 
actions is shown us by the fact that incessant worry 
is not unfrequently followed by jaundice. And here, 
indeed, the relation between cause and effect happens to 
have been proved by direct experiment. Making such 
arrangements that the bile-duct of a dog delivered its 
product outside the body, Claude Bernard observed that so 
long as he petted the dog and kept him in good spirits, 
secretion went on at its normal rate; but on speaking 
angrily, and for a time so treating him as to produce depres- 
sion, the flow of bile was arrested. Should it be said 
that evil results of such kinds are proved to occur only 
when the pains, bodily or mental, are great ; the reply is 
that in healthy persons the injurious perturbations caused by 
small pains, though not easily traced, are still produced; 
and that in those whose vital powers are much lowered 
by illness, slight physical irritations and trifling moral 
annoyances, often cause relapses. 

Quite opposite are the constitutional effects of pleasure. 
It sometimes, though rarely, happens that in feeble persons 
intense pleasure — pleasure that is almost pain — gives a 
nervous shock that is mischievous; but it does not do 
this in those who are undebilitated by voluntary or enforced 
submission to actions injurious to the organism. In the 
normal order, pleasures, great and small, are stimulants to 
the processes by which life is maintained. Among 

the sensations may be instanced those produced by bright 
light. Sunshine is enlivening in comparison with gloom 
— even a gleam excites a wave of pleasure ; and experiments 
have shown that sunshine raises the rate of respiration: 
raised respiration being an index of raised vital activities in 
generaL A warmth that is agreeable in degree favours the

heart's action, and furthers the various functions to which 
this is instrumental. Though those who are in full vigour 
and fitly clothed, can maintain their temperature in winter, 
and can digest additional food to make up for the loss of 
heat, it is otherwise with the feeble ; and, as vigour declines, 
the beneficence of warmth becomes conspicuous. That 
benefits accompany the agreeable sensations produced by 
fresh air, and the agreeable sensations that accompany 
muscular action after due rest, and the agreeable sensations 
caused by rest after exertion, cannot be questioned. Receipt 
of these pleasures conduces to the maintenance of the body 
in fit condition for all the purposes of Ufe. More 

manifest still are the physiological benefits of emotional 
pleasures. Every power, bodily and mental, is increased 
by *^good spirits/' which is our name for a general 
emotional satisfaction. The truth that the fundamental 
vital actitos — those of nutrition— are furthered by laughter- 
moving conversation, or rather by the pleasurable feeling 
causing laughter, is one of old standing; and every 
dyspeptic knows that in exhilarating company, a large and 
varied dinner including not very digestible things, may be 
eaten with impunity, and indeed with benefit, while a small, 
carefully-chosen dinner of simple things, eaten in solitude, 
will be followed by indigestion. This striking effect on 
the alimentary system is accompanied by effects, equally 
certain though less manifest, on the circulation and the 
respiration. Again, one who, released from daily labours 
and anxieties, receives delights from fine scenery or is 
enlivened by the novelties he sees abroad, comes back

energy with which he is prepared to pursue his ^vocation. 
Invalids especially, on whose narrowed margin of vitality 
the influence of conditions is most visible, habitually show 
the benefits derived from agreeable states of feeling. A 
lively social circle, the call of an old friend, or even removal 
to a brighter room, will, by the induced cheerfulness, much

improve the physical state. In brief, as every medical man 
knows, there is no snch tonic as happiness. 

These diffused physiological eflfects of pleasures and 
pains, which are joined with the local or special physiolo- 
gical effects, are, indeed, obviously inevitable. We have seen 
{Principles of Psychology, §§ 123 — 125) that while craving, 
or negative pain, accompanies the under-activity of an 
organ, and while positive pain accompanies its over-activity, 
pleasure accompanies its normal activity. We have seen 
that by evolution no other relations could be established ; 
since, through aU inferior types of creatures, if defect or 
excess of function produced no disagreeable sentiency, and 
medium function no agreeable sentiency, there would be 
nothing to ensure a proportioned performance of function. 
And as it is one of the laws of nervous action that 
each stimulus, beyond a direct discharge to the particular 
organ acted on, indirectly causes a general discharge 
throughout the nervous system {Prin. of Psy. §§21, 39), it 
results that the rest of the organs, all influenced as they 
are by the nervous system, participate in the stimu- 
lation. So that beyond the aid, more slowly shown, 
which the organs yield to one another through the 
physiological division of labour, there is the aid, more 
quickly shown, which mutual excitation gives. While 
there is a benefit to be presently felt by the whole organism 
from, the due performance of each function, there is an 
immediate benefit from the exaltation of its functions 
at large caused by the accompanying pleasure; and from 
pains, whether of excess or defect, there also come these 
double effects, immediate and remote. 

§ 37. Non-recognition of these general truths vitiates 
moral speculation at large. From the estimates of right 
and wrong habitually framed, these physiological effects 
wrought on the actor by his feelings are entirely omitted. 
It is tacitly assumed that pleasures and pains have no

reactions on the body of the recipient, affecting his fitness . 
for the duties of life. The only reactions recognized are 
those on character ; respecting which the current supposi- 
tion is, that acceptance of pleasures is detrimental and 
submission to pains beneficial. The notion, remotely 
descended, from the ghost-theory of the savage, that mind 
and body are independent, has, among its various implica- 
tions, this belief that states of consciousness are in no 
wise related to bodily states. ^^ You have had your gratifi- 
cation — ^it is past ; and you are as you were before,^' says 
the moralist to one. And to another he says, *' You have 
borne the suffering — it is over; and there the matter ends." 
Both statements are false. Leaving out of view indirect 
results, the direct results are that the one has moved a step 
away from death and the other has moved a step towards 
death. 

Leaving out of view, I say, the indirect results. It is 
these indirect results, here for the moment left out of view, 
which the moralist has exclusively in view: being so 
occupied by them that he ignores the direct results. The 
gratification, perhaps purchased at undue cost, perhaps 
enjoyed when work should have been done, perhaps snatched 
from the rightful claimant, is considered only in relation to 
remote injurious effects, and no set-off is made for imme- 
diate beneficial effects. Conversely, from positive and 
negative pains, borne now in the pursuit of some future 
advantage, now in discharge of responsibilities, now in 
performing a generous act, the distant good is alone dwelt 
on and the proximate evil ignored. Consequences, plea- 
surable and painful, experienced by the actor forthwith, are 
of no importance; and they become of importance only 
when anticipated as occurring hereafter to the actor or to 
other persons. And further, future evils borne by the 
actor are considered of no account if they result from self- 
denial, and are emphasized only when they result from 
self-gratification. Obviously, estimates so framed are erro-

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 93 

neous ; and obviously, the pervading judgments of conduct 
based on such estimates must be distorted. Mark the 
anomalies of opinion produced. 

If, as the sequence of a malady contracted in pursuit of 
illegitimate gratification, an attack of iritis injures vision, 
the mischief is to be counted among those entailed by 
immoral conduct; but if, regardless of protesting sensations, 
the eyes are used in study too soon after ophthalmia, and 
there follows blindness for years or for life, entailing not only 
persona] unhappiness but a burden on others, moralists 
are silent. The broken leg which a drunkard's accident 
causes, counts among those miseries brought on self and 
family by intemperance, which form the ground for repro- 
bating it; but if anxiety to fulfil duties prompts the 
continued use of a sprained knee spite of the pain, and 
brings on a chronic lameness involving lack of exercise, 
consequent ill-health, inefficiency, anxiety, and unhappiness, 
it is supposed that ethics has no verdict to give in the 
matter. A student who is plucked because he has spent 
in amusement the time and money that should have 
gone in study, is blamed for thus making parents 
unhappy and preparing for himself a miserable future; 
but another who, thinking exclusively of claims on him, 
reads night after night with hot or aching head, and, 
breaking down, cannot take his degree, but returns home 
shattered in health and unable to support himself, is 
named with pity only, as not subject to any moral judg- 
ment; or rather, the moral judgment passed is wholly 
favourable. 

Thus recognizing the evils caused by some kinds of con- 
duct only, men at large, and moralists as exponents of 
their beliefs, ignore the suflfering and death daily caused 
around them by disregard of that guidance which has 
established itself in the course of evolution. Led by the 
tacit assumption, common to Pagan stoics and Christian 
ascetics, that we are so diabolically organized that pleasures

are injarioas and pains beneficial^ people on all sides 
yield examples of lives blasted by persisting in actions 
against wliich their sensations rebel. Here is one who, 
drenched to the skin and sitting in a cold wind, pooh-poohs 
his shiverings and gets rheumatic fever with subsequent 
heart-disease, which makes worthless the short life remain- 
ing to him. Here is another who, disregarding painful 
feelings, works too soon after a debilitating illness, and 
establishes disordered health that lasts for the rest of his 
days, and makes him useless to himself and others. Now 
the account is of a youth who, persisting in gymnastic feats 
spite of scarcely bearable straining, bursts a blood-vessel, 
and, long laid on the shelf, is permanently damaged ; while 
now it is of a man in middle life who, pushing muscular 
efibrt to painful excess, suddenly brings on hernia. In this 
family is a case of aphasia, spreading paralysis, and death, 
caused by eating too little and doing too much; in that, 
softening of the brain has been brought on by ceaseless 
mental efforts against which the feelings hourly protested ; 
and in others, less serious brain-affections have been con- 
tracted by over-study continued regardless of discomfort and 
the cravings for fresh air and exercise.* Even without 
accumulating special examples, the truth is forced on us by 
the visible traits of classes. The careworn man of business 
too long at his office, the cadaverous barrister poring half 
the night over his briefs, the feeble factory hands and 
unhealthy seamstresses passing long hours in bad air, the 
anaemic, flat-chested school girls, bending over many lessons 
and forbidden boisterous play, no less than Sheffield grinders 
who die of suffocating dust, and peasants crippled with 
rheumatism due to exposure, show us the wide-spread 
miseries caused by persevering in actions repugnant to the 
sensations and neglecting actions which the sensations 
prompt. Nay the evidence is still more extensive and

Gonspicuons. What are the puny malformed children, 
seen in poverty-stricken districts, but children whose 
appetites for food and desires for warmth have not been 
adequately satisfied? What are populations stunted in 
growth and prematurely aged, such as parts of France 
show us, but populations injured by work in excess and 
food in defect : the one implying positive pain the other 
negative pain? What is the implication of that greater 
mortality which occurs among people who are weakened by 
privations, unless it is that bodily miseries conduce to fatal 
illnesses? Or once more, what must we infer from the 
frightful amount of disease and death suffered by armies in 
the field, fed on scanty and bad provisions, lying on damp 
ground, exposed to extremes of heat and cold, inadequately 
sheltered from rain, and subject to exhausting efibrts; 
unless it be the terrible mischiefs caused by continuously 
subjecting the body to treatment which the feelings protest 
against ? 

It matters not to the argument whether the actions 
entailing such effects are voluntary or involuntary. It 
matters not from the biological point of view, whether the 
motives prompting them are high or low. The vital functions 
accept no apologies on the ground that neglect of them was 
unavoidable, or that the reason for neglect was noble. The 
direct and indirect sufferings caused by nonconformity to 
the laws of life, are the same whatever induces the non- 
conformity ; and cannot be omitted in any rational estimate 
of conduct. If the purpose of ethical inquiry is to establish 
rules of right living; and if the rules of right living are 
those of which the total results, individual and general, 
direct and indirect, are most conducive to human happiness ; 
then it is absurd to ignore the immediate results and 
recognize only the remote results. 

§ 38. Here might be urged the necessity for preluding 
the study of moral science, by the study of biological

96 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

science. Here might be dwelt on the error men make in 
thinking they can understand those special phenomena of 
human life with which Ethics deals, while paying little 
or no attention to the general phenomena of human life, 
and while utterly ignoring the phenomena of life at 
large. And doubtless there would be truth in the 
inference that such acquaintance with the world of living 
things as discloses the part which pleasures and pains have 
played in organic evolution, would help to rectify these 
one-sided conceptions of moralists. It cannot be held, 
however, that lack of this knowledge is the sole cause, 
or the main cause, of their one-sidedness. For facts of the 
kind above instanced, which, duly attended to, would prevent 
such distortions of moral theory, are facts which it needs no 
biological inquiries to learn, but which are daily thrust 
before the eyes of all. The truth is, rather, that the general 
consciousness is so possessed by sentiments and ideas at 
variance with the conclusions necessitated by familiar evi- 
dence, that the evidence gets no attention. These adverse 
sentiments and ideas have several roots. 

There is the theological root. As before shown, from the 
worship of cannibal ancestors who delighted in witnessing 
tortures, there resulted the primitive conception of deities 
who were propitiated by the bearing of pains, and, con- 
sequently, angered by the receipt of pleasures. Through 
the religions of the semi-civilized, in which this conception 
of the divine nature remains conspicuous, it has persisted, 
in progressively modified forms, down to our own times ; 
and still colours the beliefs, both of those who adhere 
to the current creed and of those who nominally reject 
it. There is another root in the primitive and still- 

surviving militancy. While social antagonisms continue to 
generate war, which consists in endeavours to inflict pain 
and death while submitting to the risks of pain and 
death, and which necessarily involves great privations; 
it is needful that physical sufEering, whether consi-

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 97 

dered in itself or in tlie evils it beqneaths^ should be thought 
little of^ and that among pleasures recognized as most worthy 
should be those which victory brings. Nor does 

partially- developed industrialism fail to furnish a root. With 
social evolution, which implies transition from the life of 
wandering hunters to the life of settled peoples engaged in 
labour, and which therefore entails activities widely unlike 
those to which the aboriginal constitution is adapted, there 
comes an under-exercise of faculties for which the social 
state affords no'scope, and an over-taxing of faculties required 
for the social state : the one implying denial of certain 
pleasures and the other submission to certain pains. Hence, 
along with that growth of population which makes the 
struggle for existence intense, bearing of pains and sacrifice 
of pleasures is daily necessitated. 

Now always and everywhere, there arises among men a 
theory conforming to their practice. The savage nature, 
originating the conception of a savage deity, evolves a theory 
of supernatural control sufficiently stringent and cruel to 
influence his conduct. With submission to despotic govern- 
ment severe enough in its restraints to keep in order 
barbarous natures, there grows up a theory of divine right 
to rule, and the duty of absolute submission. Where war 
is made the business of life by the existence of warlike 
neighbours, virtues which are required for war come to be 
regarded as supreme virtues ; while, contrariwise, when 
industrialism has grown predominant, the violence and the 
deception which warriors glory in come to be held criminal. 
In Uke manner, then, there arises a tolerable adjustment of 
the actually-accepted (not the nominally-accepted) theory of 
right [living, to living as it is daily carried on. If the 
life is one that necessitates habitual denial of pleasures 
and bearing of pains, there grows up an answering ethical 
system under which the receipt of pleasures is tacitly 
disapproved and the bearing of pains avowedly approved. 
The mischiefs entailed by pleasures in excess are dwelt

on^ while the benefits which normal pleasures bring are 
ignored ; and the good results achieved by submission to 
pains are fully set forth while the evils are overlooked. 

But while recognizing the desirableness of, and indeed 
the necessity for, systems of ethics adapted, like religious 
systems and political systems, to their respective times and 
places ; we have here to regard the first as, like the others, 
transitional. We must infer that like a purer creed and a 
better government, a truer ethics belongs to a more advanced 
social state. Led, a priori, to conclude that distortions must 
exist, we are enabled to recognize as such, the distortions 
we find : answering in nature, as these do, to expectation. 
And there is forced on us the truth that a scientific 
morality arises only as fast as the one-sided conceptions 
adapted to transitory conditions, are developed into both- 
sided conceptions. The science of right living has to take ] 
account of all consequences in so far as they affect happi- 1 
ness, personally or socially, directly or indirectly; and by as 1 
much as it ignores any class of consequences, by so much • 
does it fail to be science. 

§ 39. Like the physical view, then, the biological view 
corresponds with the view gained by looking at conduct in 
general from the stand-point of Evolution. 

That which was physically defined as a moving equili- 
brium, we define biologically as a balance of functions. The 
implication of such a balance is that the several functions in 
their kinds, amounts, and combinations, are adjusted to the 
several activities which maintain and constitute complete 
life; and to be so adjusted is to have reached the goal 
towards which the evolution of conduct continually tends. 

Passing to the feelings which accompany the perform- 
ance of functions, we see that of necessity during the 
evolution of organic life, pleasures have become the con- 
comitants of normal amounts of functions, while pains, 
positive and negative, have become the concomitants of

THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 99 

excesses and defects of fanctions. And thougli in every 
species derangements of these relations are often caused 
by changes of conditions, they ever re-establish themselves : 
disappearance of the species being the alternative. 

Mankind, inheriting from creatures of lower kinds, such 
adjustments between feelings and functions as concern 
fundamental bodily requirements; and daily forced by 
peremptory feelings to. do the things which maintain life and 
avoid those which bring immediate death ; has been subject 
to a change of conditions unusually great and involved. 
This has considerably deranged the guidance by sensations, 
xmd has deranged in a much greater degree the guidance 
l)y emotions. The result is that in many cases pleasures are 
not connected with actions which must be performed, nor 
pains with actions which must be avoided, but contrariwise. 

Several influences have conspired to make men ignore the 
well-working of these relations between feelings and 
functions, and to observe whatever of ill-working is seen 
in them. Hence, while the evils which some pleasures entail 
fure dilated upon, the benefits habitually accompanying 
receipt of pleasures are unnoticed ; at the same time that the 
benefits achieved through certain pains are magnified while 
the immeuse mischiefs which pains bring are made little of. 

The ethical theories characterized by these perversions, 
are products of, and are appropriate to, the forms of 
social life which the imperfectly-adapted constitutions of 
men produce. But with the progress of adaptation, bring- 
ing faculties and requirements into harmony, such incon- 
gruities of experience, and consequent distortions of theory, 
must diminish ; until, along with complete adjustment of 
humanity to the social state, will go recognition of the truths 
that actions are completely right only when, besides being 
conducive to future happiness, special and general, they are 
immediately pleasurable, and that painfulness, not only 
ultimate but proximate, is the concomitant of actions which 
Are wrong.

100 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

So that from the biological point of view, ethical science 
becomes a specification of the conduct of associated men 
who are severally so constituted that the various self-pre- 
serving activities, the activities required for rearing offspring, 
and those which social welfare demands, are fulfilled in the 
spontaneous exercise of duly proportioned faculties, each 
yielding when in action its quantum of pleasure ; and who 
are, by consequence, so constituted that excess or defect in 
any one of these actions brings its quantum of pain, imme- 
diate and remote. 

Note to § 33. In his Physical Ethics, Mr. Alfred Barratt has expressed a 
view which here calls for notice. Postulating Evolntion and its general laws^ 
he refers to certain passages in the Princfi^les of Psychology (IstEd. Ft. IIL 
ch. viii. pp. 396, sqq. cf. Pt. IV. ch. iv.) in which I have treated of the relation 
between irritation and contraction which ''marks the dawn of sensitive life;" 
have pointed out that " the primordial tissue must be differently affected by 
contact with nutritive and with innutritive matters " — the two being for aquatic 
creatures respectively the soluble and the insoluble ; and have argued that 
the contraction by which a protruded part of a rhizopod draws in a fragment 
of assimilable matter " is caused by a commencing absorption of the assimilable 
matter." Mr. Barratt, holding that consciousness ''must be considered as 
an invariable property of animal life, and ultimately, in its elements, of 
the material universe" (p. 43), regards these responses of animal tissue 
to stimuli, as implying feeling of one or other kind. "Some kinds of 
impressed force," he says, "are followed by movements of retraction and 
withdrawal, others by such as secure a continuance of the impression. These 
two kinds of contraction are the phenomena and external marks of pain 
and pleasure respectively. Hence the tissue acts so as to secure pleasure 
and avoid pain by a law as truly physical and natural as that whereby a 
needle turns to the pole, or a tree to the light*' (p. 52). Now without 
questioning that the raw material of consciousness is present even in undiffer- 
entiated protoplasm, and everywhere exists {potentially in that Unknowable 
Power which, otherwise conditioned, is manifested in physical action (^Priii^ of 
Psy. § 272 — 3), I demur to the conclusion that It at first exists under the forms of 
pleasure and pain. These, I conceive, arise, as the more special feelings do, by 
a compounding of the ultimate elements of consciousness (Prin. of Psy. 
§§ 60, 61) : being, indeed, general aspects of these more special feelings when 
they reach certain intensities. Considering that even in creatures which have 
developed nervous systems, a great part of the vital processes are carried on by 
unconscious reflex actions, I see no propriety in assuming the existence of what 
we understand by consciousness in creatm'es not only devoid of nei vons systems 
but devoid of structures in general. 

Note to § 36. More than once in The Emoiiona and the Will, Dr. Bain 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW. 101 

insists on the connexion between pleasure and exaltation of vitality, and the 
connexion between pain and depression of vitality. As above shown, I concur 
in the view taken by him ; which is, indeed, put beyond dispute by general 
experience as well as by the more special experience of medical men. 

When, however, from the invigorating and relaxing effects of pleasure and 
pain respectively, Dr. Bain derives the original tendencies to persist in acts 
which give pleasure and to desist from those which give pain, I find myself 
unable to go with him. He says — "We suppose movements spontaneously 
begun, and accidentally causing plea^sure; we then assume that with the 
pleasure there will be an increase of vital energy, in which increase the 
fortunate movements will share, and thereby increase the pleasure. Or, on the 
•other hand, we suppose the spontaneous movements to give pain, and assume 
that, with the pain, there will be a decrease of energy, extending to the move- 
ments that cause the evil, and thereby providing a remedy " (3rd Ed. p. 316). 
This interpretation, implying that " the fortunate movements " merely aha/re in 
ihe effects of augmented vital energy caused by the pleasure, does not seem to me 
congruous with observation. The truth appears rather to be that though there 
is a concomitant general increase of muscular tone, the muscles specially 
excited are those which, by their increased contraction, conduce to increased 
pleasure. Conversely, the implication that desistance from spontaneous move- 
ments which cause pain, is due to a general muscular relaxation shared in by 
the muscles causing these particular movements, seems to me at variance with 
the fact that the retractation commonly takes the foim not of a passive lapse but 
of an active withdrawal. Further, it may be remarked that depressing as pain 
eventually is to the system at large, we cannot say that it at once depresses the 
muscular energies. Not simply, as Dr. Bain admits, does an acute smart produce 
spasmodic movements, but pains of all kinds, both sensational and emotional 
stimulate the muscles {Essays 1st seriesp. 360, l,or 2nd ed.Yol. I. p.2Il,12). Fain 
however (and also pleasure when very intense) simultaneously has an inhibitory 
effect on all the reflex actions ; and as the vital functions in general are carried 
on by reflex actions, this inhibition, increasing with the intensity of the pain, 
proportionately depresses the vital functions. Arrest of the heart's action and 
fainting is an extreme result of this inhibition; and the viscera at large feel its 
effects in degrees proportioned to the degrees of pain. Fain, therefore, while 
directly causing a discharge of muscular energy as pleasure does, eventually 
lowers muscular power by lowering those vital processes on which the supply 
of energy depends. Hence we cannot, I think, ascribe the prompt desistance from 
muscular movements causing pain, to decrease in the flow of energy ; for this 
decrease is felt only after an interval. Conversely, we cannot ascribe the per- 
sistence in a muscular act which yields pleasure to the resulting exaltation of 
energy ; but must, as indicated in § 33, ascribe it to the establishment of lines 
of discharge between the place of pleasurable stimulation and those contractile 
structures which maintain and increase ^he act causing the stimulation — 
connexions allied with the reflex, into which they pass by insensible gradations.

CHAPTER VIL 

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. 

§ 40. The last chapter, in so far as it dealt with feelings? 
in their relations to conduct, recognized only their physio- 
logical aspects : their psychological aspects were passed over. 
In this chapter, conversely, we are not concerned with 
the constitutional connexions between feelings, as in- 
centives' or deterrents, and physical benefits to be gained 
or mischiefs to be avoided; nor with the reactive effects of 
feelings on the state of the organism, as fitting or unfitting 
it for future action. Here we have to consider represented 
pleasures and pains, sensational and emotional, as consti- 
tuting deliberate motives — as forming factors in the con- 
scious adjustments of acts to ends. 

§ 41. The rudimentary psychical act, not yet differentiated 
from a physical act, implies an excitation and a motion. In 
a creature of low type the touch of food excites prehension. 
In a somewhat higher creature the odour from nutritive 
matter sets up motion of the body towards the matter. 
And where rudimentary vision exists, sudden obscuration of 
light, implying the passage of something large, causes con- 
vulsive muscular movements which mostly carry the body 
away from the source of danger. In each of these cases we 
may distinguish four factors. There is (a), that property of 
the external object which primarily affects the organism- 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE PSTCHOLOaiOAL VIEW. 103 

the taste, smelly or opacity; and^ connected with Buch 
property, there is in the external object that character (6), 
which renders seizure of it, or escape from it, beneficial. 
Within the organism there is (c), the impression or sensation 
which the property (a), produces, serving as stimulus; and 
there is, connected with it, the motor change {d), by 
which seizure or escape is eflfected. Now Psychology is 

chiefly concerned with the connexion between the relation 
a by and the relation e d, under all those forms which they 
assume in the course of evolution. Each of the factors, and 
each of the relations, grows more involved as organization 
advances. Instead of being single, the identifying attribute 
a, often becomes, in the environment of a superior animal, 
a cluster of attributes; such as the size, form, colours, 
motions, displayed by a distant creature that is dangerous. 
The factor 6, with which this combination of attri- 
butes is associated, becomes the congeries of characters, 
powers, habits, which constitute it an enemy. Of the 
subjective factors, c becomes a complicated set of visual 
sensations co-ordinated with one another and with the 
ideas and feelings established by experience of such enemies, 
and constituting the motive to escape ; while d becomes the 
intricate, and often prolonged, series of runs, leaps, doubles, 
dives, &c., made in eluding the enemy. In 

human life we find the same four outer and inner 
factors, still more multiform and entangled in their 
compositions and connexions. The entire assemblage of 
physical attributes a, presented by an estate that is 
advertized for sale, passes enumeration ; and the assemblage 
of various utilities, 5, going along with these attributes, 
is also beyond brief specification. The perceptions and 
ideas, likes and dislikes, c, set up by the aspect of 
the estate, and which, compounded and re-compounded, 
eventually form the motive for buying it, make a whole too 
large and complex for description; and the transactions, 
legal, pecuniary, and other, gone through in making the

104 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

puTcliase and taking possession, are scarcely less numerous 
and elaborate. Nor must we overlook the fact 

tliat as evolution progresses, not only do the factors increase 
in complexity but also the relations among them. Origi- 
nally, a is directly and simply connected with fc, while c is 
directly and simply connected with d. But eventually, the 
connexions between a and 6, and between c and d, become 
very indirect and involved. On the one hand, as the first 
illustration shows us, sapidity and nutritiveness are closely 
bound together ; as are also the stimulation caused by the 
one and the contraction which utilizes the other. But, as we 
see in the last illustration, the connexion between the 
visible traits of an estate and those characters which con- 
stitute its value, is at once remote and complicated ; while 
the transition from the purchaser's highly-composite motive 
to the numerous actions of sensory and motor organs, 
severally intricate, which effect the purchase, is though an 
entangled plexus of thoughts and feelings constituting his 
decision. 

After this explanation will be apprehended a truth 
otherwise set forth in the Principles of Psychology. Mind 
consists of feelings and the relations among feelings. By 
composition of the relations, and ideas of relations, intelli- 
gence arises. By composition of the feelings, and ideas of 
feelings, emotion arises. And, other things equal, the 
evolution of either is great in proportion as the composition 
is great. One of the necessary implications is that cognition 
becomes higher in proportion as it is remoter from reflex 
action ; while emotion becomes higher in proportion as it is 
remoter from sensation. 

And now of the various corollaries from this broad view 
of psychological evolution, let us observe those which 
concern the motives and actions that are classed as moral 
and immoral. 

§ 42. The mental process by which, in any case, the 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. 105 

adjustment of acts to ends is effected, and whicli, under 
its higher forms, becomes the subject-matter of ethical 
judgments, is, as above implied, divisible into the rise of a 
feeling or feelings constituting the motive, and the thought 
or thoughts through which the motive is shaped and finally 
issues in action. The first of these elements, originally an 
excitement, becomes a simple sensation ; then a compound 
fiensation; then a cluster of partially presentative and 
partially representative sensations, forming an incipient 
emotion ; then a cluster of exclusively ideal or representative 
sensations, forming an emotion proper ; then a cluster of such 
clusters, forming a compound emotion; and eventually 
becomes a still more involved emotion composed of the ideal 
forms of such compound emotions. The other element, 
beginning with that immediate passage of a single stimulus 
into a single motion, called reflex action, presently comes 
to be a set of associated discharges of stimuli producing 
associated motions, constituting instinct. Step by step arise 
more entangled combinations of stimuli, somewhat variable in 
their modes of union, leading to complex motions similarly 
variable in their adjustments ; whence occasional hesitations 
in the sensori-motor processes. Presently is reached a 
stage at which the combined clusters of impressions, not 
all present together, issue inactions not all simultaneous; 
implying representation of results, or thought. After- 
wards follow stages in which various thoughts have time 
to pass before the composite motives produce the appro- 
priate actions. Until at last arise those long delibera- 
tions during which the probabilities of various consequences 
are estimated, and the promptings of the correlative feel- 
ings balanced; constituting calm judgment. That under 
either of its aspects the later forms of this mental process 
are the higher, ethically considered as well as otherwise 
considered, will be readily seen. 

For from the first, complication of sentiency has accom- 
panied better and more numerous adjustments of acts to

ends ; as also has complication of movementi and compli' 
cation of the co-ordinating or intellectual process uniting 
the two. Whence it follows that the acts characterized by 
the more complex motives and the more involved thoughts^ 
have all along been of higher authority for guidance. 
Some examples will make this clear. 

Here is an aquatic creature guided by the odour of 
organic matter towards things serving for food; but a 
creature which, lacking any other guidance, is at the mercy 
of larger creatures coming near. Here is another which, 
also guided to food by odour, possesses rudimentary vision ; 
and so is made to start spasmodically away from a moving 
body which diflFuses this odour, in those cases where it is 
large enough to produce sudden obscuration of light — ^usually 
an enemy. Evidently life will frequently be saved by con- 
forming to the later and higher stimulus, instead of to ±hB 
earlieAbnd lower. Observe at a more advanced stage 

a parallel conflict. This is a beast which pursues others for 
prey, and, either lacking experience or prompted by raging 
hunger, attacks one more powerful than itself and gets 
destroyed. Conversely, that is a beast which, prompted by 
a hunger equally keen, but either by individual experience 
or eflfects of inherited experience, made conscious of evil 
by the aspect of one more powerful than itself, is deterred 
from attacking, and saves its life by subordinating the 
primary motive, consisting of craving sensations, to the 
secondary motive, consisting of ideal feelings, distinct or 
vague. Ascending at once from these examples of 

conduct in animals to examples of human conduct, we 
shall see that the contrasts between inferior and superior 
have habitually the same traits. The savage of lowest type 
devours all the food captured by to-day ^s chase; and, hungry 
on the morrow, has perhaps for days to bear the pangs 
of starvation. The superior savage, conceiving more vividly 
the entailed sufierings if no game is to be found, is deterred 
by his complex feeling from giving way entirely to his

THE PSTCHOLOOTCAL VIEW. 107 

simple feeling. Similarly are the two contrasted in the 
inertness which goes along with lack of forethought, and the 
activity which due forethought produces. The primitive man, 
idly inclined, and ruled by the sensations of the moment, 
will not exert himself until actual pains have to be 
escaped ; but the man somewhat advanced, able more dis- 
tinctly to imagine future gratifications and sufferings, is 
prompted by the thought of these to overcome his love of, 
ease : decrease of misery and mortality resulting from this 
predominance of the representative feelings over the 
presentative feelings. Without dwelling on the 

fact that among the civilized, those who lead the life of the 
senses are contrasted in the same way with those whose 
lives are largely occupied with pleasures not of a sensual 
kind, let me point out that there are analogous contrasts 
between guidance by the less complex representative feel- 
ings, or lower emotions, and guidance by the more complex 
representative feelings, or higher emotions. When led by 
his acquisitiveness — a re-representative feeling which, acting 
under due control, conduces to welfare — ^the thief take* 
another man's property, his act is determined by certain 
imagined proximate pleasures of relatively simple kinds, 
rather than by less-clearly imagined possible pains that are 
more remote and of relatively involved kinds. But in 
the conscientious man, there is an adequate restraining 
motive, still more re-representative in its nature, including 
not only ideas of punishment, and not only ideas of lost, 
reputation and ruin, but including ideas of the claims of the 
person owning the property, and of the pains which loss of 
it will entail on him : all joined with a general aversion to 
acts injurious to others, which arises from the inherited 
effects of experience. And here at the end we see, as we 
saw at the beginning, that guidance by the more complex 
feeling, on the average conduces to welfare more than does 
guidance by the simpler feeling. 

The like holds with the intellectual co-ordinations through

108 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

iivlicli stimuli issue in motions. The lowest actions, called 
reflex, in which an impression made on an afierent 
nerve causes by discharge through an efferent nerve a 
contraction, shows us a very limited adjustment of acts to 
'Onds: the impression being simple, and the resulting 
motion simple, the internal co-ordination is also simple. 
Evidently when there are several senses which can be 
together affected by an outer object ; and when, according 
as such object is discriminated as of one or other kind, 
the movements made in response are combined in one or 
other way ; the intermediate co-ordinations are necessarily 
more involved. And evidently each further step in the 
'evolution of intelligence, always instrumental to better 
self-preservation, exhibits this same general trait. The 
adjustments by which the more involved actions are 
made appropriate to the more involved circumstances, 
^mply more intricate, and consequently more deliberate and 
conscious, co-ordinations ; until, when we come to civilized 
men, who in their daily business taking into account many 
data and conditions adjust their proceedings to various 
consequences, we see that the intellectual actions, 
becoming of the kind we call judicial, are at once very 
elaborate and very deliberate. 

Observe, then, what follows respecting the relative 
authorities of motives. Throughout the ascent from low 
creatures up to man, and from the lowest types of man 
up to the highest, self-preservation has been increased 
by the subordination of simple excitations to compound 
excitations — the subjection of immediate sensations to the 
ideas of sensations to come — the over-ruling of presenta- 
tive feelings by representative feelings, and of representa- 
tive feelings by re-representative feelings. As life has 
advanced, the accompanying sentiency has become in- 
-creasingly ideal; and among feelings produced by the 
compounding of ideas, the highest, and those which have 
-evolved latest, are the re-compounded or doubly ideal. Hence

it follows that as guides, the feelings have anthoritie^ 
proportionate to the degrees in which they are removed by 
their complexity and their ideality from simple sensa* 
tions and appetites. A farther implication is 

made clear by studying the intellectual sides of these 
mental processes by which acts are adjusted to ends. 
"Where they are low and simple, these comprehend 
the guiding only of immediate acts by immediate sti- 
muli — the entire transaction in each case, lasting but a 
moment, refers only to a proximate result. But with the 
development of intelligence and the growing ideality of 
the motives, the ends to which the acts are adjusted cease 
to be exclusively immediate. The more ideal motives 
concern ends that are more distant ; and with approach to- 
the highest types, present ends become increasingly sub- 
ordinate to those future ends which the ideal motives have 
for their objects. Hence there arises a certain presumption 
in favour of a motive which refers to a remote good, in. 
comparison with one which refers to a proximate good. 

§ 43. In the last chapter I hinted that besides the 
several influences there named as fostering the ascetic 
belief that doing things which are agreeable is detrimental 
while bearing disagreeable things is beneficial, there 
remained to be named an influence of deeper origin. Thi& 
is shadowed forth in the foregoing paragraphs. 

For the general truth that guidance by such simple 
pleasures and pains as result from fulfilling or denying 
bodily desires, is, under one aspect, inferior to guidance by 
those pleasures and pains which the complex ideal feelings 
yield, has led to the belief that the promptings of bodily 
desires should be disregarded. Further, the general truth 
that pursuit of proximate satisfactions is, under one aspect^ 
inferior to pursuit of ultimate satisfactions, has led to the 
belief that proximate satisfactions must not be valued. 

In the early stages of every science, the generalizations 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



110 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

reached are not qualified enough. The discriminating state- 
ments of the truths formulated^ arise afterwards^ by limitation 
of the undiscriminating statements. As with bodily vision, 
which at first appreciates only the broadest traits of objects, 
and so leads to rude classings which developed vision, 
impressible by minor differences, has to correct; so with 
mental vision in relation to general truths, it happens that 
at first the inductions, wrongly made all-embracing, have 
to wait for scepticism and critical observation to restrict 
them, by taking account of unnoticed differences. Hence, 
we may expect to find the current ethical conclusions too 
sweeping. Let us note how, in three ways, these dominant 
beliefs, alike of professed moralists and of people at large, 
are made erroneous by lack of qualifications. 

In the first place, the authority of the lower feelings as 
guides is by no means always inferior to the authority of 
the higher feelings, but is often superior. Daily occur 
occasions on which sensations must be obeyed rather than 
sentiments. Let any one think of sitting all night naked in 
a snowstorm, or going a week without food, or letting his 
head be held under water for ten minutes, and he will see 
that the pleasures and pains directly related to main* 
tenance of life, may not be wholly subordinated to the 
pleasures and pains indirectly related to maintenance of 
life. Though in many cases guidance by the simple feelings 
rather than by the complex feelings is injurious, in other 
cases guidance by the complex f eeUngs rather than by the 
simple feelings is fatal; and throughout a wide range 
of cases their relative authorities as guides are inde- 
terminate. Grant that in a man pursued, the protesting 
feelings accompanying intense and prolonged effort, must, 
to preserve life, be over-ruled by the fear of his pursuers ; 
it may yet happen that, persisting till he drops, the resulting 
exhaustion causes death, though, the pursuit having been 
abandoned, death would not otherwise have resulted. Grant 
that a widow left in poverty, must deny her appetite that 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. Ill 

she may give enough food to her children to keep them 
aKve j yet the denial of her appetite pushed too far, may 
leave them not only entirely without food but without 
guardianship. Grant that, working his brain unceasingly 
from .dawn till dark, the man in pecuniary difficulties must 
disregard rebellious bodily sensations in obedience to the 
<;onscientious desire to liquidate the claims on him ; yet he 
may carry this subjection of simple feelings to complex 
feelings to the extent of shattering his health, and failing 
in that end which, with less of this subjection, he might 
have achieved. Clearly, then, the subordination of lower 
feelings must be a conditional subordination. The supre- 
macy of higher feelings must be a quahfied supremacy. 

In another way does the generalization ordinarily made 
err by excess. With the truth that life is high in pro- 
portion as the simple presentative feelings are under the 
control of the compound representative feelings, it joins, as 
though they were corollaries, certain propositions which 
are not corollaries. The current conception is, not that the 
lower must yield to the higher when the two conflict, but 
that the lower must be disregarded even when there is no 
conflict. This tendency which the growth of mor.il ideas 
has generated, to condemn obedience to inferior feelings 
when superior feelings protest, has begotten a tendency to 
condemn inferior feelings considered intrinsically. " I really 
think she does things because she likes to do them,*' once said 
to me one lady concerning another : the form of expression 
and the manner both implying the belief not only that such 
behaviour is wrong, but also that every one must recognize 
it as wrong. And there prevails widely a notion of this 
kind. In practice, indeed, the notion is very generally 
inoperative. Though it prompts various incidental asce- 
ticisms, as of those who think it alike manly and salutary to 
go without a great coat in cold weather, or to persevere 
through the winter in taking an out-of-door plunge, yet, 
generally, the pleasurable feelings accompanying due fulfil-

112 THE DATA 07 ETHICS. 

ment of bodily needs^ are accepted: acceptance being, 
indeed, sufficiently peremptory. But oblivious of these 
contradictions in their practice, men commonly betray a 
vague idea that there is something degrading, or injurious, 
or both, in doing that which is agreeable and avoiding that 
which is disagreeable. "Pleasant but wrong,*' is a phrase 
frequently used in a way implying that the two are naturally 
connected. As above hinted, however, such beliefs result from 
a confused apprehension of the general truth that the more 
compound and representative feelings ai'e, on the average, 
of higher authority than the simple and presentative feel- 
ings. Apprehended with discrimination, this truth imphes 
that the authority of the simple, ordinarily less than that of 
the compound but occasionally greater, is habitually to be 
accepted when the compound do not oppose. 

In yet a third way is this principle of subordination 
misconceived. One of the contrasts between the earlier- 
evolved feelings and the later-evolved feelings, is that they 
refer respectively to the more immediate effects of actions 
and to the more remote effects ; and speaking generally, 
guidance by that which is near is inferior to guidance by 
that which is distant. Hence has resulted the belief that, 
irrespective of their kinds, the pleasures of the present 
must be sacrificed to the pleasures of the future. We see 
this in the maxim often impressed pn children when eating 
their meals, that they should reserve the nicest morsel till 
the last : the check on improvident yielding to immediate 
impulse, being here joined with the tacit teaching that 
the same gratification becomes more valuable as it becomes 
more distant. Such thinking is traceable throughout 
daily conduct ; by no means indeed in all, but in those who 
are distinguished as prudent and well regulated in their 
conduct. Hurrying over his breakfast that he may catch 
the train, snatching a sandwich in the middle of the day, 
and eating a late dinner when he is so worn out that he is 
incapacitated for evening recreation, .the man of business

pnrsnes a life in which not only the satis&ctions of bodily 
desireSj but also those of higher tastes and feelings^ are^ as 
far as may be^ disregarded^ that distant ends may be achieved ; 
and yet if yon ask what are these distant ends, yon find (in 
cases where there are no parental responsibilities) that 
they are incladed nnder the conception of more comfortable 
living in time to come. So ingrained is this belief that it 
is wrong to seek immediate enjoyments and right to seek 
remote ones only, that yon may hear from a bnsy man who 
has been on a pleasure excursion, a kind of apology for his 
conduct. He deprecates the unfavourable judgments of his 
friends by explaining that the state of his health had com- 
pelled him to take a holiday. Nevertheless, if you sound 
him with respect to his future, you find that his ambition is 
by-and-by to retire and devote himself wholly to the relaxa- 
tions which he is now somewhat ashamed of taking. 

The general truth disclosed by the study of evolving 
conduct, sub-human and human, that for the better preser- 
vation of life the primitive, simple, presentative f eeUngs must 
be controlled by the later-evolved, compound, and repre- 
sentative feelings, has thus come, in the course of civilization, 
to be recognized by men; but necessarily at first in too 
indiscriminate a way. The current conception, while it 
errs by implying that the authority of the higher over the 
lower is unlimited, errs also by implying that the rule of the 
lower must be resisted even when it does not conflict with 
the rule of the higher, and further errs by implying that a 
gratification which forms a proper aim if it is remote, forms 
an improper aim if it is proximate. 

§ 44. Without explicitly saying so, we have been here 
tracing the genesis of the moral consciousness. For un- 
questionably the essential trait in the moral consciousness, 
is the control of some feeling or feeUngs by some other 
feeling or feelings. 

Among the higher animals we may see, distinctly enough,

the conflict of feelings and the subjection of simpler to 
more compound; as when a dog is restrained from 
snatching food by fear of the penalties which may come if 
he yields to his appetite; or as when he desists from scratch- 
ing at a hole lest he should lose his master, who has walked 
on. Here, however, though there is subordination, there 
is not conscious subordination — there is no introspection 
revealing the fact that one feeling has yielded to another. So 
is it even with human beings when little developed mentally. 
The pre-social man, wandering about in families and ruled 
by such sensations and emotions as are caused by the 
circumstances of the moment, though occasionally subject to 
conflicts of motives, meets with comparatively few cases in 
which the advantage of postponing the immediate to the 
remote is forced on his attention ; nor has he the intelligence 
requisite for analyzing and generalizing such of these cases 
as occur. Only as social evolution renders the life more 
complex, the restraints many and strong, the evils of 
impulsive conduct marked, and the comforts to be gained by 
providing for the future tolerably certain, can there come 
experiences numerous enough to make familiar the benefit 
of subordinating the simpler feelings to the more complex 
ones. Only then, too, does there arise a sufficient intel- 
lectual power to make an induction from these experiences, 
followed by a sufficient massing of individual inductions 
into a public and traditional induction impressed on each 
generation as it grows up. 

And here we are introduced to certain facts of profound 
significance. This conscious relinquishment of immediate 
and special good to gain distant and general good, 
while it is a cardinal trait of the self-restraint called moral, 
is also a cardinal trait of self-restraints other than those 
called moral — ^the restraints that originate from fear of the 
visible ruler, of the invisible ruler, and of society at large. 
"Whenever the individual refrains from doing that which the 
passing desire prompts, lest he should afterwards suffer

legal pnnisliment, or divine vengeance, or public repro- 
bation, or all of them, lie surrenders the near and 
definite pleasure rather than risk the remote and greater, 
though less definite, pains, which taking it may bring on 
him; and, conversely, when he undergoes some present pain, 
that he may reap some probable future pleasure, political, 
religious, or social. But though all these four kinds of 
internal control have the common character that the simpler 
and less ideal feelings are consciously over-ruled by the 
more complex and ideal feelings ; and though, at first, they 
are practically co-extensive and undistinguished ; yet, in the 
course of social evolution they diflferentiate ; and, eventually, 
the moral control with its accompanying conceptions and 
sentiments, emerges as independent. Let us glance at the 
leading aspects of the process. 

While, as in the rudest groups, neither political nor 
religious rule exists, the leading check to the immediate 
satisfaction of each desire as it arises, is consciousness of 
the evils which the anger of fellow savages may entail, if 
satisfaction of the desire is obtained at their cost. In this 
early stage the imagined pains which constitute the 
governing motive, are those apt to be inflicted by beings 
of like nature, undistinguished in power: the political, 
religious, and social restraints, are as yet represented only 
by this mutual dread of vengeance. When special 

strength, skill, or courage, makes one of them a leader in 
battle, he necessarily inspires greater fear than any other ; 
and there comes to be a more decided check on such 
satisfactions of the desires as will injure or offend him. 
Gradually as, by habitual war, chieftainship is established, 
the evils thought of as likely to arise from angering the 
chief, not only by aggression upon him but by disobedi- 
ence to him, become distinguishable both from the smaller 
evils which other personal antagonisms cause, and from 
the more diffused evils thought of as arising from social 
reprobation. That is, political control begins to dif-

ferentiate from the more indefinite control of mutual 
dread. Meanwhile there has been developing the 

ghost-theory. In all but the rudest groups, the double 
of a deceased man, propitiated at death and afterwards, is 
conceived as able to injure the survivors. Consequently, 
as fast as the ghost-theory becomes established and 
definite, there grows up another kind of check on immediate 
satisfaction of the desires — a check constituted by ideas 
of the evils which ghosts may inflict if offended; and 
when political headship gets settled, and the ghosts of 
dead chiefs, thought of as more powerful and more relentless 
than other ghosts, are especially dreaded, there begins to 
take shape the form of restraint • distinguished as reli- 
gious. For a long time these three sets of 
restraints, with their correlative sanctions, though becoming 
separate in consciousness, remain co-extensive; and do so 
because they mostly refer to one end— success in war ^ 
The duty of blood-revenge is insisted on even while yet 
nothing to be called social organization exists. As the chief 
gains predominance, the killing of enemies becomes a poli- 
tical duty ; and as the anger of the dead chief comes to be 
dreaded, the killing of enemies becomes a religious duty. 
Loyalty to the ruler while he lives and after he dies, 
is increasingly shown by holding life at his disposal for 
purposes of war. The earliest enacted punishments are those 
for insubordination and for breaches of observances which ex- 
press subordination — all of them militant in origin. While 
the divine injunctions, originally traditions of the dead king^s 
will, mainly refer to the destruction of peoples with whom he 
was at enmity ; and divine anger or approval are conceived 
as determined by the degrees in which subjection to him 
is shown, directly by worship and indirectly by fulfilling these 
injunctions. The Fijian, who is said on entering the other 
world to commend himself by narrating his successes in 
battle, and who, when alive, is described as sometimes greatly 
distressed if he thinks he has not killed enemies enough to

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. 117 

please his gods^ shows us the resulting ideas and feelings ; 
and reminds us of kindred ideas and feelings betrayed by 
ancient races. To all which add that the control 

of social opinion, besides being directly exercised, as in 
the earliest stage, by praise of the brave and blame of 
the cowardly, comes to be indirectly exercised with a 
kindred general effect by applause of loyalty to the ruler 
and piety to the god. So that the three difiFerentiated 
forms of control which grow up along with militant organi- 
zation and action, whUe enforcing kindred restraints and 
incentives, also enforce one another ; and their separate and 
joint disciplines have the common character that they in- 
volve the sacrifice of immediate special benefits to obtain 
more distant and general benefits. 

At the same time there have been developing under the 
same three sanctions, restraints and incentives of another 
order, similarly characterized by subordination of the proxi- 
mate to the remote. Joint aggressions upon men outside 
the society, cannot prosper if there are many aggressions of 
man on man within the society. War implies co-operation ; 
and co-operation is prevented by antagonisms among those 
who are to co-operate. We saw that in the primitive un- 
governed group, the main check on immediate satisfaction of 
his desires by each man, is the fear of other men^s vengeance 
if they are injured by taking the satisfaction; and through 
early stages of social development, this dread of retaliation 
continues to be the chief motive to such forbearance as 
exists. But though long after political authority has become 
established the taking of personal satisfaction for injuries 
persists, the growth of political authority gradually checks 
it. The fact that success in war is endangered if his followers 
fight among themselves, forces itself on the attention of 
the ruler. He has a strong motive for restraining quarrels, 
and therefore for preventing the aggressions which cause 
quarrels ; and as his power becomes greater he forbids the 
aggressions and inflicts punishments for disobedience.

118 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

Presently, political restraints of this class, like those of the 
preceding class, are enforced by religious restraints. The 
sagacious chief, succeeding in war partly because he thus 
enforces order among his followers, leaves behind him a 
tradition of the commands he habitually gave. Dread of his 
ghost tends to produce regard for these commands ; and 
they eventually acquire sacredness. With further social 
evolution come, in like manner, further interdicts, checking 
aggressions of less serious kinds ; until eventually there grows 
up a body of civil laws. And then in the way shown, arise 
beliefs concerning the divine disapproval of these minor, as 
well as of the major, civil offences : ending, occasionally, in 
a set of religious injunctions harmonizing with, and en- 
forcing, the political injunctions. While simultaneously 
there develops, as before, a social sanction for these rules of 
internal conduct, strengthening the political and religious 
sanctions. 

But now observe that while these three controls, political, 
religious, and social, severally lead men to subordinate 
proximate satisfactions to remote satisfactions; and while 
they are in this respect like the moral control, which habi- 
tually requires the subjection of simple presentative feelings 
to complex representative feelings and postponement of 
present to future; yet they do not constitute the moral 
control, but are only preparatory to it — are controls within 
which the moral control evolves. The command of the 
political ruler is at first obeyed, not because of its perceived 
rectitude; but simply because it is his command, which 
there will be a penalty for disobeying. The check is 
not a mental representation of the evil consequences which 
the forbidden act will, in the nature of things, cause ; but 
it is a mental representation of the factitious evil conse- 
quences. Down to our own time we trace in legal phrases, 
the original doctrine that the aggression of one citizen 
on another is wrong, and will be punished, not so much 
because of the injury done him, as because of the implied

disregard of tlie king's will. Similarly, the sinfulness of 
breaking a divine injunction was universally at one time, 
and is still by many, held to consist in the disobedience to 
God, rather than in the deliberate entailing of injury ; and 
even now it is a common belief that acts are right only 
if performed in conscious fulfilment of the divine wiU : nay, 
are even wrong if otherwise performed. The like holds, too, 
with that further control exercised by public opinion, 
On listening to the remarks made respecting conformity to 
social rules, it is noticeable that breach of them is condemned 
not so much because of any essential impropriety as because 
the world's authority is ignored. How imperfectly the 
truly moral control is even now differentiated from these 
controls within which it has been evolving, we see in the fact 
that the systems of morality criticized at the outset, severally 
identify moral control with one or other of them. For 
moralists of one class derive moral rules from the com- 
mands of a supreme political power. Those of another 
class recognize no other origin for them than the revealed 
divine will. And though men who take social prescription for 
their guide do not formulate their doctrine, yet the belief, 
frequently betrayed, that conduct which society permits is 
not blameworthy, implies that there are those who think 
right and wrong can be made such by public opinion. 
V Before taking a further step we must put together the 
results of this analysis. The essential truths to be carried 
with us respecting these three forms of external control to 
which the social unit is subject, are these :— First, that they 
have evolved with the evolution of society, as means to 
social self-preservation, necessary under the conditions; and 
that, by implication, they are in the main congruous with 
one another. Second, that the correlative internal restraints 
generated in the social unit, are representations of remote 
results which are incidental rather than necessary — a legal 
penalty, a supernatural punishment, a social reprobation. 
Third, that these results, simpler and more directly wrought

120 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

by .personal agencies, can be more vividly conceived than 
can the results which, in the course of things, actions 
naturally entail; and the conceptions of them are therefore 
more potent over undeveloped minds. Fourth, that as with 
the restraints thus generated is always joined the thought 
of external coercion, there arises the notion of obligation ; 
which so becomes habitually associated with the surrender of 
immediate special benefits for the sake of distant and general 
benefits. Fifth, that the moral control corresponds in large 
measure with the three controls thus originating, in respect 
of its injunctions; and corresponds, too, in the general 
nature of the mental processes producing conformity to 
those injunctions ; but differs in their special nature. 

§ 45. For now we are prepared to see that the restraints 
properly distinguished as moral, are unlike these restraints 
out of which they evolve, and with which they are long 
confounded, in this — they refer not to the extrinsic effects 
of actions but to their intrinsic effects. The truly moral 
deterrent from murder, is not constituted by a representation 
of hanging as a consequence, or by a representation of 
tortures in hell as a consequence, or by a representation of 
the horror and hatred excited in fellow men; but by a 
representation of the necessary natural results — ^the inflic- 
tion of death-agony on the victim, the destruction of all his 
possibilities^ of happiness, the entailed sufferings to his 
belongings)^ Neither the thought of imprisonment, nor of 
divine anger, nor of social disgrace, is that which constitutes 
the moral check on theft ; but the thought of injury to the 
person robbed, joined with a vague consciousness of the 
general evils caused by disregard of proprietary rights. 
Those who reprobate the adulterer on moral grounds, have 
their- minds fiUed, not with ideas of an action for damages^

busbandj the damaged lives of children^ and the diffused 
mischiefs which go along with disregard of the marriage tie. 
Conversely, the man who is moved by a moral feeling to help 
another in difficulty, does not picture to himseUc any reward 
here or hereafter; but pictures only the better condition 
he is trying to bring about. One who is morally prompted 
to fight against a social evil, has neither material benefit 
nor popular applause before his mind; but only the mis- 
chiefs he seeks to remove and the increased well-being 
which will follow their removal. Throughout, then, thej 
moral motive differs from the motives it is associated with ;' 
in this, that instead of being constituted by representations ' 
of incidental, collateral, non-necessary consequences ofj 
acts, it is constituted by representations of consequences ; 
which the acts naturally produce. These representations 
are not all distinct, though some of such are usually present ; 
but they form an assemblage of indistinct representations 
accumulated by experience of the results of like acts in the 
life of the individual, super-posed on a still more indistinct 
but voluminous consciousness due to the inherited effects 
of such experiences in progenitors : formiug a feeling that 
is at once massive and vague. 

And now we see why the moral feelings and corre- 
lative restraints have arisen later than the feelings and 
restraints that originate firom political, rehgious, and social 
authorities; and have so slowly, and even yet so incom- 
pletely, disentangled themselves. For only by these lower 
feelings and restraints could be maintained the conditions 
under which the higher feelings and restraints evolve. It is 
thus alike with the self-regarding feelings and with the 
other-regarding feelings. The pains which improvidence 
will bring, and the pleasures to be gained by storing up 
things for future use and by labouring to get such things, ' 
can be habitually contrasted in thought, only as fast as 
settled social arrangements make accumulation possible; 
and that there may arise such settled arrangements, fear of

the seen ruler, of the unseen ruler, and of public opinion, 
must come into play. Only after political, religious, and 
social restraints have produced a stable community, can 
there be sufficient experience of the pains, positive and 
negative, sensational and emotional, which crimes of aggres- 
sion cause, as to generate that moral aversion to them 
constituted by consciousness of their intrinsically evil 
results. And more manifest still is it that such a moral 
sentiment as that of abstract equity, which is offended not 
only by material injuries done to men but also by poHtical 
arrangements that place them at a disadvantage, can evolve 
only after the social stage reached gives familiar experience 
both of the pains flowing directly from injustices and also 
of those flowing indirectly from the class-privileges which 
make injustices easy. 

That the feelings called moral have the nature and origin 
alleged, is further shown by the fact that we associate the 
name with them in proportion to the degree in which they 
have these characters — firstly of being re-representative; 
secondly of being concerned with indirect rather than with 
direct effects, and generally with remote rather than imme- 
diate; and thirdly of referring to effects that are mostly 
general rather than special. Thus, though we condemn one man 
for extravagance and approve the economy shown by another 
man, we do not class their acts as respectively vicious and 
virtuous : these words are too strong : the present and future 
results here differ too little in concreteness and ideality to 
make the words fully applicable. Suppose, however, that 
the extravagance necessarily brings distress on wife and 
children — brings pains diffused over the lives of others 
as well as of self, and the viciousness of the extravagance 
becomes clear. Suppose, further, that prompted by the wish 
to relieve his family from the misery he has brought on 
them, the spendthrift forges a bill or commits some other 
fraud. Though, estimated apart, we characterize his over- 
ruling emotion as moral, and make allowance for him in

consideration of ifc, yet his action taken as a whole we 
condemn as immoral : we regard as of superior authority, 
the feelings which respond to men's proprietary claims — 
feeKngs which are re-representative in a higher degree 
and refer to more remote diffused consequences. The 
difference, habitually recognized, between the relative 
elevations of justice and generosity, well illustrates 
this truth. The motive causing a generous act has 
reference to efEects of a more concrete, special, and proxi- 
mate kind, than has the motive to do justice; which, 
beyond the proximate effects, usually themselves less 
concrete than those that generosity contemplates, includes a 
consciousness of the distant, involved, diffused effects of 
maintaining equitable relations. / And justice we hold to be 
^,^^ \ higher^enerosityl 

Comprehension of this long argument will be aided by 
here quoting a fiirther passage from the before-named letter 
to Mr. Mill, following the passage already quoted from it. 

" To make my position fnlly understood, it seems needful to add that, 
corresponding to the fundamental propositions of a developed Moral Science, 
there have been, and still are, developing in the race, certain fundamental 
moral intuitions ; and that, though these moral intuitions are the results of 
accumulated experiences of Utility, gradually organized and inherited, they 
have come to be quite independent of conscious experience. Just in the same 
way that I believe the intuition of space, possessed by any living individual, 
to have arisen from organized and consolidated experiences of aU antecedent 
individuals who bequeathed to him their slowly-developed nervous organizations 
•—just as I believe that this intuition, requiring only to be made definite and 
complete by personal experiences, has practically become a form of thought, 
apparently quite independent of experience ; so do I believe that the ex- 
periences of utility organized and consolidated through all past generations of 
the human race, have been producing corresponding nervous modifications, 
which, by continued transmission and accumulation, have become in us certain 
faculties of moral intuition-^K^rtain emotions responding to right and wrong 
conduct, which have no apparent basis in the individual experiences of utility. 
I also hold that just as the space-intuition responds to the exact demonstrations 
of Geometry, and has its rough conclusions interpreted and verified by them ; 
80 will moral Intuitions respond to the demonstrations of Moral Science, and 
will have their rough conclusions interpreted and verified by them." 

To this, in passing, I will add only that the evolution-

hypothesis thus enables us to reconcile opposed moral 
theories, as it enables us to reconcile opposed theories 
of knowledge. For as the doctrine of innate forms 
of intellectual intuition falls into harmony with the ex- 
periential doctrine, when we recognize the production of 
intellectual faculties by inheritance of effects wrought by 
experience ; so the doctrine of innate powers of moral per- 
ception becomes congruous with the utilitarian doctrine, 
I when it is seen that preferences and aversions are rendered 
lorganic by inheritance of the effects of pleasurable and 
painful experiences in progenitors. 

§ 46. One further question has to be answered — How does 
there arise the feeling of moral obligation in general ? Whence 
comes the sentiment of duty, considered as distinct from 
the several sentiments which prompt temperance, providence, 
kindness, justice, truthfulness, &c. ? The answer is that it 
is an abstract sentiment generated in a manner analogous to 
that in which abstract ideas are generated. 

The idea of each colour had originally entire concreteness 
given to it by an object possessing the colour ; as some of 
the unmodified names, such as orange and violet, show us. 
The dissociation of each . colour from the object specially 
associated with it in thought at the outset, went on as fast 
as the colour came to be associated in thought with objects 
unlike the first, and unlike one another. The idea of orange 
was conceived in the abstract more fully in proportion as the 
various orange-coloured objects remembered, cancelled one 
another's diverse attributes, and left outstanding their com- 
mon attribute. So is it if we ascend a stage and 
note how there arises the abstract idea of colour apart from 
particular colours. Were aU things red the conception of 
colour in the abstract could not exist. Imagine that every 
object was either red or green, and it is manifest that the 
mental habit would be to think of one or other of these two 
colours in connexion with anything named. But multiply

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. 125 

the colours so that thought rambles undecidedly among the 
ideas of them that occur along with any object named^ and 
there results the notion of indeterminate colour — the 
common property which objects possess of affecting us by 
light from their surfaces, as well as by their forms. For 
evidently the notion, of this common property is that which 
remains constant while imagination is picturing every pos- 
sible variety of colour. It is the uniform trait in all coloured 
things ; that is — colour in the abstract. Words 

referring to quantity furnish cases of more marked dis- 
sociation of abstract from concrete. Grouping various 
things as small in comparison either with those of their 
kind or with those of other kinds ; and similarly grouping 
some objects as comparatively great ; we get the opposite 
abstract notions of smallness and greatness. Applied as 
these are to innumerable very diverse things— not objects 
only, but forces, times, numbers, values, — ^they have become 
so little connected with concretes, that their abstract 
meanings are very vague. Further, we must 

note that an abstract idea thus formed often acquires an 
illusive independence ; as we may perceive in the case of 
motion, which, dissociated in thought from all particular 
bodies and velocities and directiojas, is sometimes referred 
to as though it could be conceived apart from something 
moviug. Now all this holds of the subjective as 

well as of the objective ; and among other states of con- 
sciousness, holds of the emotions as known by introspection. 
By the grouping of those re-representative feelings above 
described, which, differing among themselves in other 
respects have a component in common; and by the con- 
sequent mutual cancelling of their diverse components ; this 
common component is made relatively appreciable, and 
becomes an abstract feeling. Thus is produced the senti« 
ment of moral obligation or duty. Let us observe its genesis. 
We have seen that during the progress of animate 
existence, the later-evolved, more compound and more re-

presentafcive feelings, serving to adjust the conduct to more 
distant and general needs, have all along had an authority 
as guides superior to that of the earlier and simpler feelings 
—excluding cases in which these last are intense. This 
superior authority, unrecognizable by lower types of 
creatures which cannot generalize, and little recognizable by 
primitive men, who have but feeble powers of generalization, 
has become distinctly recognized as civilization and accom- 
panying mental development have gone on. Accumulated 
experiences have produced the consciousness that guidance 
by feelings which refer to remote and general results, is 
usually more conducive to welfare than guidance by feeKngs 
to be immediately gratified. For what is the common 
character of the feeUngs that prompt honesty, truthfulness, 
diligence, providence, &c., which men habitually find to 
be better prompters than the appetites and simple im- 
pulses ? They are all complex, re-representative feelings, 
occupied with the future rather than the present. The idea 
of authorifcativeness has therefore come to be connected with 
feelings having these traits : the implication being that the 
lower and simpler feelings are without authority. And this 
idea of authoritativeness is one element in the abstract con- 
sciousness of duty. 

But there is another element— the element of coercive- 
ness. This originates from experience of those several 
forms of restraint that have, as above described, established 
themselves in the course of civilization — ^the political, re- 
ligious, and social. To the efiects of punishments inflicted 
by law and public opinion on conduct of certain kinds. 
Dr. Bain ascribes the feeling of moral obligation. And I 
agree with him to the extent of thinking that by them is 
generated the sense of compulsion which the consciousness 
of duty includes, and which the word obligation indicates. 
The existence of an earlier and deeper element, gene- 
rated as above described, is however, I think, impHed 
by the fact that certain of the higher self-regarding 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW. 127 

feelings, instigating prudence and economy, have a moral 
authority in opposition to the simpler self-regarding feelings : 
showing that apart from any thought of factitious penalties 
on improvidence, the feeling constituted by representation 
of the natural penalties has acquired an acknowledged 
superiority. But accepting in the main the view that fears 
of the political and social penalties (to which, I think, the 
religious must be added) have generated that sense of 
coerciveness which goes along with the thought of post- 
poning present to future and personal desires to the claims 
of others, it here chiefly concerns us to note that this sense 
of coerciveness becomes indirectly connected with the 
feelings distinguished as moral. For since the political, 
religious, and social restraining motives, are mainly formed of 
represented future results ; and since the moral restraining 
motive is mainly formed of represented future results ; it 
happens that the representations, having much in common, 
and being often aroused at the same time, the fear joined 
with three sets of them becomes, by association, joined with 
the fourth. Thinking of the extrinsic effects of a forbidden 
act, excites a dread which continues present while the in- 
trinsic effects of the act are thought of; and being thus 
linked with these intrinsic effects causes a vague sense of 
moral compulsion. Emerging as the moral motive does but 
slowly from amidst the political, religious, and social 
motives, it long participates in that consciousness of sub- 
ordination to some external agency which is joined with 
them; and only as it becomes distinct and predominant 
does it lose this associated consciousness — only then does 
the feeling of obligation fade. 

This remark implies the tacit conclusion, which will be to 
most very startling, that the sense of duty or moral obli- 
gation is transitory, and will diminish as fast as moralization 
increases. StartHng though it is, this conclusion may be 
satisfactorily defended. Even now progress towards the 
implied ultimate state is traceable. The observation is not

infrequent that persistence in performing a duty ends in 
making it a pleasure ; and this amounts to the admission 
that while at first the motive contains an element of coercion, 
at last this element of coercion dies out^ and the act is 
performed without any consciousness of being obliged to 
perform it. The contrast between the youth on whom dili- 
gence is enjoined, and the man of business so absorbed in 
afiairs that he cannot be induced to relax, shows us how the 
doing of work, originally under the consciousness that it 
ought to be done, may eventually cease to have any such 
accompanying consciousness. Sometimes, indeed, the relation 
comes to be reversed ; and the man of business persists in 
work from pure love of it when told that he ought not. 
Nor is it thus with self-regarding feeKngs only. That the 
maintaining and protecting of wife by, husband often result 
solely from feelings directly gratified by these actions, with- 
out any thought of mtist ; and that the fostering of children 
by parents is in many cases made an absorbing occupation 
without any coercive feeling of ought ; are obvious truths 
which show us that even now, with some of the fundamental 
other-regarding duties, the sense of obligation has retreated 
into the background of the mind. And it is in some degree 
so with other-regarding duties of a higher kind. Conscien- 
tiousness has in many out-grown that stage in which the 
sense of a compelling power is joined with rectitude of 
action. The truly honest man, here and there to be found, 
is not only without thought of legal, religious, or social 
compulsion, when he discharges an equitable claim on him ; 
but he is without thought of seK-compulsion. He does 
the iight thing with a simple feeling of satisfaction in doing 
it ; and is, indeed, impatient if anything prevents him from 
having the satisfaction of doing it. 

Evidently, then, with complete adaptation to the social 
state, that element in the moral consciousness which is ex- 
pressed by the word obligation, will disappear. The higher 
actions required for the harmonious carrying on of life.

will be as much matters of course as are those lower actions 
which the simple desires prompt. In their proper times and 
places and proportions, the moral sentiments will guide 
men just as spontaneously and adequately as now do the 
sensations. And though, joined with their regulating in- 
fluence when this is called for, will exist latent ideas of the 
evils which nonconformity would bring; these will occupy 
the mind no more than do ideas of the evils of starvation 
at the time when a healthy appetite is being satisfied by 
a meal. 

§ 47. This elaborate exposition, which the extreme com- 
plexity of the subject has necessitated, may have its leading 
ideas re-stated thus : — 

Symbolizing by a, and 6, related phenomena in the envi- 
ronment, which in some way concern the welfare of the 
organism; and symbolizing by c and d, the impressions, 
simple or compound, which the organism receives from the 
one, and the motions, single or combined, by which its acts 
are adapted to meet the other ; we saw that psychology in 
general is concerned with the connexion between the relation 
a h and the relation c d. Further, we saw that by impli- 
cation the psychological aspect of Ethics, is that aspect 
under which the adjustment of c d to ab, appears, not as an 
intellectual co-ordination simply, but as a co-ordination 
in which pleasures and pains are alike factors and results. 

It was .shown that throughout Evolution, motive and 
act become more complex, as the adaptation of inner 
related actions to outer related actions extends in range 
and variety. Whence followed the corollary that the 
later-evolved feelings, more representative and re-repre- 
eentative in their constitution, and referring to remoter 
and wider needs, have, on the average, an authority as 
guides greater than have the earlier and simpler feelings. 

After thus observing that even an inferior creature is 
ruled by a hierarchy of feelings so constituted that general

welfare depends on a certain subordination of lower to 
higher^ we saw that in man, as lie passes into the social 
fitate^ there arises the need for sundry additional subordina- 
tions of lower to higher : co-operation being made possible 
only by them. To the restraints constituted by mental 
jrepresentations of the intrinsic effects of actions, which, 
in their simpler forms, have been evolving from the 
beginning, are added the restraints caused by mental repre- 
sentations of extrinsic effects, in the shape of political, 
religious, and social penalties. 

With the evolution of society, made possible by institu- 
tions maintaining order, and associating in men's "ttnds 
the sense of obligation with prescribed acts and with 
desistances from forbidden acts, there arose opportunities for 
! seeing the bad consequences naturally flowing from the 
I conduct interdicted and the good consequences from the 
I conduct required. Hence eventually grew up moral 
aversions and approvals : experience of the intrinsic effects 
necessarily here coming later than experience of the extrinsic 
effects, and therefore producing its results later. 

The thoughts and feelings constituting these moral 
aversions and approvals, being all along closely connected 
with the thoughts and feelings constituting fears of political, 
religious, and social penalties, necessarily came to participate 
in the accompanying sense of obligation. The coercive 
dement in the consciousness of duties at large, evolved by - 
converse with external agencies which enforce duties, diffused 
itself by association through that consciousness of duty, pro- 
perly called moral, which is occupied with intrinsic results 
instead of extrinsic results. 

But this self-compulsion, which at a relatively-high stage 
becomes more and more a substitute for compulsion from 
without, must itself, at a still higher stage, practically dis- 
appear. If some action to which the special motive is 
insufficient, is performed in obedience to the feeling of moral 
obligation, the fact proves that the special faculty con-

cemed is not yet equal to itsfanction — ^lias not acquired suoh 
strengtli that the required activity has become its normal 
activity, yielding its due amount of pleasure. With complete 
evolution then, the sense of obligation, not ordinarily present 
in consciousness, will be awakened only on those extra- 
ordinary occasions that prompt breach of the laws otherwise 
spontaneously conformed to. 

And this brings us to the psychological aspect of that 
conclusion which, in the last chapter, was reached under its 
biological aspect. The pleasures and pains which the moral ^ 
sentiments originate, will, like bodily pleasures and pains, 
become incentives and deterrents so adjusted in their 
strengths to the needs, that the moral conduct will be the 
natural conduct*

CHAPTER Vm. 

THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 

§ 48. Not for the human race only, but for every race, 
there are laws of right living. Given its environment and 
its structure, and there is for each kind of creature a 
set of actions adapted in their kinds, amounts, and combi- 
nations, to secure the highest conservation its nature 
permits. The animal, like the man, has needs for food, 
warmth, activity, rest, and so forth ; which must be fulfilled 
in certain relative degrees to make its life whole. Main- 
tenance of its race implies satisfaction of special desires, 
sexual and philoprogenitive, in due proportions. Hence 
there is a supposable formula for the activities of each 
species, which, could it be drawn out, would constitute a 
system of morality for that species. But such a system 
of morality would have little or no reference to the 
welfare of others than self and ofEspring. Indifierent to 
individuals of its own kind, as an inferior creature is, and 
habitually hostile to individuals of other kinds, the formula 
for its life could take no cognizance of the lives of those 
with which it came in contact; or rather, such formula 
would imply that maintenance of its life was at variance 
with maintenance of their lives. 

But on ascending from beings of lower kinds to the 
highest kind of being, man ; or, more strictly, on ascending

THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 133 

from man in his pro-social stage to man in liis social stage ; 
the formula has to include an additional factor. Though 
not peculiar to human life under its developed form, the 
presence of this factor is still, in the highest degree, 
characteristic of it. Though there are inferior species 
displaying considerable degrees of sociality; and though 
the formulas for their complete lives would have to take 
account of the relations arising from union ; yet our own 
species is, on the whole, to be distinguished as having a 
formula for complete life which specially recognizes the 
relations of each individual to others, in presence of whom, 
and in co-operation with whom, he has to live. 

This additional factor in the problem of complete living, 
is, indeed, so important that the necessitated modifications 
of conduct have come to form a chief part of the code 
of conduct. Because the inherited desires which directly 
refer to the maintenance of individual life, are fairly 
adjusted to the requirements, there has been no need U> 
insist on that conformity to them which furthers self- 
conservation. Conversely, because these desires prompt 
activities that often conflict with the activities of others; 
and because the sentiments responding to other's claims 
are relatively weak ; moral codes emphasize those restraints 
on conduct which the presence of fellow men entails. 

From the sociological point of view, then. Ethics 
becomes nothing else than a definite account of the forms 
of conduct that are fitted to the associated state, in such 
wise that the lives of each and all may be the greatest 
possible, alike in length and breadth. 

§ 49. But here we are met by a fact which forbids us thus 
to put in the foreground the welfares of citizens, individually 
considered, and requires us to put in the foreground the 
welfare of the society as a whole. The life of the social 
organism must, as an end, rank above the Kves of its 
units. These two ends are not harmonious at the outset; 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



134 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

and though the tendency is towards harmonization of them, 
they are still partially conflicting. 

As fast as the social state establishes itself, the pre- 
servation of the society becomes a means of preserving 
its units. Living together arose because, on the average, it 
proved more advantageous to each than living apart ; and 
this implies that maintenance of combination is maintenance 
of the conditions to more satisfactory living than the com- 
bined persons would otherwise have. Hence, social self- 
preservation becomes a proximate aim taking precedence of 
the ultimate aim, individual self-preservation. 

This subordination of personal to social welfare is, how- 
ever, contingent : it depends on the presence of antagonistic 
societies. So long as the existence of a community is 
endangered by the actions of communities around, it must 
remain true that the interests of individuals must be sacri- 
ficed to the interests of the community, as far as is needful 
for the community's salvation. But if this is manifest, it is, 
by implication, manifest, that when social antagonisms cease, 
this need for sacrifice of private claims to public claims 
ceases also ; or rather, there cease to be any public claims at 
variance with private claims. All along, furtherance of indi- 
vidual lives has been the ultimate end : and if this ultimate 
end has been postponed to the proximate end of preserving 
the community's life, it has been so only because this proxi- 
mate end was instrumental to the ultimate end. When the 
aggregate is no longer in danger, the final object of pursuit, 
the welfare of the units, no longer needing to be postponed, 
becomes the immediate object of pursuit. 

Consequently, unlike sets of conclusions respecting human 
conduct emerge, according as we are concerned with a state 
of habitual or occasional war, or are concerned with a state 
of permanent and general peace. Let us glance at these 
alternative states and the alternative implications. 

§ 50. At present the individual man has to cany on his

life with due regard to the lives of others belonging to the 
same society; while he is sometimes called on to be 
regardless of the lives of those belonging to other societies. 
The same mental constitution having to fulfil both these 
requirements, is necessarily incongruous; and tiie correlative 
conduct, adjusted first to the one need and then to the other, 
cannot be brought within any consistent ethical system. 

Hate and destroy your fellow man, is now the command ; 
and then the command is, love and aid your fellow man. Use 
every means to deceive, says the one code of conduct ; while 
the other code says, be truthful in word and deed. Seize 
what property you can and bum all you cannot take away, 
are injunctions which the religion of enmity countenances ; 
while by the religion of amity, theft and arson are con- 
demned as crimes. And as conduct has to be made up of 
.parts thus at variance with one another, the theory of 
conduct remains confused. There co-exists a 

kindred irreconcilability between the sentiments answering 
to the forms of co-operation required for militancy and 
industrialism respectively. While social antagonisms are 
habitual, and while, for efficient action against other societies, 
there needs great subordination to men who command, the 
virtue of loyalty and the duty of implicit obedience have to ^ 
be insisted on : disregard of the ruler^s will is punished with 
death. But when war ceases to be chronic, and growing 
industrialism habituates men to maintaining their own 
claims while respecting the claims of others, loyalty becomes 
iess profound, the authority of the ruler is questioned or 
denied in respect of various private actions and beliefs, 
State-dictation is in many directions successfully defied, 
and the poKtical independence of the citizen comes to bo • 
regarded as a claim which it is virtuous to maintain and 
vicious to yield up. Necessarily during the transition, these ' 
opposite sentiments are incongruously mingled. So 

b it, too, with domestic institutions under the two regimes^ •*

able, and in the slave submission is praiseworthy j but as 
the last grows dominant, slave-owning becomes a crime and 
servile obedience excites contempt. Nor is it otherwise 
in the family. The subjection of women to men, complete 
while war is habitual but qualified as fast as peaceful occupa- 
tions replace it, comes eventually to be thought wrong; 
and equality before the law is asserted. At the same time 
the opinion concerning paternal power changes. The once 
unquestioned right of the father to take his children's lives is 
denied; and the duty of absolute submission to him, long 
insisted on, is changed into the duty of obedience within 
reasonable limits. 

Were the ratio between the life of antagonism with alien 
societies, and the life of peaceful co-operation within each 
society, a constant ratio, some permanent compromise between 
the conflicting rules of conduct appropriate to the two lives 
might be reached. But since this ratio is a variable one, 
the compromise can never be more than temporary. Ever 
the tendency is towards congruity between beliefs and 
requirements. Either the social arrangements are gradually 
changed until they come into harmony with prevailing ideas 
and sentiments; or, if surrounding conditions prevent 
change in the social arrangements, the necessitated habits 
of life modify the prevailing ideas and sentiments to the 
requisite extent. Hence, for each kind and degree of social 
evolution determined by external conflict and internal 
friendship, there is an appropriate compromise between 
the mor^ code of enmity and the moral code of amity j^^ 
not, indeed, a definable, consistent compromise, but a com- 
promise -fairly well understood. 

This compromise, vague, ambiguous, illogical, though it 
may be, is nevertheless for the time being authoritative. 
For if, as above shown, the welfare of the socieiy 
must take precedence of the welfares of its component 
individuals, during those stages in which the individuals have 
to preserve themselves by preserving their society ; then

such temporaTy compromise between the two codes of con- 
duct as duly regards external defence, while favouring 
iuternal co-operation to the greatest extent practicable, 
subserves the maintenance of life in the highest degree ; 
and thus gains the ultimate sanction. So that the perplexed 
and inconsistent moralities of which each society and each age I 
shows us a more or less different one, are severally justified / 
as beiQg approximately the best under the circumstances. 

But such moralities are, by their definitions, shown to 
belong to incomplete conduct ; not to conduct that is fully - 
evolved. We saw that the adjustments of acts to ends which, 
while constituting the external manifestations of life conduce 
to the continuance of life, have been rising to a certain 
ideal form now approached by the civilized man. But this 
form is not reached so long as there continue aggressions of 
one society upon another. Whether the hindrances to com- 
plete living result from the trespasses of fellow-citizens, or 
from the trespasses of aliens, matters not: if they occur there 
does not yet exist the state defined. The limit to the evolu- 
tion* of conduct is arrived at by the members of each society 
only when, being arrived at by members of other societies 
also, the causes of international antagonism end simulta- 
neously with the causes of antagonism between individuals. 

And now having from the sociological point of view 
recognized the need for, and authority of, these changing 
systems of ethics, proper to changing ratios between war- 
like activities and peaceful activities, we have, from the same 
point of view, to consider the system of ethics proper to the 
state in which peaceful activities are undisturbed^^,^,---'""'^ 

§ 51. If, excluding all thought of dangers or hindrances ' 
from causes external to a society, we set ourselves to specify 
those conditions under which the life of each person, and 
therefore of the aggregate, may be the greate'fet possible; 
we come upon certain simple ones which, as here stated^ 
assume the form c^ truisms.

For, as we have seen, the definition of that highest life 
accompanying completely-evolved conduct, itself excludes 
all acts of aggression — not only murder, assault, robbery 
and the major ofEences generally, but minor offences, such 
as libel, injury to property and so forth. While directly 
deducting from individual life, these indirectly cause pertur- 
bations of social life. Trespasses against others rouse anta- 
gonisms in them ; and if these are numerous the group 
loses coherence. Hence, whether the integrity of the group 
itself is considered as the end; or whether the end con- 
sidered is the benefit ultimately secured to its units by 
maintaining its integrity ; or whether the immediate benefit 
of its units taken separately, is considered the end; the 
implication is the same: such acts are at variance with 
achievement of the end. That these inferences are self- 
evident and trite (as indeed the first inferences drawn from 
the data of every science that reaches the deductive stage 
naturally are) must not make us pass lightly over the all- 
important fact that, from the sociological point of view, 
the leading moral laws are seen to follow as corollaries 
firom the definition of complete life carried on under social 
conditions. 

Eespect for these primary moral laws is not enough, 
however. Associated men pursuing their several lives 
without injuring one another but without helping one 
another, reap no advantages from association beyond 
those of companionship. If, while there is no co-operation 
for defensive purposes (which is here excluded by the 
hypothesis) there is also no co-operation for satisfying 
wants, the social state loses its raison d'etre — almost, 
if not entirely. There are, indeed, people who live in a 
condition little removed from this ; as the Esquimaux. > 
But though these, exhibiting none of the co-operation 
necessitated by war, which is unknown to them, lead lives 
such that each family is substantially independent of others, 
occasional co-operation occurs. And, indeed, that families

THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 139 

should live in company without ever yielding mntoal aid^ 
is scarcely conceivable. 

Nevertheless, whether actually existing or only approached^ 
we must here recognize as hypothetically possible, a state in 
which these primary moral laws alone are conformed to ; for 
the purpose of observing, in their uncomplicated forms, what 
are the negative conditions to harmonious social life. Whe- 
ther the members of a social group do or do not co-operate, 
certain limitations to their individual activities are necessi- : 
tated by their association ; and after recognizing these as 
. arising in the absence of co-operation, we shall be the better 
prepared to understand how conformity to them is effected 
when co-operation begins. 

§ 52. For whether men live together in quite independent 
ways, careful only to avoid aggressing ; or whether, advancing 
from passive association to active association, they co- 
operate; their conduct must be such that the achievement i 
of ends by each shall at least not be hindered. And 
it becomes obvious that when they co-operate, there 
must not only be no resulting hindrance but there must 
be facilitation ; since in the absence of facilitation there can 
be no motive to co-operate. What shape, then, must the 
mutual restraints take when co-operation begins ? or rather — 
What, in addition to the primary mutual restraints already 
specified, are those secondary mutual restraints required to 
make co-operation possible ? 

One who, living in an isolated way, expends effort in 
pursuit of an end, gets compensation for the effort by secur- 
ing the end ; and so achieves satis^tion. If he expends 
the effort without achieving the end, there results dissatis- 
faction. The satisfaction and the dissatisfaction, are mea- 
sures of success and failure in life-sustaining acts; since 
that which is achieved by effort is something which directly 
or indirectly furthers life, and so pays for the cost of the 
effort ; while if the effort fails there is nothing to pay for the

140 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

cost of it^ and so mucli life is wasted. What mnst result 
from tliis when men^s efforts are joined ? The reply will be 
made clearer if we take the successive forms of co-operation 
in the order of ascending complexity. We may distinguish 
as homogeneous co-operation, (1), that in which like efforts 
are joined for like ends that are simultaneously enjoyed. As 
co-operation that is not completely homogeneous, we may 
•distinguish, (2), tltat in which like efforts are joined for like 
ends that are not simultaneously enjoyed. A co-operation of 
which the heterogeneity is more distinct is, (3), that in which 
unlike efforts are joined for like ends. And lastly comes * 
the decidedly heterogeneous co-operation, (4), that in which - 
unlike efforts are joined for unlike ends. 

The simplest and earliest of these, in which men's powers, 
similar in kind and degree, are united in pursuit of a benefit 
which, when obtained, they all participate in, is most fami- 
liarly exemplified in the catching of game by primitive * 
men : this simplest and earliest form of industrial co-operation 
being also that which is least differentiated from militant co- 
operation ; for the co-operators are the same, and the pro- 
cesses, both destructive of life, are carried on in analogous 
ways. The condition under which such co-operation may 
be successfully carried on, is that the co-operators shall 
share alike in the produce. Bach thus being enabled to 
repay himself in food for the expended effort, and being 
further enabled to achieve other such desired ends as main- 
tenance of family, obtains satisfaction : there is no aggression 
of one on another, and the co-operation is harmonious. Of 
course the divided produce can be but roughly proportioned 
to the several efforts joined in obtaining it ; but there is 
actually among savages, as we see that for harmonious co- 
operation there must be, a recognition of the principle that 
efforts when combined shall severally bring equivalent bene- 
fits, as they would do if they were separate. Moreover, 
beyond the taking equal shares in return for labours that 
are approximately equal, there is generally an attempt 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 141 

at proportioning benefit to achievement, by assigning some- 
thing extra, in the shape of the best part or the trophy, to 
the actual slayer of the game. And obviously, if there is a 
wide departure from this system of sharing benefits when 
there has been a sharing of efforts, the co-operation will 
cease. Individual hunters will prefer to do the best they • 
can for themselves separately. 

Passing from this simplest case of co*operation to a case 
not quite so simple — a case in which the homogeneity is 
mcomplete — let us ask how a member of the group may be 
led without dissatisfaction to expend efibrt in achieving a 
benefit which, when achieved, is enjoyed exclusively by 
another ? Clearly he may do this on condition that the other 
shall afterwards expend a like efibrt, the beneficial result of * 
which shall be similarly rendered up by him in return. This 
exchange of equivalents of efibrt is the form which social co- 
operation takes while yet there is little or no division of labour 
save that between the sexes. For example, the Bodo and 
Dhimals ^' mutually assist each other for the nonce, as well in 
constructing their houses as in clearing their plots for culti- 
vation.^' And this principle — ^I will help you if you will 
help me — common in simple communities where the occupa- 
tions are alike in kind, and occasionally acted upon in more 
advanced communities, is one under which the relation 
between efibrt and benefit, no longer directly maintained, is 
maintained indirectly. For whereas when men's activities 
are carried on separately, or are joined in the way 
exemplified above, efibrt is immediately paid for by benefit, 
in this form of co-operation the benefit achieved by efibrt is 
exchanged for a like benefit to be afterwards received when 
asked for. And in this case as in the preceding case, co- 
operation can be maintained only by fulfilment of the tacit . 
agreements. For if they are habitually not fulfilled, there 
wiU commonly be refusal to give aid when asked ; and each 
man will be left to do the best he can by himself. All those 
advantages to be gained by union of effbrts in doing

things that are beyond the powers of the single individual^ 
will be unachievable. At the outset, then, fulfilment of 
contracts that are implied if not expressed^ becomes a 
condition to social co-operation; and therefore to social 
development. 

From these simple forms of co-operation in which the 
labours men carry on are of like kinds, let us turn to the more 
complex forms in which they carry on labours of unlike t 
kinds. Where men mutually aid in building huts or felling 
trees, the number of days^ work now given by one to 
another, is readily balanced by an equal number of days' 
work afterwards given by the other to him. And no esti- 
mation of the relative values of the labours being required, 
a definite understanding is little needed. But when division 
of labour arises — ^when there come transactions between 
one who makes weapons and another who dresses skins for 
clothing, or between a grower of roots and a catcher of fish 
— ^neither the relative amounts nor the relative qualities of 
their labours admit of easy measure; and with the 
multiplication of businesses, implying numerous kinds of 
skill and power, there ceases to be anything like manifest 
equivalence between either the bodily and mental efforts set 
against one another, or between their products. Hence the 
arrangement cannot now be taken for granted, as while the 
thiugs exchanged are like in kind : it has to be stated. If 
A allows B to appropriate a product of his special skill, on 
condition that he is allowed to appropriate a different pro- 
duct of B's special skill, it results that as equivalence of the 
two products cannot be determined by direct comparison of 
their quantities and qualities, there must be a distinct 
understanding as to how much of the one may be takei:i in ' 
consMui'tiiiiyii of so much of the other. 

Only under voluntary agreement, then, no longer tacit 
and vague but overt and definite, can co-operation be 
harmoniously carried on when division of labour becomes 
established. And as in the simplest co-operation, where like

THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 143 

efforts are joined to secure a common good, the dissatisfac- 
tion caused in those who, having expended their labours do 
not get their shares of the good, prompts them to cease 
co-operating; as in the more advanced co-operation, 
achieved by exchanging equal labours of like kind expended 
at different times, aversion to co-operate is generated 
if the expected equivalent of labour is not rendered; 
so in this developed co-operation, the failure of either to sur- 
render to the other that which was avowedly recognized' as 
of like value with the labour or product given, tends to 
prevent co-operation by exciting discontent with its results. 
And evidently, while antagonisms thus caused impede the 
lives of the units, the life of the aggregate is endangered 
by diminished cohesion. 

§ 53. Beyond these comparatively direct mischiefis, 
special and general, there have to be noted indirect mis- 
chiefs. As already implied by the reasoning in the last 
paragraph, not only social integration but also social differen- 
tiation, is hindered by breach of contract. 

In Part II of the Pri/nciplea of Sociology, it was shown 
that the fundamental principles of organization are the 
same for an individual organism and for a social organism ; 
because both consist of mutually-dependent parts. In the 
one case as in the other, the assumption of unlike activities 
by the component members, is possible only on condition that 
they severally benefit. in due degrees by one another's 
activities. Tb&t we may the better see what are the impli- 

I cations in respect of social structures, let us first note the 
implications in respect of individual structures. 
The welfare of a living body impKes an approximate 

* equilibrium between waste and repair. If th^ jictivities 
involve an expenditure not made good by nutrition, 
dwindling follows. If the tissues are enabled to take up 

. from the blood enriched by food, fit substances enough to 
replace those used up in efforts made, the weight may be 
maintained. And if the gain exceeds the loss, growth

results. That wliicli is truo of tlie whole in its 

relations to the external worlds is no less true of the parts 
in their relations to one another. Each organ, like the 
entire organism, is wasted by performing its function, and 
has to restore itself from the materials brought to it. If 
the quantity of materials furnished by the joint agency of 
the other organs is deficient, the particular organ dwindles. 
If they are suflScient, it can maintain its integrity. If they 
are in excess, it is enabled to increase. To say that this 
arrangement constitutes the physiological contract, is to - 
use a metaphor which, though not true in aspect is true in 
essence. For the relations of structures are actually such 
that, by the help of a central regulative system, each 
organ is supplied with blood in proportion to the work it 
does. As was pointed out {Principles of Sociology^ § 254) 
well-developed animals are so constituted that each muscle 
or viscus, when called into action, sends to the vaso-motor 
centres through certain nerve-fibres, an impulse caused by 
its action; whereupon through other nerve-fibres, there 
comes an impulse causing dilatation of its blood-vessels. That 
is to say, all other parts of the organism when they jointly 
require it to labour, forthwith begin to pay it in blood. 
During the ordinary state of physiological equilibrium, the 
loss and the gain balance, and the organ does not sensibly 
change. If the amount of its function is increased within 
such moderate limits that the local blood-vessels can bring 
adequately-increased supplies, the organ grows : beyond 
replacing its losses by its gains, it makes a profit on its 
extra transactions ; so being enabled by extra structures to 
meet extra demands. But if the demands made on it 
become so great that the supply of materials cannot keep pace 
with the expenditure, either because the local blood-vessels are 
not large enough or for any other reason ; then the organ 
begins to decrease from excess of waste over repair : there 
sets in what is known as atrophy. Now since each of the 
organs has thus to be paid in nutriment for its services by 
the rest; it follows that the due balancing of their 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. .145 

respective claims and payments is requisite, directly for tlie 
welfare, of each organ, and indirectly for the welfare of the 
organism. For in a whole formed of mutually-dependent 
parts, anything which prevents due performance of its duty * 
by one part reacts injuriously on all the parts. 

With change of terms these statements and inferences ► 
hold of a society. That social division of labour which 
parallels in so many other respects the physiological 
division of labour, parallels it in this respect also. As 
was shown at large in the Principles of Sociolopy, Part II, 
each order of functionaries and each group of pro- 
ducers, severally performing some action or making 
some article not for direct satisfaction of their own 
needs but for satisfaction of the needs of fellow-citizens 
in general, otherwise occupied, can continue to do this 
only so long as the expenditures of effort and returns . 
of profit are approximately equivalent. Social organs 
like individual organs remain stationary if there come 
to them normal proportions of the commodities produced 
by the society as a whole. If because the demands 
made on an industry or profession are unusually great, 
those engaged in it make excessive profits, more citizens 
flock to it and the social structure constituted by its 
members grows; while decrease of the demands and 
therefore of the profits, either leads its members to 
choose other careers or stops the accessions needful 
to replace those who die, and the structure dwindles. 
Thus is maintained that proportion among the powers 
of the component parts which is most conducive to the 
welfare of the whole. 

And now mark that the primary condition to achieve- j 
ment of this result is fulfilment of contract. If from 
the members of any part payment is frequently withheld, 
or falls short of the promised amount, then, through ruin 
of some and abandonment of the occupation by others, 
the part diminishes j and if it was before not more than

146 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

competent to its duty, it now becomes incompetent, and the 
society suffers. Or if social needs throw On some part 
great increase of function, and the members of it are enabled 
to get for their services unusually high prices; fulfilment 
of the agreements to give them these high prices, is the 
only way of drawing to the part such additional number 
of members as will make it equal to the angmented 
demands. For citizens will not come to it if they find 
the high prices agreed upon are not paid. 

Briefly, then, the universal basis of co-operation is the 
proportioning of benefits received to services rendered. 
Without this there can be no physiological division of labour; 
without this there can be no sociological division of labour. 
And since division of labour, physiological or sociological, 
profits the whole and each part ; it results that on mainte- 
nance of the arrangements necessary to it, depend both 
special and general welfare. In a society such arrangements 
are maintained only if bargains, overt or tacit, are carried 
out. So that beyond the primary requirement to harmonious 
co-existence in a society, that its units shall not directly 
aggress on one another ; there comes this secondary require- 
ment, that they shall not indirectly aggress by breaking 
agreements. 

§ 54. But now we have to recognize the fact that complete 
fulfilment of these conditions, original and derived, is not 
enough. Social co-operation may be such that no one is 
impeded in the obtainment of the normal return for 
effort, but contrariwise is aided by equitable exchange 
of services; and yet much may remain to be achieved. 
There is a theoretically-possible form of society, purely 
industrial in its activities, which, though approaching nearer 
to the moral ideal • in its code of conduct than any society 
not purely industrial, does not fully reach it. 

For while industrialism requires the life of each citizen 
to be such tllat it may be carried on without direct or 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIB^'. 147 

indirect aggressions on other citizens, it does not require 
his life to be such that it shall directly further the lives 
of other citizens. It is not a necessary implication of 
industrialism, as thus far defined, that each, beyond the 
benefits given and received by exchange of services, shall 
give and receive other benefits. A society is conceivable 
formed of men leading perfectly inoffensive hves, scru- 
pulously fulfilling their contracts, and efficiently rearing 
their ofi'spring, who yet, yielding to one another no 
advantages beyond those agreed upon, fall short of that 
highest degree of life which the gratuitous rendering of 
services makes possible. Daily experiences prove tl\at every 
oneVould sufier many evils and lose many goods, did none 
give him xmpaid assistance. The life of each would be more 
or less damaged had he to meet all contingencies single- 
handed. Further, if no one did for his fellows anything 
more than was required by strict performance of contract, 
private interests would suffer from the absence of attention ' 
to public interests. The limit of evolution of conduct is 
consequently not reached, until, beyond avoidance of direct 
and indirect injuries to others, there are spontaneous efforts 
to further the welfare of others. 

It may be shown that the form of nature which thus 
to justice adds beneficence, is one which adaptation to 
the social state produces. The social man has not 
reached that harmonization of constitution with con- 
ditions forming the limit of evolution, so long as there 
remains space for the growth of faculties which, by their 
exercise, bring positive benefit to others and satisfaction to 
self. If the presence of fellow-men, while putting certain 
limits to each man^s sphere of activity, opens certain 
other spheres of activity in which feelings while achieving 
their gratifications, do not diminish but add to the gratifi- 
cations of others, then such spheres will inevitably be 
occupied. Recognition of this truth does not, however, call 
on us to qualify greatly that conception of the industrial

state above set forth; since sympathy fs the root of both 
justice and beneficence. 

§ 55. Thus the sociological view of Ethics supplements 
the physical, the biological, and the psychological views, by 
, disclosing those conditions under which alone associated 
activities can be so carried on, that the complete living of 
each consists with, and conduces to, the complete living 
of all. 

At first the welfare of social groups, habitually in 
antagonism with other such groups, takes precedence of 
individual welfare; and the rules of conduct which are 
authoritative for the time being, involve incompleteness of 
individual life that the general life may be maintained. At 
the same time the rules have to enforce the claims of indi- 
vidual life as far as may be ; since on the welfere of the 
units the welfare of the aggregate largely depends. 

In proportion as societies endanger one another less, 
the need for subordinating individual lives to the general 
life, decreases ; and with approach to a peaceful state, the 
general life, having from the beginning had furtherance of 
individual lives as its ultimate purpose, comes to have this 
as its proximate purpose. 

During the transitional stages there are necessitated suc- 
cessive compromises between the moral code which asserts 
the claims of the society versus those of the individual, 
and the moral code which asserts the claims of the indivi- 
dual versus those of the society. And evidently each such 
compromise, though for the time being authoritative, admits 
of no consistent or definite expression. 

But gradually as war declines — gradually as the compulsory 
co-operation needful in dealing with external enemies becomes 
unnecessary, and leaves behind the voluntary co-operation 
which efiectually achieves internal sustentation ; there grows 
increasingly clear the code of conduct which voluntary co- 
operation implies. And this final permanent code alone admits 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW. 149 

of being definitely formulated, and so constituting ethics as 
a science in contrast with empirical ethics. 

The leading traits of a code under which complete living 
through voluntary co-operation is secured, may be simply 
stated. The fundamental requirement is that the life- 
sustaining actions of each shall severally bring him 
the amounts and kinds of advantage naturally achieved 
by them ; and this imphes firstly that he shall suffer no 
direct aggressions on his person or property, and secondly 
that he shall suffer no indirect aggressions by breach ot 
contract. Observance of these negative conditions to volun- 
tary co-operation having facilitated life to the greatest extent 
by exchange of services under agreement, life is to be further 
facilitated by exchange of services beyond agreement : the 
highest life being reached only when, besides helping to 
complete one another^s lives by specified reciprocities of aid, 
men otherwise help to complete one another's hves.

GHAPTBR IX. 

CBITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 

§ 56. Comparisons of the foregoing chapters with one 
another^ suggest sundry questions which must be answered 
partially, if not completely, before anything can be done 
towards reducing ethical principles from abstract forms to 
concrete forms. 

We have seen that to admit the desirableness of conscious 
existence, is to admit that conduct should be such as will 
produce a consciousness which is desirable — ^a consciousness 
which is as much pleasurable and as Uttle painful as may be. 
We have also seen that this necessary implication corre- 
sponds with the a 'priori inference, that the [evolution of life 
has been made possible only by the establishment of 
conueiiions between pleasures and beneficial actions and 
between pains and detrimental actions.^ But the general 
conclusion reached in both of these ways, though it covers 
the area within which our special conclusions must fall, 
does not help us to reach those special conclusions. 

Were pleasures all of one kind, difiering only in degree ; 
were pains all of one kind, differing only in degree ; and 
could pleasures be measured against pains with definite 
results; the problems of conduct would be greatly sim- 
plified. Were the pleasures and pains serving as incen- 
tives and deterrents, simultaneously present to consciousness 
with hke vividness, or were they all immediately impending, 
or were they all equi-distant in time; the problems would 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



CEITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 151 

be further simplified. And they would be still further 
simplified if the pleasures and pains were exclusively those 
of the actor. But both the desirable and the undesirable 
feelings are of various kinds, making quantitative com- 
parisons difficult; some are present and some are future; 
increasing the difficulty of quantitative comparison; some 
are entailed on self and some are entailed on others ; again 
increasing the difficulty. " So that the guidance yielded by 
the primary principle reached, is of little service unless 
supplemented by the guidance of secondary principles. J* 

Already, in recognizing the needful subordination of 
presentative feelings to representative feelings, and the 
implied postponement of present to future, throughout a 
wide range of cases, some approach towards a secondary 
principle of guidance has been made.;. Already, too, in 
recognizing the limitations which men's associated state 
puts to their actions, with the implied need for restraining 
feelings of some kinds by feelings of other kinds,.Ve have 
come in sight of another secondary principle of guidance. 
Still, there remains much to be decided respecting the 
relative claims of these guiding principles, general and 
special. 

Some elucidation of the questions involved, will be 
obtained by here discussing certain views and arguments 
set forth by past and present moralists. 

§ 57. Using the name hedonism for that ethical theory 
which makes happiness the end of action ; and distinguish- 
ing hedonism into the two kinds, egoistic and universalistic, 
according as the happiness sought is that of the actor 
himself or is that of all, Mr. Sidgwick alleges its implied 
belief to be that pleasures and pains are commensurable. 
In his criticism on (empirical) egoistic hedonism he says :— 

' *' The fiuidamental assumption of Hedonism, clearly stated, is that all 
feelings considered merely as feelings can be arranged in a certain scale of 
desirability, so that the desirability or pleasantness of each bears a definite 
ratio to that of all the others." — Methods ofEtUcs, 2nd ed. p. 115* 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



152 THE DATA OV BTHICS. 

And asserting this to be its assumption^ he proceeds to 
point out difficulties in the way of the hedonistic 
calculation; apparently for the purpose of implying that 
these difficulties tell against the hedonistic theory. 

Now though it may be shown that by naming the 
intensity, the duration, the certainty, and the proximity, of 
a pleasure or a pain, as traits entering into the estimation of 
its relative value, Bentham has committed himself to the 
specified assumption ; and though it is perhaps reasonably 
taken for granted that hedonism as represented by him, 
is identical with hedonism at large ; yet it seems to me that 
the hedonist, empirical or other, is not necessarily committed 
to this assumption. That the greatest surplus of pleasures 
over pains ought to be the end of action, is a belief which 
he may still consistently hold after admitting that the 
valuations of pleasures and pains are commonly vague 
and often erroneous. He may say that though indefinite 
things do not admit of definite measurements, yet approxi- 
mately true estimates of their relative values may be made 
when they differ considerably ; and he may further say that 
even when their relative values are not determinable, it 
remains true that the most valuable should be chosen. Let 
us listen to him. 

'' A debtor who cannot pay me, offers to compound for his 
debt by making over one of sundry things he possesses — 
a diamond ornament, a silver vase, a picture, a carriage. 
Other questions being set aside, I assert it to be my pecu- 
niary interest to choose the most valuable of these; but 
I cannot say which is the most valuable. Does the pro- 
position that it is my pecuniary interest to choose the most 
valuable therefore become doubtful ? Must I not choose as 
well as I can ; and if I choose wrongly must I give up my 
ground of choice ? Must I infer that in matters of business 
I may not act on the principle that, other things equal, the 
more profitable transaction is to be preferred ; because in 
many cases I cannot say which is the more profitable,

CRITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 153 

and have often cliosen the less profitable ? Because I 
believe that of many dangerous courses I ought to take the 
least dangerous^ do I make ' the fundamental assumption * 
that courses can be arranged according to a scale of 
dangerousness ; and must I abandon my belief if I cannot 
80 arrange them ? K I am not by consistency bound to do 
this, then I am no more by consistency bound to give up 
the principle that the greatest surplus of pleasures over 
pains should be the end of action^ because the ' commen- 
surability of pleasures and pains* cannot be asserted/' 

At the close of his chapters on empirical hedonism, 
Mr. Sidgwick himself says he does "not think that the 
common experience of mankind, impartially examined, really 
sustains the view that Egoistic Hedonism is necessarily 
suicidal j'^ adding, however, that the "uncertainty of hedon- 
istic calculation cannot be denied to have great weight.-' 
But here the fundamental assumption of hedonism, that 
happiness is the end of action, is still supposed to involve 
the assumption that ^'feelings can be arranged in a certain 
scale of desirability.*' This we have seen it does not : its 
fundamental assumption is in no degree invalidated by proof 
that such arrangement of them is impracticable. 

To Mr. Sidgwick's argument there is the further objection, 
no less serious, that to whatever degree it tells against 
egoistic hedonism, it tells in a greater degree against 
tmiversalistic hedonism, or utilitarianism. He admits that 
it tells as much ; saying ''whatever weight is to be attached 
to the objections brought against this assumption [the com- 
mensurability of pleasures and pains] must of course tell 
against the present method.'' Not only does it tell, but it 
tells in a double way. I do not mean merely that, as he 
points out, the assumption becomes greatly complicated if 
we take all sentient beings into account, and lE we include 
posterity along with existing individuals. I mean that, 
taking as the end to be achieved the greatest happiness of 
the existing individuals forming a single community, the set

of difficulties standing in the way of egoistic hedonism, is 
compounded with another set of difficulties no less great, 
when we pass from it to universalistic hedonism. For if the 
dictates of universalistic hedonism are to be ftdfilled, it 
must be under the guidance of individual judgments, or of 
corporate judgments, or of both. Now any one of such 
judgments issuing from a single mind, or from any aggregate 
of minds, necessarily embodies conclusions respecting the 
happinesses of other persons ; few of them known, and the 
great mass never seen. All these persons have natures 
differing ia countless ways and degrees from the natures of 
those who form the judgments; and the happinesses of 
which they are severally capable differ from one another, 
and differ from the happinesses of those who fonm the judg- 
ments. Consequently, if against the method of egoistic 
hedonism there is the objection that a man^s own pleasures 
and pains, unlike in their kinds, intensities, and times of 
occurrence, are incommensurable ; then against the method 
of universalistic hedonism it may be urged that to the in- 
commensurability of each judge's own pleasures, and pains 
(which he must use as standards) has now to be added the 
much more decided incommensurability of the pleasures and 
pains which he conceives to be experienced by innumerable 
other persons, all differently constituted from himself and 
from one another. 

Nay more — ^there is a triple set of difficulties in the way 
of universalistic hedonism. To the double indeterminateness 
of the end has to be added the indeterminateness of the 
means. If hedonism, egoistic or universalistic, is to pass 
from dead theory into living practice, acts of one or other 
kind must be decided on to achieve proposed objects ; and 
in estimating the two methods we have to consider how far 
the fitness of the acts respectively required can be judged* 
If, in pursuing his own ends, the individual is liable to 
be led by erroneous opinions to adjust his acts wrongly, 
much more liable is he to be led by erroneous opinions to

CBITICI8MS AND EXPLANATIONS. 155 

adjust wrongly more complex acts to the more complex ends 
constituted by other men's wel&res. It is so if he operates 
singly to benefit a few others ; and it is still more so if he 
co-operates with many to benefit all. Making general 
happiness the immediate object of pursuit, implies numerous 
and complicated instrumentalities officered by thousands of 
unseen and unlike persons, and working on millions of 
other persons unseen and unlike. Even the few factors in 
this immense aggregate of appliances and processes which 
are known, are very imperfectly known ; and the great mass 
of them are unknown. So that even supposing valuation 
of pleasures and pains for the community at large is more 
practicable than, or even as practicable as, valuation of his 
own pleasures and pains by the individual ; yet the ruling of 
conduct with a view to the one end is far more difficult than 
the ruling of it with a view to the other. Hence if the 
method of egoistic hedonism is unsatisfactory, far more un- 
satisfactory for the same and kindred reasons, is the method 
of universalistic hedonism, or utilitarianism. 

And here we come in sight of the conclusion which it 
has been the purpose of the foregoing criticism to bring 
into view. The objection made to the hedonistic method 
contains a tru^, but includes with it an untruth. For 
while the proposition that happiness, whether individual or 
general, is the end of action, is not invalidated by proof that 
it cannot under either form be estimated by measuremelit 
of its components ; yet it may be admitted that guidance 
in the pursuit of happiness by a mere balancing of pleasures 
and pains, is, if partially practicable throughout a certain 
range of conduct, futile throughout a much wider range. . It 
is quite consistent to assert that happiness is the ultimate 
aim of action, and at the same time to deny that it can 
be reached by making it the immediate aim, I gO with 
Mr. Sidgwick as far as the conclusion that ''we must at least 
admit the desirability of confirming or correcting the results 
of such comparisons [of pleasures and pains] by any other

156 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

method upon whicli we may find reason to rely;*' and I then 
go farther, and say that throughout a large part of conduct 
guidance by such comparisons is to be entirely set aside and 
replaced by other guidance. 

§ 58. The antithesis here insisted upon between the 
hedonistic end considered in the abstract, and the method 
which current hedonism, whether egoistic or universalistic, 
associates with that end ; and the joining acceptance of the 
one with rejection of the other; commits us to an overt 
discussion of these two cardinal elements of ethical theory. 
I may conveniently initiate this discussion by criticizing 
another of Mr. Sidgwick's criticisms on the method of 
hedonism. 

Though we &in give no account of those simple pleasures 

which the senses yield, because they are undecomposable, yet 

we distinctly know their characters as states of consciousness. 

Conversely, the complex pleasures formed by compounding 

and re-compounding the ideas of simple pleasures, though 

theoretically resolvable into their components, are not easy 

to resolve ; and in proportion as they are heterogeneous in 

composition, the difficulty of framing intelligible conceptions 

of them increases. This is especially the case with the 

pleasures which accompany our sports. Treating of these, 

along with the pleasures of pursuit in general, for the 

purpose of showing that '^ in order to get them one must 

forget them,^^ Mr. Sidgwick remarks : — 

" A man who maintains throughout an epicurean mood, fixing his aim on 
his own pleasure, does not catch the f uU spirit of the chase ; his eagerness 
never gets just the sharpness of edge which imparts to the pleasure its highest 
zest and flavour. Here comes into view what we may call the fundamental 
paradox of Hedonism, that the impulse towards pleasure, if too predominant, 
defeats its own aim. This effect is not visible, or at any rate is scarcely visible, 
in the case of passive sensual pleasures. But of our active enjoyments gene- 
rally, whether the activities on which they attend are classed as * bodily' or as 
* intellectual' (as well as of many emotional pleasures), it may certainly be said 
that we cannot attain them, at least in their best forp, so long as we concentrate 
our aim on them." — Methods 0/ MhdcSf 2nd ed. p. 41. 

Now I think we shall not regard this truth as paradoxical

CRITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 157 

after we have duly analyzed the pleasure of pursuit. The 
chief components of this pleasure are; — ^first, a renewed 
consciousness of personal efficiency (made vivid by actual 
success and partially excited by impending success) which 
consciousness of personal efficiency, connected in expe- 
rience with achieved ends of every kind, arouses a vague 
but massive consciousness of resulting gratifications ; and, 
second, a representation of the applause which recognition 
of this efficiency by others has before brought, and will 
again bring. Games of skill show us this clearly. Con- 
sidered as an end in itself, the good cannon which a billiard 
player makes yields no pleasure. Whence then does the 
pleasure of makiug it arise ? Partly from the fresh proof 
of capability which the player gives to himself, and partly 
from the imagined admiration of those who witness the 
proof of his capability : the last being the chief, since he 
soon tires of making cannons in the absence of witnesses. 
When from games which, yielding the pleasures of success, 
yield no pleasure derived from the end considered intrinsi- 
cally, we pass to sports in which the end has intrinsic 
value as a source of pleasure, we see substantially the same 
thing. Though the bird which the sportsman brings down 
is useful as food, yet his satisfaction arises mainly from 
having made a good shot, and from having added to the 
bag which will presently bring praise of his skill. The 
gratification of self-esteem he immediately experiences ; and 
the gratification of receiving applause he experiences, if not 
immediately and in full degree, yet by representation ; for 
the ideal pleasure is nothing else than a faint revival of the 
real pleasure. These two kinds of agreeable excitement 
present in the sportsman during the chase, constitute the 
mass of the^ desires stimulating him to continue it ; for all 
desires are nascent forms of the feelings to be obtained by 
the eflforts they prompt. And though while seeking more 
birds these representative feelings are not so vividly excited 
as by success just achieved, yet they are excited by

158 THB DATA 07 BTHJCS. 

iMiaginations of further successes ; and so make enjoyable 
the activities constituting the pursuit. Eecognizing, then, 
the truth that the pleasures of pursuit are much more those 
derived from the efficient use of means than those derived 
from the end itself, we see that ''the fundamental paradox ■ 
of hedonism^^ disappears. 

These remarks concerning end and means, and the pleasure 
accompanying use of the means as added to the pleasure 
derived from the end, I have made for the purpose of 
drawing attention to a fact of profound significance. During 
evolution there has been a superposing of new and more 
complex sets of means upon older and simpler sets of means ; 
and a superposing of the pleasures accompanying the 
uses of these successive sets of means ; with the result that 
each of these pleasures has itself eventually become an end. 
We begin with a simple animal which, without ancillary 
appliances, swallows such food as accident brings in its way ; 
and so, as we may assume, stills some kind of craving. 
Here we have the primary end of nutrition with its accom- 
panying satisfaction, in their simple forms. We pass to 
higher types having jaws for seizing and biting — jaws which 
thus, by their actions, facilitate achievement of the primary 
end. . On observiag animals furnished with these organs, 
we get evidence that the use of them becomes in itself 
pleasurable irrespective of the end: instance a squirrel, which, 
apart from food to be so obtained, delights in nibbling every- 
thing it gets hold of. Turning from jaws to limbs we see 
that these, serving some creatures for pursuit and others 
for escape, similarly yield gratification by their exercise ; as 
in lambs which skip and horses which prance. How the 
combined use of limbs and jaws, originally subserving the 
satisfaction of appetite, grows to be in itself pleasurable, is 
daily illustrated in the playing of dogs. For that throwing 
down and worrying which, when prey is caught, precedes 
eating, is, in their mimic fights, carried by each as far a?s he 
dares. Coming to means still more remote from the end.

CRITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 159 

namely, those by which creatures chased are canght, we 
are again shown by dogs that when no creature is caught 
there is still a gratification in the act of catching. The 
eagerness with which a dog runs after stones, or dances 
and barks in anticipation of jumping into the water after a 
stick, proves that apart from the satisfaction of appetite, and 
apart even from the satisfaction of killing prey, there is 
a satisfaction in the successful pursuit of a moving 
object. Throughout, then, we see that the pleasure attend- 
ant on the use of means to achieve an end, itself becomes 
an end. 

Now if we contemplate these as phenomena of conduct in 
general, some facts worthy of note may be discerned — fctcta 
which, if we appreciate their significance, will aid us in 
developing our ethical conceptions. One of them 

is that among the successive sets of means, the later 
are the more remote from the primary end; are, as co- 
ordinating earlier and simpler means, the more complex; 
and are accompanied by feelings which are more repre- 
sentative. Another fact is that each set of means, 
with its accompanying satisfactions, eventually becomes in 
its turn dependent on one origiDating later than itself. 
Before the gullet swallows, the jaws must lay hold ; before 
the jaws tear out and bring within the grasp of the gullet a 
piece fit for swallowing, there must be that co-operation of 
limbs and senses required for killing the prey ; before this 
co-operation can take place, there needs the much longer 
co-operation constituting the chase ; and even before this 
there must be persistent activities of Hmbs, eyes, and 
nose, in seeking prey. The pleasure attending each set 
of acts, while making possible the pleasure attending the set 
of acts which follows, is joined with a representation of this 
subsequent set of acts and its pleasure, and of the others 
which succeed in order; so that along with the feelings 
a<3Companying the search for prey, are partially aroused 
the feelings accompanying the actual chase, the actual de-

160 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

fitruction, the actnal devouring^ and the eyentnal satisfaction 
of appetite. A third fact is that the use of each set of 

means in due order^ constitutes an obligation. Mainte- 
nance of its life being regarded as the end of its conduct^ 
the creature is obliged to use in succession the means of 
finding prey, the means of catching prey, the means of 
killing prey, the means of devouring prey. Lastly, 

it follows that though the assuaging of hunger, directly 
associated with sustentation, remains to the last the 
ultimate end ; yet the successful use of each set of means 
in its turn is the proximate end — ^the end which takes 
temporary precedence in authoritativeness. 

§ 59. The relations between means and ends thus traced 
throughout the earlier stages of evolving conduct, are 
traceable throughout later stages ; and hold true of human 
conduct, up even to its highest forms. As fast as, for the 
better maintenance of life, the simpler sets of means and the 
pleasures accompanying the uses of them, come to be 
supplemented by the more complex sets of means and their 
pleasures, these begin to take precedence in time and in 
imperativeness. To use eflfectually each more complex set 
of means becomes the proximate end, and the accom- 
panying feeling becomes the immediate gratification sought; 
though there maybe, and habitually is, an associated conscious- 
ness of the remoter ends and remoter gratifications to 
be obtained. An example will make clear the parallelism. 

Absorbed in his business the trader, if asked what is his 
main end, will say — making money. He readily grants that 
achievement of this end is desired by him in furtherance of 
ends beyond it. He knows that in directly seeking money 
he is indirectly seeking food, clothes, house-room, and the 
' comforts of life for self and family. But while admitting that 
money is but a means to these ends, he nrgesthat the money- 
getting actions precede in order of time and obligation, the 
v^ous actions and concomitant pleasures subserved by 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



CEITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 161 

them; and he testifies to the fact that making money has 
become itself an end^ and success in it a source of satis- 
faction, apart from these more distant ends. Again, 
on observing more closely the trader^s proceedings, we find 
that though to the end of living comfortably he gets money, 
and though to the end of getting money he buys and sells 
at a profit, which so becomes a means more immediately 
pursued, yet he is chiefly occupied with means still more 
remote from ultimate ends, and in relation to which even the 
selling at a profit becomes an end. For leaving to subor- 
dinates the actual measuring out of goods and receiving of 
proceeds, he busies himself mainly with his general afiairs — 
inquiries concerning markets, judgments of future prices, 
calculations, negotiations, correspondence : the anxiety from 
hour to hour being to do well each ono of these things 
indirectly conducive to the making of profits. And these 
ends precede in time and obligation the effecting of profitable 
sales, just as the effecting of profitable sales precedes the 
end of money-making, and just as the end of money-making 
precedes the end of satisfactory living. His book- 
keeping best exemplifies the principle at large. Entries 
to the debtor or creditor sides are being made all through 
the day ; the items are classified and arranged in such way 
that at a mementos notice the state of each account may be 
ascertained ; and then, from time to time, the books are 
balanced, and it is required that the result shall come right 
to a pentiy : satisfaction following proved correctness, and 
annoyance being caused by error. If you ask why all this 
elaborate process, so remote from the actual getting of 
money, and still more remote from the enjoyments of life, 
the answer is that keeping accounts correctly is fulfilling a 
condition to the end of money-making, and becomes in 
itself a proximate end — ^a duty to be discharged, that there 
may be discharged the duty of getting an income, that 
there may be discharged the duty of maintaining self, wife, 
and children.

Approaching as we here do to moral obligation^ -are 
we not shown its relations to conduct at large ? Is it not 
clear that observance of moral principles is fulfilment of 
certain general conditions to the successful carrying on 
of special activities? That the trader may prosper, he 
must not only keep his books correctly, but must pay those 
he employs according to agreement, and must meet his 
engagements with creditors. May we not say, then, that 
conformity to the second and third of these requirements is, 
like conformity to the first, an indirect means to eflFectual 
use of the more direct means of achieving welfare ? May 
we not say, too, that as the use of each more indirect means 
in due order becomes itself an end, and a source of gratifica- 
tion ; so, eventually, becomes the use of this most indirect 
means ? And may we not infer that though conformity to 
moral requirements precedes in imperativeness conformity 
to other requirements ; yet that this imperativeness arises 
from the fact that fulfilment of the other requirements, by:' 
self or others or both, is thus furthered ? 

§ 60. This question brings us round to another side of the 
issue before raised. When alleging that empirical utili- 
tarianism is but introductory to rational utilitarianism, I 
pointed out that the last does not take welfare for its im- 
mediate object of pursuit, but takes for its immediate object 
of pursuit conformity to certain principles which, in the nature 
of things, causally determine welfare. And now we see that 
this amounts to recognition of that law, traceable throughout 
the evolution of conduct in general, that each later and 
higher order of means takes precedence in time and authori- 
tativeness of each earlier and lower order of means. The 
contrast between the ethical methods thus distinguished, 
made tolerably clear by the above illustrations, will be made 
still clearer by contemplating the two as put in opposition 
by the leading exponent of empirical utilitarianism. Treat- 
ing of legislative aims, Bentham writes :—

CBITICISM6 AND EXPLANATIONS. 163 

'' Bat jnstioe, what is it that we are to understand by jnstice : and whj not 
happiness but justice f What happiness is, every man knows, because, what 
pleasure is, every man knows, and what pain is, every man knows. But what 
justice is, — ^this is what on every occasion is the subject-matter of dispute. Be 
the meaning of the word justice what it will, what regard is it entitled to 
otherwise than as a means of happiness."* 

Let ns first consider tlie assertion here made respecting 
the relative intelligibilities of these two ends; and let 
us afterwards consider what is implied by the choice of 
happiness instead of justice. 

Bentham^s positive assertion that '^what happiness is 
every man knows, because, what pleasure is, every man 
knows,** is met by counter-assertions equally positive. 
" Who can tell,** asks Plato, '' what pleasure really is, or 
know it in its essence, except the philosopher, who alone 
is conversant with realities.**t Aristotle, too, after com- 
menting on the different opinions held by the vulgar, by 
the pohtical, by the contemplative, says of happiness that 
" to some it seems to be virtue, to others prudence, and 
to others a kind of wisdom : to some again, these, or some 
one of these, with pleasure, or at least, not without pleasure; 
others again include external prosperity.** J And Aristotle, 
like Plato, comes to the remarkable conclusion that the 
pleasures of the intellect, reached by the contemplative 
life, constitute the highest happiness ! § - How 

disagreements concerning the nature of happiness and 
the relative values of pleasures, thus exhibited in ancient 
times, continue down to modern times, is shown in 
Mr. Sidgwick*s discussion of egoistic hedonism, above 
commented upon. Further, as was pointed out before, the 
indefiniteness attending the estimations of pleasures and 
pains, which stands in the way of egoistic hedonism as 
ordinarily conceived, is immensely increased on passing to 
nniversalistic hedonism as ordinarily conceived; since its

164 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

theory implies that the imagined pleasures and pains of 
others are to be estimated by the help of these pleasures 
and pains of self^ already so difficult to estimate. And that 
anyone after observing the various pursuits into which some 
eagerly enter but which others shun^ and after listening 
to the different opinions concerning the likeableness of this 
or that occupation or amusement^ expressed at every table^ 
should assert that the nature of happiness can be fully 
agreed upon, so as to render it a fit end for direct legislative 
action, is surprising. 

The accompanying proposition that justice is unin- 
telligible as an end, is no less surprising. Though primitive 
men have no words for either happiness or justice; yet 
even among them an approach to the conception of justice 
is traceable. The law of retaliation, requiring that a 
death inflicted by one tribe on another, shall be balanced 
by the death either of the murderer or some member of 
his tribe, shows us in a vague shape that notioh of equal- 
ness of treatment which forms an essential element in 
it. When we come to early races who have 

given their thoughts and feelings literary form, we find 
this conception of justice, as involving equalness of action, 
becoming distinct. Among the Jews, David expressed in 
words this association of ideas when, praying to God to "hear 
the right,^^ he said — "Let my sentence come forth from thy 
presence ; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal ;" 
as also, among early Christians, did Paul when to the Oolos- 
sians he wrote — " Masters, give unto your servants that which 
is just and equal.'' Commenting on the different meanings 
of justice, Aristotle concludes that "the just will therefore 
be the lawful and the equal; and the unjust the unlawful 
and the unequal. But since the unjust man is also one who 
takes more than his share,'' &c. And that justice was simi- 
larly conceived by the Romans they proved by including 
under it such meanings as exact, proportionate, impartial, 
severally implying fairness of division; and still better

CRITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 165 

by identification of it with equity, which is a derivative 
of cequiis : the word cequus itself having for one of its 
meanings just or impartial. This coincidence of 

view among ancient peoples respecting the nature of 
justice, has extended to modem peoples ; who by a general 
agreement in certain cardinal principles which their systems 
of law embody, forbidding direct aggressions, which are 
forms of unequal actions, and forbidding indirect aggressions 
by breaches of contract, which are other forms of unequal 
actions, one and all show us the identification of justice 
with equalness. Bentham, then, is wrong when he says — 
*^But what justice is, — this is what on every occasion 
is the subject-matter of dispute.^^ He is more wrong, 
indeed, than has thus far appeared. For, in the first 
place, he misrepresents utterly by ignoring the fcict that 
in ninety-nine out of every hundred daily transactions 
between men, no dispute about justice arises; but the 
business done is recognized on both sides as justly done. 
And in the second place if, with respect to the hundredth 
transaction there is a dispute, the subject matter of it is not 
''what justice is,'' for it is admitted to be equity or 
equalness ; but the subject matter of dispute always is — 
what, under these particular circumstances, constitutes 
equalness ? — a widely different question. 

It is not then self-evident, as Bentham alleges, that 
happiness is an intelligible end while justice is not; but, 
contrariwise, examination makes evident the greater in- 
telligibility of justice as an end. And analysis shows why 
it is the more intelligible. For justice, or equity, or equal- 
ness, is concerned exclusively with quwntity under stated 
conditions; whereas happiness is concerned with both 
quantity and quality under conditions not stated. When, as 
in case of theft, a benefit is taken while no equivalent 
benefit is yielded — ^when, as in case of adulterated goods 
bought or base coin paid, that which is agreed to be 
given in exchange as of equal value is not given, but some-

166 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

thing of less value — ^when, as in case of broken contract, the 
obligation on one side has been discharged while there has 
been no discharge, or incomplete discharge, of the obligation 
on the other ; we see that, the drcurnstances being specified, 
the injustice complained of refers to the relative amounts 
of actions, or products, or benefits, the natures of which 
are recognized only so far as is needful for saying 
whether as much has been given, or done, or allowed, by 
each concerned, as was implied by tacit or overt understand- 
ing to be an eqmvahnt. But when the end proposed is 
happiness, the circumstances remaining unspecified, the 
problem is that of estimating both quantities and qualities, 
unhelped by any such definite measures as acts of exchange 
imply, or as contracts imply, or as are implied by the 
differences between the doings of one aggressing and 
one aggressed upon. The mere fact that Bentham himself 
includes as elements in the estimation of each pleasure 
or pain, its intensity, duration, certainty, and proximity, 
suffices to show how difficult is this problem. And when 
it is remembered that all pleasures and pains, not felt in 
particular cases only but in the aggregate of cases, and 
severally regarded under these four aspects, have to be 
compared with one another and their relative values deter- 
mined, simply by introspection ; it will be manifest both 
that the problem is complicated by the addition of indefinite 
judgments of qualities to indefinite measures of quantities, 
and that it is further complicated by the multitudinous- 
ness of these vague estimations to be gone through and 
summed up. %/^ 

But now passing over this assertion of Bentham that 
happiness is a more intelligible end than justice, which we 
find to be the reverse of truth, let us note the several 
implications of the doctrine that the supreme legislative 
body ought to make the greatest happiness of the greatest 
number its immediate aim. 

It implies, in the first place, that happiness may be

CBITIOISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 167 

compassed by methods framed directly for the pm-pose, 
without any previous inquiry respecting the conditions that 
must be fulfilled ; and this pre-supposes a belief that there 
are no such conditions. For if there are any conditions 
without fulfilment of which happiness cannot be compassed^ 
then the first step must be to ascertain these conditions 
with a view to fulfilling them ; and to admit this is to admit 
that not happiness itself must be the immediate end^ but 
fulfilment of the conditions to its attainment must be the 
immediate end. The alternatives are simple : — Either the 
achievement of happiness is not conditional, in which case 
one mode of action is as good as another, or it is conditional, 
in which case the required mode of action must be the direct 
aim and not the happiness to be achieved by it. 

Assuming it conceded, as it will be, that there exist 
conditions which must be fulfilled before happiness can be 
attained, let us next ask what is implied by proposing 
modes of so controlling conduct as to further happiness, 
without previously inquiring whether any such modes are 
already known ? The implication is that human intelligence 
throughout the past, operating on experiences, has failed 
to discover any such modes ; whereas present human 
intelligence may be expected forthwith to discover them. 
Unless this be asserted, it must be admitted that certain con- 
ditions to the achievement of happiness have already been 
partially, if not wholly, ascertained; and if so, our first 
business should be to look for them. Having found them, 
our rational course is to bring existing intelligence to 
bear on these products of past intelligence, with the 
expectation that it will verify the substance of them while 
possibly correcting the form. But to suppose that no 
regulative principles for the conduct of associated human 
beings have thus far been established, and that they are now 
to be established de novo, is to suppose that man as he is 
differs from man as he was in an incredible degree. 

Beyond ignoring the probability, or rather the certainty,

that past experience generalized by past intelligence, must 
by this time have disclosed partially, if not wholly, some of 
the essential conditions to the achievement of happiness, 
Bentham^s proposition ignores the formulated knowledge 
of them actually existing. For whence come the conception 
of justice and the answering sentiment. He will scarcely 
say that they are meaningless, although his proposition 
implies as much ; and if he admits that they have mean- 
ings, he must choose between two alterDatives either of 
which is fatal to his hypothesis. Are they supernaturally- 
caused modes of thinking and feeling, tending to make men 
fulfil the conditions to happiness ? If so their authority is 
peremptory. Are they modes of thinking and feeling 
naturally caused in men by experience of these condi- 
tions ? If so, their authority is no less peremptory. Not 
only, then, does Bentham fail to infer that certain prin- 
ciples of guidance must by this time have been ascertained, 
but he refuses to recognize these principles as actually 
reached and present to him. 

And then after aU, he tacitly admits that which he overtly 
denies, by saying that — " Be the meaning of the word 
justice what it will, what regard is it entitled to otherwise 
than as a means to happiness V' For if justice is a means 
having happiness as its end, then justice must take prece- 
dence of happiness, as every other means takes precedence 
of every other end. Bentham's own elaborate polity is a 
means having happiness as its end, as justice is, by his 
own admission, a means having happiness as an end. If, 
then, we may properly skip justice, and go directly to 
the end happiness, we may properly skip Bentham's polity, 
and go directly to the end happiness. In short, we are 
led to the remarkable conclusion that in all cases we 
must contemplate exclusively the end and must disregard 
the means. 

§ 61 This relation of ends to means, underlying all ethical

speculation, will be further elucidated if we join with 
some of the above conclusions, certain conclusions drawn 
in the last chapter. We shall see that while greatest hap- 
piness may vary widely in societies which, though ideally 
constituted, are subject to unlike physical circumstances, 
certain fundamental conditions to the achievement of this 
greatest happiness, are common to all such societies. 

Given a people inhabiting a tract which makes nomadic 
habits necessary, and the happiness of each individual will 
be greatest when his nature is so moulded to the require- 
ments of his life, that all his faculties find their due activities 
in daily driving and tending cattle, milking, migrating, and 
so forth. The members of a community otherwise similar, 
which is permanently settled, will severally achieve their 
greatest happiness when their natures have become such that 
a fixed habitat, and the occupations necessitated by it, supply 
the spheres in which each instinct and emotion is exercised 
and brings th^ concomitant pleasure. The citizens of a large 
nation industrially organized, have reached their possible 
ideal of happiaess, when the producing, distributing, and 
other activities, are such in their kinds and amounts, that each 
citizen finds in them a place for all his energies and aptitudes, 
while he obtains the means of satisfying all his desires. 
Once more we may recognize as not only possible but pro- 
bable, the eventual existence of a community, also industrial 
the members of which, having natures similarly responding 
to these requirements, are also characterized by dominant 
aesthetic faculties, and achieve complete happiness only 
when a large part of life is filled with aesthetic activities. 
Evidently these difierent types of men, with their different 
standards of happiness, each finding the possibility of that' 
happiness in his own society, would not find it if transferred 
to any of the other societies. Evidently though they might 
have in common such kinds of happiness as accompany 
the satisfaction of vital needs, they would not have in common 
sundry other kinds of happiness.

170 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

But now mark that while^ to achieve greatest happiness 
in each of such societies, the special conditions to be f alfiUed 
must differ from those to be fulfilled in the other societies, 
certain general conditions must be fulfilled in all the societies. 
Harmonious co-operation, by which alone in any of them 
the greatest happiness can be attained^ is^ as we saw, 
made possible only by respect for one another's claims: 
there must be neither those direct aggressions which we 
class as crimes against person and property, nor must there 
be those indirect aggressions constituted by breaches of con- 
tracts. So that maintenance of equitable relations between 
men, is the condition to attainment of greatest happiness 
in all societies; however much the greatest happiness 
attainable in each may differ in nature, or amount, or both. 

And here a physical analogy may fitly be used to give the 
greatest definiteness to this cardinal truth. A mass of 
matter of whatever kind, maintains its state of internal 
equilibrium, so long>as its component particles severally stand 
towards their neighbours in equi-distant positions. Accept- 
ing the conclusions of modem physicists, which imply 
that ^kch molecule moves rhythmically, then a balanced 
state implies that each performs its movements within a 
space bounded by the like spaces required for the move- 
ments of those around. If the molecules have been so 
aggregated that the oscillations of some are more restrained 
than the oscillations of others, there is a proportionate insta- 
bility. If the number of them thus unduly restrained is 
considerable, the instability is such that the cohesion in some 
part is liable to fail, and a crack results. If the excesses of 
restraint are great and multitudinous, a trifling disturbance 
causes the mass to break up into small fragments. To 
which add that the recognized remedy for this unstable state, 
is an exposure to such physical condition (ordinarily high 
temperature) as enables the molecules so to change theii" 
relative positions that their mutual restraints become 
equal on all sides. And now observe that this holds what*

CEITICISMS AND EXPLANATIONS. 171 

ever be the natures of the molecules. They may be simple ; 
they may be compound ; they may be composed of this or 
that matter in this or that way. In other words, the special 
activities of each molecule, constituted by the relative move- 
ments of its units, may be various in their kinds and degrees ; 
and yet, b6 they what they may, it remains true that to 
preserve internal equilibrium throughout the mass of mole- 
cules, the mutual limitations of their activities must be 
everywhere alike. 

And this is the above-described pre-requisite to social 
equilibrium, whatever the special natures of the associated 
persons. Assuming that within each society such persons are 
of the same type, needing for the fulfilment of their several 
lives kindred activities, and though these activities may be 
of one kind in one society and of another kind in another, so 
admitting of indefinite variation, this condition to social 
equiUbrium does not admit of variation. It must be fulfilled 
before complete life, that is greatest happiness, can be 
attained in any society ; be the particular quality of that life, 
or that happiness, what it may.* 

§ 62. After thus observing how means and ends in conduct 
stand to one another, and how there emerge certain con- 
clusions respecting their relative claims, we may see a way 
to reconcile sundry conflicting ethical theories. These 
severally embody portions of the truth ; and simply require 
combining in proper order to embody the whole truth. 

The theological theory contains a part. If for the divine 
will, supposed to be supematurally revealed, we substitute 
the naturally-revealed end towards which the Power mani- 
fested throughout Evolution works ; then, since Evolution 
has been, and is still, working towards the highest life, it 
follows that conforming to those principles by which the 
highest life is achieved, is furthering that end. The doctrine 

* This oniyersal requirement it was which I had in yiew when Choosing for 
my first work, published in 1850, the title Social Statics.

172 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

that perfection or excellence of nature ahoold be the object 
of pursuit^ is in one sense trae; for it tacitly recognizes 
that ideal form of being which the highest life impUes^ and 
to which Eirolation tends. There is a tmth^ also^ in the doc- 
trine that virtoe must be the aim; for this is another form 
of the doctrine that the aim mnst be to fulfil the conditions 
to achievement of the highest life. That the intuitions of a 
moral faculty should guide our conduct^ is a proposition in 
which a truth is contained ; for these intuitions are the slowly 
organized results of experiences received by the race while 

(living in presence of these conditions. And that happiness is 
the supreme end is beyond question true ; for this is the 
1 concomitant of that highest life which every theory of 
' moral guidance has distinctly or vaguely in view. 

So understanding their relative positions^ those ethical 
systems which make virtue^ nght^ obligation^ the cardinal 
aims^ are seen to be complementary to those ethical systems 
which make welfare^ pleasure, happiness^ the cardinal aims. 
Though the moral sentiments generated in civilized men by 
daily contact with social conditions and gradual adaptation 
to them^ are indispensable as incentives and deterrents; 
and though the intuitions corresponding to these senti- 
ments^ have, in virtue of their origin^ a general authority to 
be reverently recognized ; yet the sympathies and antipathies 
hence originating, together with the intellectual expressions 
of them, are, in their primitive forms, necessarily vague. 
To make guidance by them adequate to all requirements, 
their dictates have to be interpreted and made definite by 
science; to which end there must be analysis of those 
conditions to complete living which they respond to, and 
from converse with which they have arisen. And such 
analysis necessitates the recognition of happiness for each 
and all, as the end to be achieved by fulfilment of these 
conditions. 

Hence, reoognisdng in due degrees all the various ethical 
theories, conduct in its highest form will take as guides.

innate perceptions of right duly enlightened and made 
precise by analytic intelligence ; while conscious that 
these guides are proximately supreme solely because they 
lead to the ultimately supreme end^ happiness special and

CHAPTER X. 

THE BELATIVITY OF PAINS AND PLEASURES. 

§ 63. A truth of cardinal importance as a datum of 
HJthics, which was incidentally referred to in the last 
chapter, must here be set forth at full length. I mean 
the truth that not only men of diflTerent races, but aJso 
diflferent men of the same race, and even the same men 
at different periods of life, have different standards of 
happiness. Though there is some recognition of this by 
moralists, the recognition is inadequate; and the far- 
reaching conclusions to be drawn when the relativity of 
happiness is fully recognized, are scarcely suspected. 

It is a belief universal in early life — a belief which in 
most people 'is but partially corrected in later life, and in 
very few wholly dissipated — ^that there is something 
intrinsic in the pleasantness of certain things, while 
other things are intrinsically unpleasant. The error is 
analogous to, and closely allied with, the error crude realism 
makes. Just as to the uncultured mind it appears self- 
evident that the sweetness of sugar is inherent in sugar, 
that sound as we perceive it is sound as it exists in the 
external world, and that the warmth from a fire is in 
itself what it seems; so does it appear self-evident that 
the sweetness of sugar is necessarily grateful, that there 
is in a beautiful sound something that must be beautiful 
to all creatures, and that the agreeable feeling produced

THE RELATIVITY OF PAINS AND PLBASUfiES. 175 

by warmth is a feeling which every other consciousness 
must find agreeable. 

But as criticism proves the one set of conclusions to 
be wrong, so does it prove to be wrong the other set. 
Not only are the qualities of external things as intel- 
lectually apprehended by us, relative to our own organisms ; 
but the pleasurableness or painf ulness of the feelings which 
we associate with such qualities, are also relative to our own 
organisms. They are so in a double sense—they are rela- 
tive to its structures, and they are relative to the states of 
its structures. 

That we may not rest in a mere nominal acceptance of 
these general truths, but may so appreciate them as to 
see their full bearings on ethical theory, we must here 
glance at them as exemplified by animate creatures at 
large. For after contemplating the wide divergences of 
sentiency accompanying the wide divergences of organiza- 
tion which evolution in general has brought about, we shall 
be enabled the better to see the divergences of sentiency to 
be expected from the further evolution of humanity. 

§ 64. Because they can be most quickly disposed of, let us 
first deal with pains : a further reason for first deaUng with 
pains being that we may thus forthwith recogni«e, and then 
leave out of consideration, those sentient states the qualities 
of which may be regarded as absolute rather than relative. 

The painf ulness of the feelings produced by forces which 
tend to destroy organic structures, wholly or in part, is of 
course common to all creatures capable of feeling. We saw 
it to be inevitable that during evolution there must every- 
where be established such connexions between external 
actions and the modes of consciousness they cause, that the 
injurious ones are accompanied by disagreeable feelings 
and the beneficial ones by agreeable feelings. Consequently, 
pressures or strains which tear or bruise, and heats which 
burn or scald, being in all cases partially or wholly destruc-

176 THE DATA OF BTHICS, 

tive, are in all cases painfal. But even here the 

relativity of the feelings may in one sense be asserted. For 
the effect of a force of given quantity or intensity, varies 
partly with the size and partly with the structure of the 
creature exposed to it. The weight which is scarcely felt 
by a large animal crushes a small one; the blow which 
breaks the Umb of a mouse produces Httle effect on a horse; 
the weapon which lacerates a horse leaves a rhinoceros 
uninjured. And with these differences of injuriousness doubt- 
less go differences of feeling. Merely glancing at the 
illustrations of this truth furnished by sentient beings in 
general, let us consider the illustrations mankind furnish. 

Comparisons of robust labouring men with women or 
children, show us that degrees of mechanical stress which 
the first bear with impunity, produce on the others 
injuries and accompanying pains. The blistering of a 
tender skin by an amount of friction which does not even 
redden a coarse one, or the bursting of superficial blood- 
vessels, and consequent discolouration, caused in a person of 
lax tissues by a blow which leaves in well-toned tissues no 
trace, will sufficiently exemplify this contrast. Not 

only, however, are the paius due to violent incident forces, 
relative to the characters or constitutional quaUties of the 
parts directly affected, but they are relative in equally marked 
ways, or even in more marked ways, to the characters of 
the nervous structures. The common assumption is that equal 
bodily injuries excite equal pains. But this is a mistake. 
Pulling out a tooth or cutting off a limb, gives to different 
persons widely different amounts of suffering: not the 
endurance only, but the feeling to be endured, varies greatly; 
and the variation largely depends on the degree of nervous 
development. This is well shown by the great insensi- 
bility of idiots : blows, cuts, and extremes of heat and cold, 
being borne by them with indifference.* The relation thus 
shown in the most marked manner where the development

THE RELATIVITY OP PAINS AND PLEASUBES. 177 

of the central nervous system is abnormally low> is shown 
in a less marked manner where the development of the 
central nervous system is normally low; namely, among 
inferior races of men. Many travellers have commented 
on the strange callousness shown by savages who have 
been mangled in battle or by accident; and surgeons in 
India say that wounds and operations are better borne by 
natives than by Europeans. Further, there comes the 
converse fact that among the higher types of men, larger- 
brained and more sensitive to pain than the lower, the most 
sensitive are those whose nervous developments, as shown 
by their mental powers, are the highest: part of the evidence 
being the relative intolerance of disagreeable sensations 
common among men of genius,* and the general irritability 
characteristic of them. 

That pain is relative not to structures only, but to their 
states as well, is also manifest— more mcmifest indeed. 
The sensibility of an external part depends on its tem- 
perature. Cool it below a certain point and it becomes, as 
we say, numb ; and if by ether-spray it is made very cold, 
it may be cut without any feeling being produced. Con- 
versely, heat the part so that its blood-vessels dilate, and 
the pain which any injury or irritation causes is greater than 
usual. How largely the production of pain depends on the 
condition of the part affected, we see in the extreme 
tenderness of an inflamed surface — a tenderness such that 
a slight touch causes shrinking, and such that rays from 
the fire which ordinarily would be indifferent become 
intolerable. Similarly with the special senses. A 

light which eyes that are in good order bear without dis- 
agreeable feeling, cannot be borne by inflamed eyes. And 
beyond the local state, the state of the system as a whole, 
and the state of the nervous centres, are both factors. 
Those enfeebled by illness are distressed by noises which, 
those in health bear with equanimity ; and men with over-

178 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

wrongbt brains are irritated in nnusoal degrees by annoyances^ 
both physical and moral. Further, the temporary 

condition known as exhaustion enters into the relation. 
Limbs over- worn by prolonged exertion, cannot without 
aching perform acts which would at other times cause no 
appreciable feeling. After reading continuously for very 
many hours, even strong eyes begin to smart. And noises 
that can be listened to for a short time with indifference^ 
become, if there is no cessation, causes of suffering. 

So that though there is absoluteness in the relation 
between positive pains and actions that are positively in- 
jurious, in so far that wherever there is sentiency it exists ; 
yet even here partial relativity may be asserted. For there 
is no fixed relation between the acting force and the pro- 
duced feeling. The amount of feeling varies with the size 
of the organism, with the character of its outer structures, 
with the character of its nervous system ; and also with the 
temporary states of the part affected, of the body at large, 
and of the nervous centres. 

§ 65. The relativity of pleasures is far more conspicuous ; 
and the illustrations of it furnished by the sentient world at 
large are innumerable. 

It needs but to glance round at the various things which 
different creatures are prompted by their desires to eat and 
are gratified in eating — ^flesh for predaceous animals, grass 
for the herbivora, worms for the mole, flies for the swallow, 
seeds for the finch, honey for the bee, a decaying car- 
<»se for the maggot — to be reminded that the tastes for 
foods are relative to the structures of the creatures. And 
this truth, made conspicuous by a survey of animeds in 
general, is forced on our attention even by a survey of 
different races of men. Here human flesh is abhorred, and 
there regarded as the greatest delicacy; in this country 
roots are allowed to putrefy before they are eaten, and in 
that the taint of decay produces disgust; the whale's

blubber whicli one race devours with avidity, will in another 
by its very odour produce nausea. Nay, without looking 
abroad we may, in the common saying that '^one man^s 
meat is another man's poison,'' see the general admission 
that members of the same society so far differ, that a taste 
which is to these pleasurable is to those displeasurable. So 
is it with the other senses. Assafoetida which by us is 
singled out as typical of the disgusting in odour, ranks 
among the Esthonians as a favourite perfume; and even 
those aronnd us vary so far in their likings that the scents 
of flowers grateful to some are repugnant to others. 
Analogous differences in the preferences for colours, we 
daily hear expressed. And in a greater or less degree the 
like holds with all sensations, down even to those of touch : 
the feeling yielded by velvet, which is to most agreeable, 
setting the teeth on edge in some. 

It needs but to name appetite and satiety to suggest 
multitudinous facts showing that pleasures are relative not 
only to the organic structures but also to their states. The 
food which yields keen gratification when there is great 
hunger ceases to be grateful when hunger is satisfied; and 
if then forced on the eater is rejected with aversion. So, 
too, a particular kind of food, seeming when first tasted so 
delicious that daily repetition would be a source of endless 
enjoyment, becomes, in a few days, not only unenjoyable but 
repugnant. Brilliant colours which, falling on unaccustomed 
eyes give delight, pall on the sense if long looked at ; and 
there is relief in getting away from the impressions they 
yield. Sounds sweet in themselves and sweet in their com- 
binations, which yield to unfatigued ears intense pleasure, 
become, at the end of a long concert, not only wearisome 
but, if there is no escape from them, causes of irritation. 
The like holds down even to such simple sensations as those 
of heat and cold. The fire so delightful on a winter's day 
is, in hot weather, oppressive ; and pleasure is then taken in 
the cold water from which, in winter, there would be

180 THE DATA 07 ETHICS. 

shrinking. Indeed, experiences lasting over but a few 
moments suffice to show how relative to the states of the 
structures are pleasurable sensations of these kinds ; for it 
is observable that on dipping the cold hand into hot water, 
the agreeable feeling gradually diminishes as the hand 
warms. 

These few instances will carry home the truth, manifest 
enough to all who observe, that the receipt of each agreeable 
sensation depends primarily on the existence of a structure 
which is called into play; and, secondarily, on the condition 
of that structure, as fitting it or unfitting it for activity, 

§ 66. The truth that emotional pleasures are made possible, 
partly by the existence of correlative structures and partly 
by the states of those structures, is equally undeniable. 

Observe the animal which, leading a Hfe demanding soli- 
tary habits, has an adapted organization, and it gives no 
sign of need for the presence of its kind. Observe, con- 
versely, a gregarious animal separated from the herd, and 
you see marks of unhappiness while the separation continues, 
and equally distinct marks of joy on joining its com- 
panions. In the one case there is no nervous structure 
which finds its sphere of action in the gregarious state; 
and in the other case such a structure exists. As was 
implied by instances cited in the last chapter for another 
purpose, animals leading lives involving particular kinds 
of activities, have become so constituted that pnrsuanc3 
of those activities, exercising the correlative structures, 
yields the associated pleasures. Beasts of prey confined 
in dens, show us by their pacings from side to side the 
endeavour to obtain, as well as they can, the satisfactions 
that accompany roaming about in their natural habitats; 
and that gratification in the expenditure of their loco- 
motive energies shown us by porpoises playing round a 
vessel, is shown us by the similarly-unceasing excursions 
from end to end of its cell which a captured porpoise

makes. The perpetual hoppings of the canary from bar to 
bar of its cage^ and the ceaseless use of claws and bill in 
climbing about its perch by the parrot, are other activities 
which, severally related to the needs of the species, have 
severally themselves become sources of agreeable feelings. 
Still more clearly are we shown by the efforts which a 
caged beaver makes to build with such sticks and pieces 
of wood as are at hand, how dominant in its nature 
has become the building instinct ; and how, apart from any 
advantage gained, its gets gratification by repeating, as well 
as it can, the processes of construction it is organized to 
carry on. The cat which, lacking something to tear with 
her claws, pulls at the mat with them, the confined giraffe 
which, in default of branches to lay hold of wears out 
the upper angles of the doors to its house by continually 
grasping them with its prehensile tongue, the rhinoceros 
which, having no enemy to fight, ploughs up the ground 
with his horn, all yield us analogous evidence. Clearly, 
these various actions performed by these various creatures 
are not intrinsically pleasurable; for they differ more or 
less in each species and are often utterly unlike. The 
pleasurableness is simply in the exercise of nervo-muscular 
structures adapted to the performance of the actions. 

Though races of men are contrasted with one another so 
much less than genera and orders of animals are, yet, as we 
saw in the last chapter, along with visible differences there 
go invisible differences, with accompanying likings for 
different modes of life. Among some, as the Mantras, the 
love of unrestrained action and the disregard of companion- 
ship, are such that they separate if they quarrel, and hence 
live scattered; while among others, as the Damaras, there 
is little tendency to resist, but instead, an admiration for 
any one who assumes power over them. Already when 
exemphfying the indefiniteness of happiness as an end of 
action, I have referred to the unlike ideals of life pursued 
by the nomadic and the settled, the warlike and the peaceful, 

\

182 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

— unlike ideals which imply unlikenesses of nervous 
structures caused by the inherited effects of unlike habits 
accumulating through generations. These contrasts^ various 
in their kinds and degrees among the various types of 
mankind, everyone can supplement by analogous contrasts 
observable among those around. The occupations some 
delight in are to those otherwise constituted intolerable; 
and men's hobbies, severally appearing to themselves quite 
natural, often appear to their friends ludicrous and almost 
insane : facts which alone might make us see that the 
pleasurableness of actions of this or that kind, is due not to 
anything in the natures of the actions but to the existence 
of faculties which find exercise in them. 

It must be added that each pleasurable emotion, like each 
pleasurable sensation, is relative not only to a certain 
structure but also to the state of that structure. The parts 
called into action must have had proper rest — ^must be in a 
condition fit for action; not in the condition which prolonged 
action produces. Be the order of emotion what it may, an 
unbroken continuity in the receipt of it eventually brings 
satiety. The pleasurable consciousness becomes less and 
less vivid, and there arises the need for a temporary cessation 
during which the parts that have been active may recover 
their fitness for activity ; and during which also, the activities 
of other parts and receipt of the accompanying emotions 
may find due place. 

§ 67. I have insisted on these general truths with 
perhaps needless iteration, to prepare the reader for more 
fully recognizing a corollary that is practically ignored. 
Abundant and clear as is the evidence, and forced though it 
is daily on everyone's attention, the conclusions respecting 
life and conduct which should be drawn, are not drawn; 
and so much at variance are these conclusions with current 
beliefs, that eni^nciation of them causes a stare of incre- 
dulity. Pervaded as all past thinking has been, and as 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE BELATIVITT OF FAINS AND PLEASURES. 183 

most present thinking is^ by the assumption that the nature 
of every creature has been specially created for it, and that 
human nature, also specially created, is, like other natures, 
fixed — ^pervaded too as this thinking has been, and is, by 
the allied assumption that the agreeableness of certain 
actions depends on their essential qualities, while other 
actions are by their essential qualities made disagreeable ; 
it is difficult to obtain a hearing for the doctrine that the 
kinds of action which are now pleasurable will, under 
conditions requiring the change, cease to be pleasurable, 
while other kinds of action will become pleasurable. Even 
those who accept the doctrine of Evolution mostly hear 
with scepticism, or at best with nominal faith, the in- 
ferences to be drawn from it respecting the humanity of 
the future. 

And yet as shown in myriads of instances indicated 
by the few above given, those natural processes which 
have produced multitudinous forms of structure adapted to 
multitudinous forms of activity, have simultaneously made 
these forms of activity pleasurable. And the inevitable 
implication is that within the limits imposed by physical 
laws, there will be evolved, in adaptation to any new 
sets of conditions that may be established, appropriate 
structures of which the functions will yield their respective 
gratifications. 

When we have got rid of the tendency to think that 
certain modes of activity are necessarily pleasurable because 
they give us pleasure, and that other modes which do not 
please us are necessarily unpleasing ; we shall see that the xy 
re-moulding of human nature into fitness for the require- 
ments of social life, must eventually make all needful 
activities pleasurable, while it makes displeasurable all 
activities at variance with these requirements. When we 
have come f uUy to recognize the truth that there is nothing 
intrinsically more gratifying in the efforts by which wild 
animals are caught, than in the efforts expended in rearing

plants^ and that the combined actions of muscles and 
senses in rowing a boat are not by their essential natures 
more productive of agreeable feeling than those gone 
through in reaping corn, but that everything depends on 
the co-operating emotions, which at present are more in 
accordance with the one than with the other; we shall infer 
that along with decrease of those emotions for which the 
social state affords little or no scope, and increase of those 
which it persistently exercises, the things now done with 
dislike from a sense of obligation will be done with imme- 
diate liking, and the things desisted from as a matter of 
duty will be desisted from because they are repugnant. 

This conclusion, alien to popular beliefs and in ethical 
speculation habitually ignored, or at most recognized but 
partially and occasionally, will be thought by the majority 
so improbable that I must give further justification of it : 
enforcing the a priori argument by an a posteriori one. 
Small as is the attention given to the fact, yet is the fact 
conspicuous that the corollary above drawn from the doctrine 
of Evolution at large, coincides with the corollary which 
past and present changes in human nature force on us. The 
leading contrasts of character between savage and civilized, 
are just those contrasts to be expected from the process of 
adaptation. 

The life of the primitive man is passed mainly in the 
pursuit of beasts, birds, and fish, which yields him a 
gratifying excitement; but though to the civilized man the 
chase gives gratification, this is neither so persistent nor so 
general. There are among us keen sportsmen; but there 
are many to whom shooting and fishing, soon become weari- 
some; and there are not a few to whom they are altogether 
indifferent or even distasteful. Conversely, the power 

of continued application which in the primitive man is very 
small, has among ourselves become considerable. It is 
true that most are coerced into industry by niecessity ; 
but there are sprinkled throughout society men to whom

THE RELATIVITY OF PAINS AND PLEASURES . 185 

active occupation is a need — men who are restless when 
away from business and miserable when they eventually 
give it up ; men to whom this or that line of investigation 
is so attractive, that they devote themselves to it day after 
day, year after year ; men who are so deeply interested in 
public affairs that they pass lives of labour in achieving 
political ends they think advantageous, hardly giving them- 
selves the rest necessary for health. Yet again, and 
still more strikingly, does the change become manifest when 
we compare undeveloped with developed humanity in respect 
of the conduct prompted by fellow feeling. Cruelty rather 
than kindness is characteristic of the savage, and is in many 
cases a source of marked gratification to him ; but though 
among the civilized are some in whom this trait of the 
savage survives, yet a love of inflicting pain is not general, 
and besides numbers who show benevolence, there are those 
who devote their whole time and much of their money to 
philanthropic ends, without thought of reward either here 
or hereafter. Clearly these major, along with many 
minor, changes of nature, conform to the law set forth. 
Activities appropriate to their needs which give pleasures t6 
savages have ceased to be pleasurable to many of the 
civilized; while the civilized have acquired capacities for 
other appropriate activities a^d accompanying pleasures 
which savages had no capacities for. 

Now, not only is it rational to infer that changes like those 
which have been going on during civilization, will continue 
to go on, but it is irrational to do otherwise. Not he who 
believes that adaptation will increase is absurd, but he who 
doubts that it will increase is absurd. Lack of faith in such 
further evolution of humanity as shall harmonize its nature 
with its conditions, adds but another to the countless illus- 
trations of inadequate consciousness of causation. One who, 
leaving behind both primitive dogmas and primitive ways 
oif looking at things, has, while accepting scientific conclu- 
sions, acquired those habits of thought which science

generates^ will regard the conclusion above drawn as 
inevitable. He will find it impossible to believe that the 
processes which have heretofore so moulded all beings to 
the requirements of their lives that they get satisfactions in 
fulfilling them^ will not hereafter continue so moulding 
them. He will infer that the type of nature to which the 
highest social life affords a sphere such that every faculty 
has its due amount^ and no more than the due amount^ 
of function and accompanying gratification, is the type 
of nature towards which progress cannot cease till it 
is reached. Pleasure beiug producible by the exercise of 
any structure which is adjusted to its special end, he will 
see the necessary implication to be that, supposing it con- 
sistent with maintenance of life, there is no kind of activity 
which will not become a source of pleasure if continued ; 
and that therefore pleasure wiU eventually accompany every 
mode of action demanded by social conditions. 

This corollary I here emphasize because it will presently 
play an important part in the argument.

CHAPTER XI. 

EGOISM VERSUS ALTRUISM. 

§ 68. If insistence on them tends to unsettle established 
systems of belief, self-evident truths are by most people 
silently passed oyer ; or else there is a tacit refusal to draw 
from them the most obvious inferences. 

Of self-evident truths so dealt with, the one which 
here concerns us is that a creature must live before it can 
act^ From this it is a corollary that the acts by whidi each 
maintains his own' life must, speaking generally, precede 
in imperativeness all other acts of which he is capable. For 
if it be asserted that these other acts must precede in 
imperativeness the acts which maintain life; and if this, 
accepted as a general law of conduct, is conformed to 
by all; then JqL_pgs^oning^ the acts which _maintai n life 
toJihe other acts-jgh ich^life makes possible,, all must lose 
^th^irJives. That is to say. Ethics has to recognize the truth, 
recognized in unethical thought, that egoism comes before 
altruism. The acts required for continued selE-preservation, 
including the enjoyment of benefits achieved by such acts, 
are the first requisites to universal welfare. Unless each 
duly cares for himself, his care for all others is ended by 
death ; and if each thus dies, there remain no others to 
be cared for. 

This permanent supremacy of egoism over altruism, made

manifest by contemplating existing life^ is farther made 
manifest by contemplating life in conrse of evolution. 

§ 69. Those who have followed with assent the recent 
coarse of thought^ do not need telling that throughout past 
eras, the life, vast in amount and varied in kind, which has 
overspread the Earth, has progressed in subordination to 
the law that every individual shall gain by whatever aptitude 
it has for fulfilling the conditions to its existence. The 
uniform principle has been that better adaptation shall bring 
greater benefit ; which greater benefit, while increasing the 
prosperity of the better adapted, shall increase also its ability 
to leave ofispring inheriting more or less its better adapta- 
tion. And, by implication, the uniform principle has been 
that the ill-adapted, disadvantaged in the struggle for 
existence, shall bear the consequent evils : either dis- 
appearing when its imperfections are extreme, or else 
rearing fewer offspring, which, inheriting its imperfections, 
tend to dwindle away in posterity. 

It has been thus with innate superiorities ; it has been 
thus also with acquired ones. All along the law has been that 
increased function brings increased power ; and that there- 
ifore such extra activities as aid welfare in any member of 
a race, produce in its structures greater ability to carry on 
such extra activities : the derived advantages being enjoyed 
by it to the heightening and lengthening of its life. Con- 
versely, as lessened function ends in lessened structure, the 
dwindling of unused faculties has ever entailed loss of 
power to achieve the correlative ends : the result of inade- 
quate fulfilment of the ends being diminished ability to 
. ^/» ' maintain life. And by__inheritance, such functionally-pro- 1 
-^ ' duced modifications have respectively furthered or hindered 

survival in posterity. 

As already said, the law that each creature shall take the 
benefits and the evils of its own nature, be they those 
derived from ancestry or those due to self-produced 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



EGOISM VABSUS ALTBUISSI. 189 

modifications, has been the law under which life has evolved 
thus far ; and it must continue to be the law however much 
further life may evolve. Whatever qualifications this 
natural course of action may now or hereafter undergo, are 
qualifications that cannot, without fatal results, essentially 
change it. Any arrangements which in a considerable / 
degree prevent superiority from profiting by the rewards ' 
of superiority, or shield inferiority from the evils ' 
it entails — any arrangements which tend to make it as . 
well to be inferior as to be superior; are arrangements > 
diametrically opposed to the progress of organization and I 
the reaching of a higher life. 

But to say that each individual shall reap the benefits / 
brought to him by his own powers, inherited and acquired, / 
is to enunciate egoism as an ultimate principle of conduct. I 
It is to say that egoistic claims must take precedence of ( 
altruistic claims. 

§ 70. Under its biological aspect this proposition cannot 
be contested by those who agree in the doctrine of Evolution; 
but probably they will not at once allow that admission of 
it under its ethical aspect is equally unavoidable. While, as 
respects development of life, the well-working of the 
universal principle described is sufficiently manifest; the 
well-working of it as respects increase of happiness may 
not be seen at once. But the two cannot be disjoined. 

Incapacity of every kind and of whatever degree, causes 
unhappiness directly and indirectly — directly by the pain 
consequent on the over-taxing of inadequate faculty, and 
indirectly by the non-fulfilment, or imperfect fulfilment, 
of certain conditions to welfare. Conversely, capacity of 
every kind sufficient for the requirement, conduces to 
happiness immediately and remotely — immediately by the 
pleasure accompany mg tbe normal exercise of each power 
that is up to its work, and remotely by the pleasures which 
are furthered by the ends achieved. A creature that is

weak or slow of f oot^ and so gets food only by exhausting 
efforts or escapes enemies with difficalty^ suffers the pains of 
over-strained powers^ of unsatisfied appetites^ of distressed 
emotions ; while the strong and swift creature of the same 
species delights in its efficient activities^ gains more fully 
the satisfactions yielded by food as well as the renewed 
vivacity this gives, and has to bear fewer and smaller pains 
in defending itself against foes or escaping from them. 
Similarly with duller and keener senses, or higher and 
lower degrees of sagacity. The mentaUy-inf erior individual 
of any race suffers negative and positive miseries; while the 
mentally-superior individual receives negative and positive 
gratifications. Inevitably, then, this law in conformity with 
which each member of a species takes the consequences of 
its own nature ; and in virtue of which the progeny of each 
member, participating in its nature, also takes such con- 
sequences; is one that tends ever to raise the aggregate 
happiness of the species, by furthering the multiplication 



' the happier and hindering that of the less happy, 

All this is true of human beings as of other beings. Tl^ 

I conclusion forced on us is that the pursuit of individual 

—1 ( happiness within those limits prescribed by social conditions, 

( is the first requisite to the attainment of the greatest general 

happiness. To see this it needs but to contrast one wbose 

self-regard has maintained bodily well-being, with one 

wbose regardlessness of self has brought its natural results; 

and then to ask what must be the contrast between two 

societies formed of two such kinds of individuals. 

^ Bounding out of bed after an unbroken sleep, singing or 

whistling as he dresses, coming down with beaming face 

ready to laugh on the smallest provocation, the healthy man 

of high powers, conscious of past successes and by his 

energy, quickness, resource, made confident of the future, 

enters on the day's business not with repugnance but with 

gladness; and from hour to hour experiencing satis&c* 

tions from work effectually done, comes home with an

abundant surplus of energy remaining for hours of relaxa- 
tion. Par otherwise is it with one who is enfeebled by 
great neglect of self. Already deficient, his energies 
are made more deficient by constant endeavours to execute 
tasks that prove beyond his strength, and by the resulting 
discouragement. Besides the depressing consciousness 
of the immediate future, there is the depressing con- 
sciousness of the remoter future, with its probability of 
accumulated difficulties and diminished ability to meet 
them. Hours of leisure which, rightly passed, bring 
pleasures that raise the tide of life and renew the 
powers of work, cannot be utilized : there is not vigour 
enough for enjoyments involving action, and lack of spirits 
prevents passive enjoyments from being entered upon with 
zest. In brief, life becomes a burden. Now if, as must 
be admitted, in a community composed of individuals Uke 
the first the happiness will be relatively great, while in 
one composed of individuals like the last there will be 
relatively Uttle happiness, or rather much misery ; it must 
be admitted that conduct causing the one result is good 
and conduct causing the other is bad. 

But diminutions of general happiness are produced by 
inadequate egoism in several other ways. These we will 
successively glance at. 

§ 71. If there were no proofs of heredity— if it were 
the rule that the strong are usually begotten by the weak 
while the weak usually descend from the strong, that viva- 
cious children form the families of melancholy parents while 
fathers and mothers with overflowing spirits mostly have 
dull progeny, that from stoHd peasants there ordinarily 
come sons of high intelligence while the sons of the 
cultured are commonly fit for nothing but following the 
plough — ^if there were no transmission of gout, scrofula, 
insanity, and did the diseased habitually give birth to the 
healthy and the healthy to the diseased, writers on Ethics

might be justified in ignoring those effects of conduct which 
are felt by posterity through the natures they inherit. 

As it is, however, the current ideas concerning the 
relative claims of egoism and altruism are vitiated by the 
omission of this all-important factor. For if health, strength 
and capacity, are usually transmitted ; and if disease, 
feebleness, stupidity, generally reappear in descendants; 
then a rational altruism requires insistance on that egoism 
which is shown by receipt of the satisfactions accompanying 
preservation of body and mind in the best state. The 
necessary implication is that blessings are provided for 
offspring by due self-regard, while disregard of self carried 
too far provides curses. When, indeed, we remember how 
commonly it is remarked that high health and overflowing 
spirits render any lot in life tolerable, while chronic 
ailments make gloomy a life most favourably circum- 
stanced, it becomes amazing that both the world at large 
and writers who make conduct their study, should 
ignore the terrible evils which disregard of personal well- 
being inflicts on the unborn, and the incalculable good 
laid up for the unborn by attention to personal well- 
beiug. Of all bequests of parents to children the most 
valuable is a sound constitution. Though a man's body is 
not a property that can be inherited, yet his constitution 
may fitly be compared to an entailed estate ; and if he rightly 
understands his duty to posterity, he will see that he is 
bound to pass on that estate uninjured if not improved. 
To say this is to say that he must be egoistic to the 
extent of satisfying all those desires associated with the 
due performance of functions. Nay, it is to say more. It 
is to say that he must seek in due amounts the various 
pleasures which life offers. For beyond the effect these 
have in raising the tide of life and maintaining constitu- 
tional vigour, there is the effect they have in preserving and 
increasing a capacity for receiving enjoyment. Endowed 
with abundant energies and various tastes, some can get 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



EGOISM VERSUS ALTEUISM. 193 

gratifications of many kinds on opportunities hourly occur- 
ring; while others are so inert, and so uninterested in things 
around, that they cannot even take the trouble to amuse them- 
selves. And unless heredity be denied, the inference must be 
that due acceptance of the miscellaneous pleasures life ofiers,. 
conduces to the capacity for enjoyment in posterity ; and . 
that persistence in dull monotonous lives by parents, 
diminishes the ability of their descendants to make the 
best of what gratifications fall to them. / 

§ 72. Beyond the decrease of general happiness whichr 
results in this indirect way if egoism is unduly subordinated,] 
there is a decrease of general happiness which results in a 
direct way. He who carries self-regard far enough to keep/ 
himself in good health and high spirits, in the first placej 
thereby becomes an immediate source of happiness to 
those around, and in the second place maintains the/ 
ability to increase their happiness by altruistic actions. 
But one whose bodily vigour and mental health are under- 
mined by self-sacrifice carried too far, in the first place/ 
becomes to those around a cause of depression, and in the) 
second place renders .himself incapable, or less capable, of 
actively furthering their welfare. 

In estimating conduct we must remember that there 
are those who by their joyousness beget joy in others, 
and that there are those who by their melancholy cast a 
gloom on every circle they enter. And we must remember 
that by display of overflowing happiness a man of the one 
kind may add to the happiness of others more than by 
positive efforts to benefit them ; and that a man of the other 
kind may decrease their happiness more by his presence 
than he increases it by his actions. Pull of vivacity, the one 
is ever welcome. For his wife he has smiles and jocose 
speeches ; for his children stores of fun and play ; for his 
fiHiends pleasant talk interspersed with the sallies of wit that 
come from buoyancy. Contrariwise, the other is shunned.

194 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

The irritability resulting now from ailments^ now from 
failures caused by feebleness^ his family has daily to bear. 
Lacking adequate energy for joining in them^ he has at 
best but a tepid interest in the amusements of his children; 
and he is called a wet blanket by his friends. Little 
account as our ethical reasonings take note of it, yet is the 
fact obvious that since happiness and misery are infectious^ 
such regard for self as conduces to health and high spirits 
is a benefaction to others^ and such disregard of self as 
brings on suffering, bodily or mental, is a malefaction to 
others. The duty of making one's self agreeable by 

seeming to be pleased, is, indeed, often urged ; and thus 
to gratify friends is applauded so long as self-sacrificing 
effort is implied. But though display of real happiness 
gratifies friends far more than display of sham happiness, 
and has no drawback in the shape either of hypocrisy or 
strain, yet it is not thought a duty to f alfil the conditions 
which favour the display of real happiness. Nevertheless, if 
quantity of happiness produced is to be the measure, the 
last is more imperative than the first. 

And then, as above indicated, beyond this primary series 
of effects produced on others there is a secondary series of 
effects. The adequately egoistic individual retaius those 
powers which make altruistic activities possible. TEheJfldt 
vidual wh ^ ^'g JBfl<^^an« tely egoistic , loses more or less of his 
ability to be altruistic. The truth of the one proposition is 
self-evident ; and the truth of the other is daily forced on us 
by examples. Note a few of them. Here is a mother 

who, brought up in the insane fashion usual among the 
cultivated, has a physique not strong enough for suckling her 
infant, but who, knowing that its natural food is the best, 
and anxious for its welfare, continues to give it milk for a 
longer time than her system will bear. Eventually the accu- 
mulating reaction tells. There comes exhaustion running, 
it may be, into illness caused by depletion ; occasionally end- 
ing in death, and often entailing chronic weakness. She

EGOISM YEBSnS ALTBUISM. 195 

becomes^ perhaps for a time^ perhaps permanently^ incapable 
of carrying on household affairs ; her other children suffer 
from the loss of maternal attention ; and where the income 
is small, payments for nurse and doctor tell injuriously on 
the whole family. Instance, again, what not unire- 

quently happens with the father. Similarly prompted by 
a high sense of obligation, and misled by current moral 
theories into the notion that self-denial may rightly be 
carried to any extent, he daily continues his office-work for 
long hours regardless of hot head and cold feet ; and debars 
himself from social pleasures, for which he thinks he can 
afford neither time nor money. What comes of this entirely 
unegoistic course ? Eventually a sudden collapse, sleepless- 
ness, inability to work. That rest which he would not give 
himself when his sensations prompted, he has now to take 
in long measure. The extra earnings laid by for the benefit 
of his family, are quickly swept away by costly journeys in 
aid of recovery, and by the many expenses which illness 
entails. Instead of increased ability to do his duty by 
his offspring, there comes now inability. Life-long evils 
on them replace hoped-for goods. And so is it, too, 

with the social effects of inadequate egoism. All grades 
furnish examples of the mischiefs, positive and negative, 
inflicted on society by excessive neglect of self. Now the' 
case is that of a labourer who, conscientiously continuing 
his work under a broiling sun, spite of violent protest from 
his feelings, dies of sunstroke ; and leaves his family a burden 
to the parish. Now the case is that of a clerk whose eyes 
permanently fail from over-straining, or who, daily writing 
for hours after his fingers are painfully cramped, is attacked 
with '' scrivener's palsy," and, unable to write at all, sinks 
with aged parents into poverty which friends are called on 
to mitigate. And now the case is that of a man devoted 
to public ends who, shattering his health by ceaseless appli- 
cation, fails to achieve all he might have achieved by a more

196 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

reasonable apportionment of his time between labour on 
behalf of others and ministration to his own needs. 

§ 73. In one further way is the nndne subordination of 
egoism to altruism injurious. Both directly and indirectly 
, unselfishness pushed to excess generates selfishness. 

Consider first the immediate effects. That one man may 
yield up to another a gratification^ it is needful that the 
other shall accept it ; and where the gratification is of a 
kind to which their respectiye claims are equals or which is 
no more required by the one than by the other, acceptance 
implies a readiness to get gratification at another's cost. 
The circumstances and needs of the two being alike, the 
transaction involves as much culture of egoism in the 
last as it involves culture of altruism in the first. It is true 
that not unfirequently, difference between their means or 
difference between their appetites for a pleasure which the 
one has had often and the other rarely, divests the accept- 
ance of this character ; and it is true that in other cases 
the benefactor manifestly takes so much pleasure in giving 
pleasure, that the sacrifice is partial, and the reception of it 
not wholly selfish. But to see the effect above indicated we 
must exclude such inequalities, and consider what happens 
where wants are approximately alike and where the sacri- 
fices, not reciprocated at intervals, are perpetually on one 
side. So restricting the inquiry all can name instances 
verifying the alleged result. Everyone can remember 
circles in which the daily surrender of benefits by the gene- 
rous to the greedy, has caused increase of greediness; until 
there has been produced an unscrupulous egoism intolerable 
to all around. There are obvious social effects of kindred 

i nature. Most thinking people now recognize the demorali- 
zation caused by indiscriminate charity. They see how in 
the mendicant there is, besides destruction of the normal 
relation between labour expended and benefit obtained,

SaOISU YEBSXTS ALTBOISU. 197 

a genesis of the expectation that others shall minister 
to hiK needs; showing itself sometimes in the venting 
of curses on those who refose. 

Next consider the remote results. When the egoistio 
claims are do much subordinated to the altruistic as to 
produce physical mischief^ the tendency is towards a relative 

(decrease in the number of the altruistic^ and therefore an 
increased predominance of the egoistic. Pushed to extremes^ 
sacrifice of self for the benefit of others^ leads occasionally 
to death before the ordinary period of marriage; leads 
sometimes to abstention from marriage^ as in sisters of 
charity ; leads sometimes to an ill-health or a loss of attrac- 
tiveness which prevents marriage ; leads sometimes to non- 
acquirement of the pecuniary means needed for marriage; 
and in all these cases, therefore^ the unusually altruistic leave 
no descendants. Where the postponement of personal 
welfare to the welfare of others has not been carried so far 
as to prevent marriage, it yet not unfrequently occars that 
the physical degradation resulting from years of self -neglect 
causes infertility; so that again the most altroistically- 
\ natured leave no like-natured posterity. And then in less 
marked and more numerous cases, the resulting enfeeble- 
ment shows itself by the production of relatively weak off- 
spring; of whom, some die early, while the rest are less 
likely than usual to transmit the parental type to fature 
generations. Inevitably, then, by this dying out of the 
especially unegoistic, there is prevented that desirable mitiga- 
tion of egoism in the average nature which would else have 
taken place. Such disregard of self as brings down bodily I 
vigour below the normal level, eventually produces in the I 
society a counterbalancing excess of regard for self. ' 

§ 74. That egoism precedes altruism in order of impera- 
tiveness, is thus clearly shown. The acts which make 
continued life possible, must, on the average, be more 
peremptory than all those other acts which life makes

possible; inclading the acts which benefit others. To^ng^ 
from Hfe as existing to life as evolving, we are equally j^bown 
this. Sentient beings have progressed from low to high 
types, under the law that the superior shall projSt by their 
superiority and the inferior shall sufier from their inferiority. 
Conformity to this law has been, and is still, needful, not 
only for the continuance of life but for the increase of happi- 
ness ; since the superior are those having faculties better 
adjusted to the requirements — ^faculties, therefore, which 
bring in their exercise greater pleasure and less pain. 

More special considerations join these more general 
ones in showing us this truth. Such egoism as preserves a 
vivacious mind in a vigorous body furthers the happiness 
of descendants, whose inherited constitutions make the 
labours of life easy and its pleasures keen ; while, conversely, 
unhappiness is entailed on posterity by those who bequeath 
them constitutions injured by self-neglect. Again, the 
individual whose well-conserved life shows itself in over- 
flowing spirits, becomes, by his mere existence, a source of 
pleasure to all around ; while the depression which com- 
monly accompanies ill-health diffuses itself through family 
and among friends. A further contrast is that whereas one 
who has been duly regardful of self retains the power of 
being helpful to others, there results from self-abnegation 
in excess, not only an inability to help others but the inflic- 
tion of positive burdens on them. Lastly, we come upon 
the truth that undue altruism increases egoism ; both directly 
in contemporaries and indirectly in posterity. 

And now observe that though the general conclusion 
enforced by these special conclusions, is at variance with 
nominally-accepted beliefs, it is not at variance with actually- 
accepted beliefs. While opposed to the doctrine which men 
are taught should be acted upon, it is in harmony with the 
doctrine which they do act upon and dimly see must be 
acted upon. For omitting such abnormalities of conduct as 
are instanced above, everyone, alike by deed and word.

impKes that in the business of life personal welfare is the 
primary consideration. The labourer looking for wages in 
return for work done, no less than the merchant who sells 
goods at a profit, the doctor who expects fees for advice, 
the priest who calls the scene of his ministrations '' a living,'' 
assumes as beyond question the truth that selfishness, 
carried to the extent of enforcing his claims and enjoying 
the returns his efibrts bring, is not only legitimate but 
essential. Even persons who avow a contrary conviction prove 
by their acts that it is inoperative. Those who repeat with 
emphasis the maxim — '^ Love your neighbour as yourself,'' 
do not render up what they possess so as to satisfy the 
desires of all as much as they satisfy their own desires. 
Nor do those whose extreme maxim is — ^^ Live for others," 
differ appreciably from people around in their regards 
for personal welfare, or fail to appropriate their shares 
of life's pleasures. In short, that which is above set forth 
as the beHef to which scientific ethics leads us, is that 
which men do really believe, as distinguished from that which 
they believe they believe. 

Finally it may be remarked that a rational egoism, so far 
from implying a more egoistic human nature, is consistent 
with a human nature that is less egoistic. For excesses in 
one direction do not prevent excesses in the opposite direc- 
tion ; but rather, extreme deviations from the mean on one 
side lead to extreme deviations on the other side. A society 
in which the most exalted principles of self-sacrifice for the 
benefit of neighbours are enunciated, may be a society 
in which unscrupulous sacrifice of alien fellow- creatures is 
not only tolerated but applauded. Along with professed 
anxiety to spread these exalted principles among heathens, 
there may go the dehberate fastening of a quarrel upon 
them with a view to annexing their territory. Men 
who every Sunday have listened approvingly to injunctions 
carrying the regard for other men to an impracticable 
extent, may yet hire themselves out to slay, at the word

of command, any people in any part of the world, utterly 
indifEerent to the right or wrong of the matter fought about. 
And as in these cases transcendent altruism in theory co- 
exists with brutal egoism in practice, so, conversely, a 
more qualified altruism may have for its concomitant a 
greatly moderated egoism. For asserting the due claims of 
self, is, by implication, drawing a limit beyond which the 
claims are undue ; and is, by consequence, bringing into 
greater clearness the claims of others.

§ 75. If we define altruism as being all action wliicli, 
in the normal course of things^ benefits others instead of 
benefiting seH, then^ from the dawn of life^ altruism 
has been no less essential than egoism. Though primarily i 
it is dependent on egoism^ yet secondarily egoism is | 
dependent on it. 

, Under altruism in this comprehensive sense^ I take in the 
acts by which offspring are preserved and the species 
maintained. Moreover, among these acts must be included 
not such only as are accompanied by consciousness^ but also 
such as conduce to the welfare of offspring without mental 
representation of the welfare — acts of automatic altruism 
as we may call them. Nor must there be left out 
those lowest altruistic acts which subserve race-mainten- 
ance without implying even automatic nervous processes 
—acts not in the remotest sense psychical^ but in a 
literal sense physical. Whatever action, unconscious or 
conscious, involves expenditure of individual life to the 
end of increasing life in other individuals, is unquestionably 
altruistic in a sense, if not in the usual sense ; and it is here 
needful to understand it in this sense that we may see how 
conscious altruism grows out of unconscious altruismi

fission. Physical altruism of the lowest kind, differentiating 
from physical egoism, may in this case be considered as not 
yet independent of it. For since the two halves which 
before fission constituted the individual, do not on dividing 
disappear, we must say that though the individuality of the 
parent infusorium or other protozoon is lost in ceasing 
to be single, yet the old individual continues to exist in 
each of the new individuals. When, however, as happens 
generally with these smallest animals, an interval of quies- 
cence ends in the breaking up of the whole body into minute 
parts, each of which is the germ of a young one, we see the 
parent entirely sacrificed in forming progeny. 

Here might be described how among creatures of higher 
grades, by fission or gemmation, parents bequeath parts of 
' their bodies, more or less organized, to form offspring at 
, the cost of their own individualities. Numerous examples 
might also be given of the ways in which the development 
of ova is carried to the extent of making the parental body 
little more than a receptacle for them : the implication being 
that the accumulations of nutriment which parental activities 
have laid up, are disposed of for the benefit of posterity. 
And then might be dwelt on the multibudinous cases where, 
as generally throughout the insect-world, maturity having 
been reached and a new generation provided for, life ends : 
death follows the sacrifices made for progeny. 

But leaving these lower types in which the altruism is 
physical only, or in Vvhich it is physical and automatically- 
psychical only, let us ascend to those in which it is also, to 
a considerable degree, conscious. Though in birds and 
mammals such parental activities as are guided by instinct, 
are accompanied by either no representations or but vague 
representations of the benefits which the young receive ; 
yet there are also in them actions which we may consider 
altruistic in the higher sense. The agitation which creatures 
of these classes show when their young are in danger, joined 
often with efforts on their behalf, as well as the grief dis-

ALTEUISM VERSUS EGOISM. 203 

played after loss of their young, make it manifest that in 
them parental altruism has a concomitant of emotion. 

Those who understand by altruism only the conscious 
sacrifice of self to others among human beings, will think it 
strange, or even absurd, to extend its meaning so widely. 
But the justification for doing this is greater than has thus 
far appeared. I do not mean merely that in the course of 
evolution, there has been a progress through infinitesimal 
gradations from purely physical and unconscious sacrifices of 
the individual for the welfare of the species, up to sacrifices 
consciously made. I mean that from* first to last the sacri- 
fices are, when reduced to their lowest terms, of the same/ 
essential nature : to the last, as at first, there is involved a/ 
loss of bodily substance. When a part of the parental v 
body is detached in the shape of gemmule, or egg, or foetus, 
the material sacrifice is conspicuous ; and ivhen the mother 
yields milk by absorbing which the young one grows, it 
cannot be questioned that there is also a material sacrifice. 
But thouffh a material sacrifice is not manifest when the 
young are benefited by activities on their behalf 5 yet, as 
no effort can be made without an equivalent waste of tissue, 
and as the bodily loss is proportionate to the expenditure 
that takes place without reimbursement in food consumed, 
it follows that efforts made in fostering offspring do 
really represent a part of the parental substance ; which is 
now given indirectly instead of directly. 

Self-sacrifice, then, is no less primordial than self-preser- 
vation. Being in its simple physical form absolutely neces- 
sary for the continuance of life from the beginning ; and 
being extended under its automatic form, as indispensable 
to maintenance of race in types considerably advanced ; and 
being developed to its semi-conscious and conscious forms, 
along with the continued and complicated attendance by 
which the offspring of superior creatures are brought to 
maturity; altruism has been evolving simultaneously with ( 
egoism. As was pointed out in an early chapter, the )

same superiorities whicli have enabled the individual to 
preserve itself better, have enabled it better to preserve the 
individuals derived from it ; and each higher species, using 
its improved faculties primarily for egoistic benefit, has 
spread in proportion as it has used them secondarily for 
altruistic benefit. 

The imperativeness of altruism as thus understood, is, 
indeed, no less than the imperativeness of egoism was shown 
to be in the last chapter. For while, on the one hand, a 
falling short of normal egoistic acts entails enfeeblement 
or loss of life, and therefore loss of ability to perform altru- 
istic acts ; on the other hand, such defect of altruistic acts 
as causes death of oflfspring or inadequate development of 
ihem, involves disappearance from future generations of the 
nature that is not altruistic enough — so decreasing the 

(average egoism. In short, every species is continually 
purifying itself from the unduly egoistic individuals, while 
there are being lost to it the unduly altruistic individuals. 

§ 76. As there has been an advance by degrees from 
unconscious parental altruism to conscious parental altruism 
of the highest kind, so has there been an advance by 
degrees from the altruism of the family to social altruism. 

A fact toMbe^st noted is that only where altruistic rela- 
tions in the domestic group have reached highly-developed 
forms, do there arise conditions making possible full deve- 
lopment of altruistic relations in the political group. 
Tribes in which promiscuity prevails or in which the 
marital relations are transitory, and tribes in which poly- 
andry entails in another way indefinite relationships, are 
incapable of much organization. Nor do peoples who are 
habitually polygamous, show themselves able to take on 
those high forms of social co-operation which demand due 
r subordination of self to others. Only where monogamies 
\ marriage has become general and eventually universal — 
^ only where there have consequently been established the I

pclosest ties of blood — only where family altruism has been 
\ most fostered, has social altruism become conspicuous. It 
needs but to recall the compound forms of the Aryan family 
as described by Sir Henry Maine and others, to see that 
family feeling, first extending itself to the gens and the 
tribe, and afterwards to the society formed of related tribes, 
prepared the way for fellow feeling among citizens not 
of the same stock. 

Eecognizing this natural transition, we are here chiefly 
concerned to observe that throughout the latter stages of 
the progress, as throughout the former, increase of egoistic 
satisfactions has depended on growth of regard for the 
satisfactions of others. On contemplating a line of succes- 
sive parents and offspiing, we see that each, enabled while 
young to live by the sacrifices predecessors make for it, itself 
makes, when adult, equivalent sacrifices for successors; and 
that in default of this general balancing of benefits received 
by benefits given, the line dies out. Similarly, it is manifest 
that in a society each generation of members, indebted for 
such benefits as social organization yields them to pre- 
ceding generations, who have by their sacrifices elaborated 
this organization, are called on to make for succeeding 
generations such kindred sacrifices as shall at least main- 
tain this organization, if they do not improve it : the alter- 
native being decay and eventual dissolution of the society, 
implying gradual decrease in the egoistic satisfactions of its 
members. 

And now we are prepared to consider the several ways in 
which, under social conditions, personal welfare depends on 
due regard for the welfare of others. Already the conclu- 
sions to be drawn have been foreshadowed. As in the 
chapter on the biological view were implied the inferences 
definitely set forth in the last chapter ; so in the chapter on 
the sociological view were implied the inferences to be 
definitely set forth here. Sundry of these are trite enough;

bnt thej must nevertheless be specified^ since the statement 
would be incomplete without thenu 

§ 77. First to be dealt with comes that negative altruism 
implied by such curbing of the egoistic impulses as prevents 
direct aggression. 

As before shown, if men instead of living separately are 
to unite for defence or for other purposes, they must seve- 
rally reap more good than evil from the union. On the 
average, each must lose less from the antagonisms of those 
with whom he is associated, than he gains by the association. 
At the outset, therefore, that increase of egoistic satisfactions 
which the social state brings, can be purchased only by 
altruism sufficient to cause some recognition of others' 
claims : if not a voluntary recognition, still, a compulsory 
recognition. 

"WTiile the recognition is but of that lowest kind due ta 
dread of retaliation, or of prescribed punishment, the 
egoistic gain from association is small; and it becomes 
considerable only as the recognition becomes voluntary — 
that is, more altruistic. Where, as among some of the 
wild Australians, there exists no limit to the right of the 
strongest, and the men fight to get possession of women 
while the wives of one man fight among themselves about 
him, the pursuit of egoistic satisfactions is greatly impeded* 
Besides the bodily pain occasionally given to each by conflict, 
and the more or less of subsequent inability to achieve 
personal ends, there is the waste of energy entailed in 
maintaining readiness for self-defence, and there is the 
accompanying occupation of consciousness by emotions that 
are on the average of cases disagreeable. Moreover, the 
primary end of safety in presence of external foes is ill- 
attained in proportion as there are internal animosities ; 
such furtherance of satisfactions as industrial co-operation 
brings cannot be had; and there is little motive to labour 

/

ALTBUISM VBESUS EGOISM. 207 

for extra .benefits when the products of labour are insecure. 
And from this early stage to comparatively late stages^ we 
may trace in the wearing of arms, in the carrying on of 
&mily feuds, and in the taking of daily precautions for safety, 
the ways in which the egoistic satisfactions of each are 
diminished by deficiency of that altruism which checks 
overt injury of others. 

The private interests of the individual are on the average 
better subserved, not only in proportion as he himself 
refrains from direct aggression, but also, on the average, in 
proportion as he succeeds in diminishing the aggressions of 
his fellows on one another. The prevalance of antagonisms 
among those around, impedes the activities carried on by 
each in pursuit of satisfactions; and by causing disorder 
makes the beneficial results of activities more doubtful. 
Hence, each profits egoistically from the growth of an 
altruism which leads each to aid in preventing or diminishing 
others' violence. 

The Hke holds when we pass to that altruism which 
restrains the undue egoism displayed in breaches of 
contract. General acceptance of the maxim that honesty 
is the best policy, implies general experience that grati- 
fication of the self-regarding feelings is eventually fur- 
thered by such checking of them as maintains equitable 
deaUngs. And here, as before, each is personally interested 
in securing good treatment of his fellows by one another. 
For in countless ways evils are entailed on each by 
the prevalence of fraudulent transactions. As everyone 
knows, the larger the number of a shopkeeper's bills left 

(unpaid by some customers, the higher must be the prices 
which other customers pay. The more manufacturers lose 
by defective raw materials or by carelessness of workmen, 
the more must they charge for i^eir fabrics to buyers. The 
ft less trustworthy people are, the higher rises the rate of 
j interest, the larger becomes the amount of capital hoarded, 
« the greater are the impediments to industry. The further

traders and people in general go beyond their means, and 
hypothecate the property of others in speculation, the more 
serious are those commercial panics which bring disasters 
on multitudes and injuriously affect all. 

This introduces us to yet a third way in which such per- 
sonal welfere as results from the proportioning of benefits 
gained to labours given, depends on the making of certain 
sacrifices for social welfare. The man who, expending his 
energies wholly on private affairs refuses to take trouble 
about public affairs, pluming himself on his wisdom in 
minding his own business, is blind to the fact that his 
own business is made possible only by maintenance of a 
, healthy social state, and that he loses all round by defective 
governmental arrangements. Where there are many like- 
minded with himself — where, as a consequence, offices come 
to be filled by political adventurers and opinion is swayed 
by demagogues — ^where bribery vitiates the administration 
of the law and makes fraudulent State-transactions habitual; 
heavy penalties fall on the community at large, and, among 
others, on those who have thus done everything for self 
and nothing for society. Their investments are insecure ; 
recovery of their debts is difficult ; and even their lives 
are less safe than they would otherwise have been. 

So that on such altruistic actions as are implied, firstly in 
being just, secondly in seeing justice done between others, 
and thirdly in upholding and improving the agencies by 
which justice is administered, depend, in large measure, 
the egoistic satisfactions of each. 

§ 78. But the identification of personal advantage with 
the advantage of fellow-citizens is much wider than this. 
In various other ways the well-being of each rises and falls 
with the well-being of all. 

A weak man left to provide for his own wants, suffers by 
getting smaller amounts of food and other necessaries than 
he might get were he stronger. In a community formed of

ALTRUISM VERSUS EGOISM. 209 

weak men^ who divide their labours and exchange the pro- 
ducts^ all suffer evils from the weakness of their fellows. 
The quantity of each kind of product is made deficient by 
the deficiency of labouring power; and the share each 
gets for such share of his own product as he can afford 
to give^ is relatively small. Just as the maintenance of 
paupers^ hospital patients^ inmates of asylums^ and others 
who consume but do not produce^ leaves to be divided 
among producers a smaller stock of commodities than would 
exist were there no incapables ; so must there be left a 
smaller stock of commodities to be divided^ the greater the 
number of inefficient producers, or the greater the average 
deficiency of producing power. Hence, whatever decreases 
the strength of men in general restricts the gratifications of 
each by making the means to them dearer. 

More directly, and more obviously, does the bodily well- 
being of his fellows concern him ; for their bodily ill-being, 
when it takes certain shapes, is apt to bring similar bodily 
ill-being on him. If he is not himself attacked by cholera, 
or small-pox, or typhus, when it invades his neighbourhood, 
he often suffers a penalty through his belongings. Under 
conditions spreading it, his wife catches diphtheria, or his 
servant is laid up with scarlet fever, or his children take now 
this and now that infectious disorder. Add together the 
immediate and remote evils brought on him year after year 
by epidemics, and it becomes manifest that his egoistic 
satisfactions are greatly furthered by such altruistic activities 
as render disease less prevalent. 

With the mental, as well as with the bodily, states of fellow* 
citizens, his enjoyments are in multitudinous ways bound up. 
Stupidity like weakness raises the cost of commodities. 
Where farming is unimproved, the prices of food are higher 
than they would else be ; where antiquated routine maintains 
itself iti trade, the needless expense of distribution weighs on 
all ; where there is no inventiveness, everyone loses the bene- 
fits which improved appliances diffiise. Other than economic

evils come from the average unintelligence — ^periodically 
tliroagli the manias and panics that arise because traders 
rash in herds all to buy or all to sell ; and habitually through 
the mal-administration of justice, which people and rulers 
aHke disregard while pursuing this or that legislative will-o'- 
the-wisp. Closer and clearer is the dependence of his personal 
satisfactions on others' mental states, which each experiences 
in his household. TJnpunctuality and want of system are 
perpetual sources of annoyance. The unskiKulness of the 
cook causes frequent vexation and occasional indigestion. 
Lack of forethought Iq the housemaid leads to a fall over ^ 
bucket in a dark passage. And inattention to a message 
or forgetfulness in delivering it, entails &ilure in an 
important engagement. Each, therefore, benefits egoistically

I capable workers or good citizens ; but I mean such altruism 
as helps to spread a knowledge of the nature of things and 

. to cultivate the power of applying that knowledge. 

Yet again, each has a private interest in public morals 
and profits by improving them. Not in large ways only, 
by aggressions and breaches of contract, by adulterations 
and short measures, does each suffer from the general 
unconscientiousness; but in more numerous small ways.

by a dishonest builder under supervision of a careless or 
bribed surveyor. To-day workmen employed to rectify it 
bring on bim cost and inconvenience by dawdling; and 
their low standard of work, determined by the unionist 
principle that the better workers must not discredit the 
worse by exceeding them in efficiency, he may trace to 
the immoral belief that the unworthy should fare as 
well as the worthy. To-morrow it turns oat that business 
for the plumber has been provided by damage which the 
bricklayers have done. 

Thus the improvement of others, physically, intellectually, 
and morally, personally concerns each ; since their imper- 
fections tell in raising the cost of all the commodities he 
buys, in increasing the taxes and rates he pays, and in the 
losses of time, trouble, and money, daily brought on him by 
others' carelessness, stupidity, or unconscientiousness. 

§ 79. Very obvious are certain more immediate connexions 
between personal welfare and ministration to the welfare of 
those around. The evils suffered by those whose behaviour 
is unsympathetic, and the benefits to self wfiich unselfish 
conduct brings, show these. 

That anyone should have formulated his experience by 
saying that the conditions to success are a hard heart and a 
sound digestion, is marvellous considering the many proofs 
that success, even of a material kind, greatly depending as it 
does on the good offices of others, is furthered by whatever 
creates goodwill in others. The contrast between the pros- 
perity of those who to but moderate abilities join natures 
which beget friendships by their kindliness, and the adver- 
sity of those who, though possessed of superior faculties and 
greater acquirements, arouse dislikes by their hardness or 
indifference, should force upon all the truth that egoistic 
enjoyments are aided by altruistic actions. 

This increase of personal benefit achieved by benefiting 
others, is but partially achieved where a selfish motive

prompts the seemingly-nnselfisli act: it is fully achieved 
only where the act is really unselfish. Though services 
rendered with the view of some time profitiag by recipro- 
cated services^ answer to a certain extent ; yet^ ordinarily^ 
they answer only to the extent of bringing equivalents of 
reciprocated services. Those which bring more than equi- 
valents are those not prompted by any thoughts of 
equivalents. For obviously it is the spontaneous outflow of 
good naturOj not in the larger acts of life only but in aU its 
details^ which generates in those around the attachments 
prompting unstiated benevolence. 

Besides furthering prosperity^ other-regarding actions 
conduce to self-regarding gratifications by generating a 
genial environment. With the sympathetic being everyone 
feels more sympathy than with others. All conduct them* 
selves with more than usual amiability to a person who 
hourly discloses a lovable nature. Such a one is practically 
surrounded by a world of better people than one who 
is less attractive. If we contrast the state of a man 
possessing all the material means to happiness^ but isolated 
by his absolute egoism, with the state of an altruistic 
man relatively poor in means but rich in friendp, we may 
see that various gratifications not to be purchased by 
.money^comein abundance to the last and are inaccessible to 
(the first. 

While, then, there is one kind of other-regarding action, 
furthering the prosperity of fellow-citizens at large, which 

! admits of being deliberately pursued from motives that are 
remotely self-regarding — the conviction being that personal 
well-being depends in large measure on the well-being of 
society — ^there is an additional kind of other-regarding action 
having in it no element of conscious self-regard, which 
nevertheless conduces greatly to egoistic satisfactions. 

§ 80. Yet other modes exist in which egoism unqualified by 
altruism habitually fails. It diminishes the totality of egoistic

pleasure by diminishing in several directions the capacity 
for pleasure. 

Self.gratifications, considered separately or in the aggre- 
gate, lose their intensities by that too great persistence in 
them which results if they are made the exclusive objects of 
pursuit. The law that function entails waste, and that 
faculties yielding pleasure by their action cannot act inces- 
santly without exhaustion and accompanying satiety, has 
the implication that intervals during which altruistic acti- 
vities absorb the energies, are intervals during which the 
capacity for egoistic pleasure is recovering its full degree. 
The sensitiveness to purely personal enjoyments is main- 
tained at a higher pitch by those who minister to the enjoy- 
ments of others, than it is by those who devote themselves 
wholly to personal enjoyments. 

This which is manifest even while the tide of life is high, 
becomes still more manifest as life ebbs. It is in maturity 
and old age that we especially see how, as egoistic plea- 
sures grow faint, altruistic actions come in to revive them in 
new forms. The contrast between the child's delight in 
the novelties daily revealed, and the indifference which 
comes as the world around grows familiar, until in adult life 
there remain comparatively few things that are greatly 
enjoyed, draws from all the reflection that as years go by 
pleasures pall. And to those who think, it becomes clear 
that only through sympathy can pleasures be indirectly 
gained from things that have ceased to yield pleasures 
directly. In the gratifications derived by parents from the 
gratifications of their offspring, this is conspicuously shown. 
Trite as is the remark that men live afresh in their children, 
it is needful here to set it down as reminding us of the way 
in which, as the egoistic satisfactions in life fade, altruism 
renews them while it transfigures them. 

We are thus introduced to a more general consideration 
-*the egoistic aspect of altruistic pleasure. Not^ indeed,

that this is the place for discussing the question whether 
the egoistic element can be excluded from altruism; noi 
is it the place for distingrfehing between the altruism 
which is pursued with a foresight of the pleasurable 
feeling to be achieved through it, and the altruism which, 
though it achieves this pleasurable feeling, does not make 
pursuit of it a motive. Here we are concerned with the fact 
that, whether knowingly or unknowingly gained, the state 
of mind accompanying altruistic action, being a pleasurable 
state, is to be counted in the sum of pleasures which the 
individual can receive; and in this sense cannot be other than 
egoistic. That we must so regard it is proved on observing 
that this pleasure, like pleasures in general, conduces to the 
physical prosperity of the ego. As every other agreeable 
emotion raises the tide of life, so does the agreeable emotion 
which accompanies a benevolent deed. As it cannot be 
denied that the pain caused by the sight of suflfering, 
depresses the vital functions — sometimes even to the extent 
of arresting the hearths action, as in one who faints on 
seeing a surgical operation; so neither can it be denied 
that the jov felt in witnessing others^ joy exalts the vital 

/ functions. ^Hence, however much we may hesitate to class 

\ altruistic pleasure as a higher kind of egoistic pleasure, we 

V.i^j? / are obliged to recognize the fact that its immediate efEects 

]j in augmenting life and so furthering personal well-being, 

i are like those of pleasures that are directly egoistic^ And 
the corollary drawn must be that pure egoism is, even in its 
immediate results, less successfully egoistic than is the 

f egoism duly qualified by altruism, which, besides achieving 
additional pleasures, achieves also, through raised vitality, 
a greater capacity for pleasures in general. ^ 

That the range of eesthetic gratifications is wider for the 
altruistic nature than for the egoistic nature, is also a truth 
not to be overlooked. The joys and sorrows of human 
beings form a chief element in the subject-matter of art;

215 



and evidently the pleasures whicli art gives increase as 
the fellow-feeling with these joys and sorrows strengthens. 
If we contrast early poetry occupied mainly with war and 
gratifying the savage instincts by descriptions of bloody 
victories, with the poetry of modem times, in which the 
sanguinary forms but a small part while a large part, 
dealing with the gentler aflfections, enlists the feelings of 
readers on behalf of the weak ; we are shown that with the 
development of a more altruistic nature, there has been 
opened a sphere of enjoyment inaccessible to the callous 
egoism of barbarous times. So, too, between the fiction of 
the past and the fiction of the present, there is the difference 
that while the one was almost exclusively occupied with the 
doings of the ruling classes, and found its plots in their 
antagonisms and deeds of violence, the other, chiefly taking 
stories of peaceful life for its subjects, and to a considerable 
extent the life of the humbler classes, discloses a new world 
of interest in the every-day pleasures and pains of ordinary 
people. A like contrast exists between early and late forms 
of plastic art. When not representing acts of worship, 
the wall-sculptures and wall-paintings of the Assyrians 
and Egyptians, or the decorations of temples among the 
Greeks, represented deeds of conquest ; whereas in modem 
times, while the works which glorify destructive activities 
are less numerous, there are increasingly numerous works 
gratifying to the kindlier sentiments of spectators. To 
see that those who care nothing about the feelings of 
other beings are, by implication, shut out from a wide 
range of aasthetic pleasures, it needs but to ask whether men 
who delight in dog-fights may be expected to appreciate 
Beethoven's Adelaida, or whether Tennyson's In Memoriam 
would greatly move a gang of convicts.

upon egoism; and in the course of evolution the reciprocal 
services of the two have been increasing. 

The physical and unconscious self-sacrifice of parents to 
form ofispring, which the lowest living things display from 
hour to hour, shows us in its primitive form the altruism 
which makes possible the egoism of individual life and 
growth. As we ascend to higher grades of creatures, this 
parental altruism becomes a direct yielding up of only part 
of the body, joined with an increasing contribution from the 
remainder in the shape of tissue wasted in efforts made on 
behalf of progeny. This indirect sacrifice of substance, 
replacing more and more the direct sacrifice as parental 
altruism becomes higher, continues to the last to represent 
also altruism which is other than parental ; since this, too, 
implies loss of substance in making efforts that do not bring 
their return in personal aggrandisement. 

After noting how among mankind parental altruism and 
family altruism pass into social altruism, we observed that a 
society, Uke a species, survives only on condition that each 
generation of its members shall yield to the next, benefits 
equivalent to those it has received from the last. And this 
implies that care for the family must be supplemented by 
care for the society. 

Fulness of egoistic satisfactions in the associated state, 

! depending primarily on maintenance of the normal relation 

between efforts expended and benefits obtaiued, which 

underlies all life, implies an altruism which both prompts 

equitable conduct and prompts the enforcing of equity. The 

' well-being of each is involved with the well-being of all in 

sundry other ways. Whatever conduces to their vigour 

[ concerns him ; for it diminishes the cost of everything he 

1 buys. Whatever conduces to their freedom from disease 

> concerns him; for it diminishes his own liability to disease. 

Whatever raises their intelligence concerns him ; for incon- 

\ veniences are daily entailed on him by others^ ignorance or

folly. Whatever raises their moral characters concerns him; 
for at every turn he suffers from the average uncon- 
scientiousness. 

Much more directly do his egoistic satisfactions depend 
on those altruistic activities which enlist the sympathies of 
others. By alienating those around^ selfishnesses loses the 
unbought aid they can render ; shuts out a wide range of 
social enjoyments j and fails to receive those exaltations of 
pleasure and mitigations of pain, which come from men's 
fellow-feeling with those they like. 

Lastly, undue egoism defeats itself by bringing on an 
incapacity for happiness. Purely egoistic gratifications are 
rendered less keen by satiety, even in the earlier part of 
life, and almost disappear in the later; the less satiating 
gratifications of altruism are missed throughout life, and 
especially in that latter part when they largely replace 
egoistic gratifications ; and there is a lack of susceptibility 
to aBsthetic pleasures of the higher orders. 

An indication must be added of the truth, scarcely at all 
recognized, that this dependence of egoism upon altruism 
ranges beyond the limits of each society, and tends ever 
towards universality. That within each society it becomes 
greater as social evolution, implying increase of mutual 
dependence, progresses, needs not be shown ; and it is a 
corollary that as fast as the dependence of societies on one 
another is increased by commercial intercourse, the internal 
welfare of each becomes a matter of concern to the others. 
That the impoverishment of any country, diminishing both 
its producing and consuming powers, tells detrimentally on 
the people of countries trading with it, is a commonplace 
of political economy. Moreover, we have had of late years, 
abundant experience of the industrial derangements through 
which distress is brought on nations not immediately con- 
cerned, by wars between other nations. And if each 
community has the egoistic satisfactions of its members

diminislied by aggressions of neighbouring communities on 
one another^ still more does it have them diminished by its 
I own aggressions. One who marks how, in various parts of 
, the world, the unscrupulous greed of conquest cloaked by 
pretences of spreading the blessings of British rule and 
British religion, is now reacting to the immense detriment of 
the industrial classes at home, alike by increasing expendi- 
ture and paralyzing trade, may see that these industrial 
classes, absorbed in questions about capital and labour, and 
thinking themselves unconcerned in our doings abroad, are 
suffering from lack of that wide-reaching altruism which 
should insist on just dealings with other peoples, civilized or 
savage. And he may also see that beyond these immediate 
evils, they will for a generation to come suffer the evils that 
must flow from resuscitating the type of social organization 
which aggressive activities produce, and from the lowered 
moral tone which is its accompaniment. 

Note. — ^A consideration which has occurred to me since the issue of the 
first edition, I indicate here to ayoid large alteration of the stereotype plates. 

Inheritance of moral, as of physical, traits being admitted, it follows that, 
habitually, egoistic parents have egoistic offspring. What happens ? First, 
the domestic irritations must be relatiyely great ; for the actions of 
selfish children to one another, and to their parents, cause daily aggreissions 
and squabbles. Second, when adult, such children are more likely than others 
to dissatisfy employers, alienate friends, and compromise the family by mis- 
behayiour, or even by crime. Third, beyond the sorrows thus brought on 
them, the parents of such children have eyentually to bear the sorrows of a 
neglected old age. The cruelty shown in extreme degrees by savages who 
leave the decrepid to starve, is shown in a measure by all unsympathetic sons 
and daughters to their unsympathetic fathers and mothers ; and these, in their 
latter days, suffer from transmitted callousness in proportion as they have been 
callous in the treatment of those around. Browning's versified story " Halbert 
and Hob" typifies this truth. 

Of the self-happiness gained by seeking others' happiness, probably the 
largest amount is that due to the strengthening of the altruistic sentiments 
and re-appearance of these strengthened sentiments in offspring; prompting 
them to a conduct which makes parenthood a blessing.

CHAPTER Xni. 

TRIAL AND COMPROMISE, 

§ 82. In the foregoing two chapters the case on behalf 
of Egoism and the case on behalf of Altruism have been 
stated. The two conflict; and we have now to consider 
what verdict ought to be given. 

If the opposed statements are severally valid, or even 
if each of them is valid in part, the inference must be that 
pure egoism and pure altruism are both illegitimate. K the 
maxim — '' Live for self/' is wrong, so also is the maxim—* 
''Live for others.'' Hence a compromise is the only 
possibility. 

.This conclusion, though already seeming unavoidable, I do 
not here set down as proved. The purpose of this chapter 
is to justify it in full ; and I enunciate it at the outset 
because the arguments used will be better understood, if 
the conclusioii to which they converge is in the reader's view. 

How shall we so conduct the discussion as most clearly 
to bring out this necessity for a compromise ? Perhaps 
the best way will be that of stating one of the two claims 
in its extreme form, and observing the implied absurdities. 
To deal thus with the principle of pure selfishness, would 
be to waste space. Every one sees that an unchecked 
satisfaction of personal desires from moment to moment, in 
absolute disregard of all other beings, would cause universal 
conflict and social dissolution. The principle of pure unsel-

fishness, less obviously miscliievoiis, may therefore better be 
chosen. 

There are two aspects under which the doctrine that 
others^ happiness is the true ethical aim presents itself. 
The " others" may be conceived personally, as individuals 
with whom we stand in direct relations ; or they may 
be conceived impersonally, as constituting the community. 
In so far as the self-abnegation implied by pure altruism 
is concerned, it matters not in which sense " others '' is used. 
But criticism will be facilitated by distinguishing between 
these two forms of it. We will take the last form first. 

§ 83. This commits us to an examination of ''the greatest 
happiness principle/' as enunciated by Bentham and his 
followers. The doctrine that "the general happiness'' ought 
to be the object of pursuit, is not, indeed, overtly iden- 
tified with pure altruism. But as, if general happiness 
is the proper end of action, the individual actor must regard 
his own share of it simply as a unit in the aggregate, no 
more to be valued by him than any other unit, it results 
that since this unit is almost infinitesimal in comparison 
with the aggregate, his action, if directed exclusively 
to achievement of general happiness, is, if not absolutely 
altruistic, as nearly so as may be. Hence the theory which 
makes general happiness the immediate object of pursuit, 
may rightly be taken as one form of the pure altruism to 
be here criticized. 

Both as justifying this interpretation and as furnishing a 
definite proposition with which to deal, let me set out by 
quoting a passage from Mr, Mill's Utilitarianism. 

" The Greatest-Happiness Principle," he says, " is a mere form of words 
without rational signification, unless one person's happiness, supposed equal in 
degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted for exactly as 
much as another's. Those conditions being supplied, Bentham's dictum, 
* everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one,* might be written under 
the principle of utility as an explanatory commentary" (p. 91.) 

Now though the meaning of '' greatest happiness '* as an 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



TRIAL AND COMPROMISE. 221 

end, is liere to a certain degree defined, the need for 
further definition is felt the moment we attempt to decide 
on ways of regulating conduct bo as to attain the end. The 
first question which arises is — ^Must we regard this '^greatest 
happiness principle'' as a principle of guidance for the 
community in its corporate capacity, or as a principle of 
guidance for its members separately considered, or both ? 
If the reply is that the principle must be taken as a guide 
for governmental action rather than for individual action, 
we are at once met by the inquiry, — ^What is to be the 
guide for individual action? If individual action is not 
to be regulated solely for the purpose of achieving '^the 
greatest happiness of the greatest number,'' some other 
principle of regulation for individual action is required; 
and ^^ the greatest happiness principle" fails to furnish the 
needful ethical standard. Should it be rejoined that the 
individual in his capacity of political unit, is to take further- 
ance of general happiness as his end, giving' his vote or 
otherwise acting on the legislature with a view to this end, 
and that in so far guidance is supplied to him, there comes 
the further inquiry — Whence is to come guidance for 
the remainder of individual conduct, constituting by far 
the greater part of it ? If this private part of individual 
conduct is not to have general happiuess as its direct aim, 
then an ethical standard other than that offered has still to 
be found. 

Hence, unless pure altruism as thus formulated confesses 
its inadequacy, it must justify itself as a sufficient rule 
for all conduct, individual and social. We will first deal 
with it as the alleged right principle of public policy ; and 
then as the alleged right principle of private action. 

§ 84. On trying to understand precisely the statement 
that when taking general happiness as an end, the rule 
must be — '^everybody to count for one, nobody for more than 
one," there arises the idea of distribution. We can form 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



222 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

no idea of distribntion without thinking of something 
distributed and recipients of this something. That we 
may clearly conceive the proposition we must clearly 
conceive both these elements of it. Let us take first the 
recipients. 

" Everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one.^' 
Does this mean that, in respect of whatever is portioned 
out, each is to have the same share whatever his character, 
whatever his conduct ? Shall he if passive have as much 
as if active ? Shall he if useless have as much as if useful ? 
Shall he if criminal have as much as if virtuous ? If the 
distribution is to be made without reference to the natures 
and deeds of the recipients, then it must be shown that a 
system which equalizes, as far as it can, the treatment of good 
and bad, will be beneficial. If the distribution is not 
to be indiscriminate, then the formula disappears. The some- 
thing distributed must be apportioned otherwise than by 
equal division. There must be adjustment of amounts to 
deserts; and we are left in the dark as to the mode of 
adjustment — ^we have to find other guidance. 

Let us next ask what is the something to be distributed ? 
The first idea which occurs is that happiness itself must be 
divided out among all. Taken literally, the notions that 
the greatest happiness should be the end sought, and that in 
apportioning it everybody should count for one and nobody 
for more than one, imply that happiness is something 
that can be cut up into parts and handed round. This, 
however, is an impossible interpretation. But after 
recognizing the impossibility of it, there returns the 
question — What is it in respect of which everybody is to 
count for one and nobody for more than one ? 

Shall the interpretation be that the concrete means to 
happiness are to be equally divided ? Is it intended that there 
shaU be distributed to all in equal portions the necessaries 
of life, the apphances to comfort, the facilities for amuse- 
ment ? Ag a conception simply, this is more defensible. 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



TRFAL AND COMPROMISE. '^23 

But passing over the question of policy — passing over the 
question whether greatest happiness would ultimately be 
secured by such a process (which it obviously would not) 
it turns out on examination that greatest happiness could 
not even proncimately be so secured. Differences of age, of 
growth, of constitutional need, differences of activity and 
consequent expenditure, differences of desires and tastes, ( 
would entail the inevitable result that the material aids to 
happiness which each received would be more or less un- 
adapted to his requirements. Even if purchasing power were 
equally divided, the greatest happiness would not be achieved 
if everybody counted for one and nobody for more than 
one; since, as the capacities for utilizing the purchased 
means to happiness would vary both with the constitution 
and the stage of life, the means which would approximately 
suffice to satisfy the wants of one would be extremely 
insufficient to satisfy the wants of another, and so the 
greatest total of happiness would not be obtained : means 
might be unequally apportioned in a way that would produce 
* a greater total. 

But now if happiness itself cannot be cut up and 
distributed equally, and if equal division of the material 
aids to happiness would not produce greatest happiness, 
what is the thing to be thus apportioned ? — ^what is it in 
respect of which everybody is to count for one and nobody 
for more than one ? There seems but a single possibility. 
There remain to be equally distributed nothing but the 
conditions under which each may pursue happiness. The 
limitations to action — the degrees of freedom and restraint, 
shall be alike for all. Each shall have as much liberty to 
pursue his ends as consists with maintaining like liberties to 
pursue their ends by others ; and one as much as another 
shall have the enjoyment of that which his efforts, carried on 
within these limits, obtain. But to say that in respect of 
these conditions everybody shall count for one and nobody 
for more than one, is simply to say that equity shall be 
enforced.

224 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

Thus^ considered as a principle of public policy, Bentliam's 

principle, when analyzed, transforms itself into the principle 

he slights. Not general happiness becomes the ethical 

j standard by which legislative action is to be guided, but 

.' nniversal justice. And so the altruistic theory under this , 

form collapses. 

§ 85. From examining the doctrine that general happiness 
should be the end of public action, we pass now to examine 
the doctrine that it should be the end of private action. 

It is contended that from the stand-point of pure reason, 
the happiness of others has no less a claim as an object of 
pursuit for each than personal happiness. Considered as 
parts of a total, happiness felt by self and like happiness felt 
by another, are of equal values ; and hence it is inferred that, 
rationally estimated, the obligation to expend effort for 
others' benefit, is as great as the obligation to expend 'effort 
for one's own benefit. Holding that the utiUtarian system 
of morals, rightly understood, harmonizes with the Christian 
maxim — " Love your neighbour as yourself,^' Mr. Mill says 
that '* as between his own happiness and that of others, 
utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a 
disinterested and benevolent spectator. '^ (p. 24) Let us 
consider the alternative interpretations which may be given 
to this statement. 

Suppose, first, that a certain quantum of happiness has in 
some way become available, without the special instrumen- 
tality of A, B, C, or D, constituting the group concerned. 
Then the proposition is that each shall be ready to have this 
quantum of happiness as much enjoyed by one or more of 
the others as by himself. The disinterested and benevolent 
spectator would clearly, in such a case, rule that no one 
ought to have more of the happiness than another. But 
here, assuming as we do that the quantum of happiness 
has become available without the agency of any 
among the group, simple equity dictates as much. No 
one having in any way established a claim different from 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



TBIAL AND COHFCOHISE. 225 

the claims of others^ tlieir claims are equal; and due regard 
for justice by each will not permit him to monopolize the 
happiness. 

Now suppose a different case. Suppose that the quantum 
of happiness has been made available by the efforts of one 
member of the group. Suppose that A has acquired by 
labour some material aid to happiness. He decides to act 
as the disinterested and benevolent spectator would direct. 
What will he decide? — ^what would the spectator direct? 
Let us consider the possible suppositions ; taking first the 
least reasonable. 

The spectator may be conceived as deciding that the 
labour expended by A in acquiring this material aid to 
happiness^ originates no claim to special use of it; but 
that it ought to be given to B, 0, or D, or that it ought 
to be divided equally among B, C, and D, or that it ought 
to be divided equally among all members of the group^ 
including A who has laboured for it. And if the spec- 
tator is conceived as deciding thus to-day, he must be con- 
ceived as deciding thus day after day ; with the result that 
one of the group expends all the effort, getting either none 
of the benefit or only his numerical share, while the others 
get their shares of the benefit without expending any efforts. 
That A might conceive the disinterested and benevolent 
spectator to decide in this way, and might feel bound to 
act in conformity with the imagined decision, is a strong 
supposition; and probably it will be admitted that sach 
kind of impartiality, so far from being conducive to the 
general happiness, would quickly be fatal to everyone. But 
this is not all. Action in pursuance of such a decision 
would in reality be negatived by the very principle enun- 
ciated. For not only A, but also B, 0, and D, have to act 
on this principle. Each of them must behave as he con- 
ceives an impartial spectator would decide. Does B con- 
ceive the impartial spectator as awarding to him, B, the 
product of A's labour? Then the assumption is that B 

15 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



226 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

conceiyes the impartial spectator as fayonring Mmself^ B^ 
more than A conceiyes him as fayounng himself^ A; 
which is inconsistent with the hypothesis. Does B, in con- 
ceiying the impartial spectator, exclude his own interests as 
completely as A does ? Then how can he decide so much to 
his own adyantage, so partially, as to allow him to take from 
A an equal share of the benefit gained by A's labour, towards 
which he and the rest haye done nothing ? 

Passing from this conceiyable, though not credible, ded- 
sion of the spectator, here noted for the purpose of observ- 
ing that habitual conformity to it would be impossible, there 
remains to be considered the decision which a spectator 
really impartial would giye. He would say that the happi- 
ness, or material aid to happiness, which had been purchase^ 
by A's labour, was to be taken by A. He would say 
that B, G, and D had no claims to it, but only to such happi- 
ness, or aids to happiness, as their respectiye labours had 
purchased. Consequently, A, acting as the imaginary im- 
partial spectator would direct, iS| by this test, justified in 
appropriating such happiness or aid to happiness as his own 
efibrts haye achieyed. 

And so under its spec^l form as under its general form^ 
the principle is true only in so &r as it embodies a dis- 
guised justice. Analysis again briags out the result that 
making ^* general happiness^' the end of action, really means 
maintaining what we call equitable relations among indi- 
viduals. Declitie to accept in itsyague form ^^the greatest- 
happiness principle,'* and insist on knowing what is the im- 
phed conduct, public or. private, and it turns out that the 
principle is meaningless save as iudirectly asserting that 
the claims of each should be duly regarded by all. The 
utilitarian altruism becomes a duly quaUfied egoism. 

§ 86. Another point of view from which to judge the 
altruistic theory may now be taken. If, assumiug the 
proper object of pursuit to be general happiness, we proceed 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



TBIAL AND COMPROMISE. 227 

rationally, we mnst ask in what different ways tte aggregate, 
general happiness, may be composed ; and must then ask 
what composition of it will yield the largest sum. 

Suppose that each citizen pursues his own happiness 
independently, not to the detriment of others but without 
active concern for others ; then their united happinesses 
constitute a certain sum — a certain general happiness. Now 
suppose that each, instead of making his own happiness 
the object of pursuit, makes the happiness of others the 
object of pursuit; then, again, there results a certain 
sum of happiness. This sum must be less than, or equal 
to, or greater than, the first. If it is admitted that this 
sum is either less than the first or only equal to it, the 
altruistic course of action is confessedly either worse than, 
or no better than, the egoistic. The assumption must be 
that the sum of happiness obtained is greater. Let us 
observe what is involved in this assumption. 

If each pursues exclusively the happiness of others-; and 
if each is also a recipient of happiness (which he must be, 
for otherwise no aggregate happiness can be formed out of 
their individual happinesses) ; then the implication is that 
each gains the happiness due to altruistic action exclusively ; 
and that in each this is greater in amount than the egoistic 
happiness obtainable by him, if he devoted himself to pursuit 
of it. Leaving out of consideration for a moment these 
relative amounts of the two, let us note the conditions to 
the receipt of altruistic happiness by each. The sympathetic 
nature gets pleasure by giving pleasure ; and the proposition 
is that if the general happiness is the object of pursuit,* each 
will be made happy by witnessing others' happiness. . But 
what in such case constitutes the happiness of others ? These 
others are also, by the hypothesis, pursuers and receivers of 
altruistic pleasure. The genesis of altruistic pleasure in 
each is to depend on the display of pleasures by others; 
wh ich is again to depend on the display of pleasures by 
others; and so on perpetually. Where, then, is the pleasure 

15*

228 THB DATA OT ETHICS. 

to begin f Obviously there must be egoistic pleasure some- 
wbere, before there can be the altruistic pleasure caused 
by sympathy with it. Obviously, therefore, each must be 
egoistic in due amount, even if only with the view of giving 
others the possibility of being altruistic. So &r from the 
sum of happiness being made greater if all make general 
happiness the exclusive end, the sum disappears entirely. 

How absurd is the supposition that the happiness of all 
can be achieved without each pursuing his own happiness, 
will be best shown by a physical simile. Suppose a cluster 
of bodies, each of which generates heat ; and each of which 
is, therefore, while a radiator of heat to those around, also a 
receiver of heat from them. Manifestly each will have a 
certain proper heat irrespective of that which it gains from 
the rest ; and, each will have a certain heat gained from 
the rest irrespective of its proper heat. What will happen? 
So long as each of the bodies continues to be a generator of 
heat, each continues to maintain a temperature partly derived 
from itself and partly derived from others. But if each ceases 
to generate heat for itself and depends on the heat radiated 
to it by the rest, the entire cluster becomes cold. Well, the 
self-generated heat stands for egoistic pleasure; the heat 
radiated and received stands for sympathetic pleasure; and 
the disappearance of all heat if each ceases to be an originator 
of it, corresponds to the disappearance of aU pleasure if each 
ceases to originate it egoistically. 

A further conclusion may be drawn. Besides the im- 
plication that before altruistic pleasure can ezist, egoistic 
pleasure must exist, and that if the rule of conduct is to be 
the same for aU, each must be egoistic in due degree ; there 
is the implication that, to achieve the greatest sum of 
happiness, each must be more egoistic than altruistic. For, 
speaking generally, sympathetic pleasures must ever con- 
tinjae less intense than the pleasures with which there is 
sympathy. Other things equal, ideal feelings cannot be 
as vivid as real feelings. It is true that those having strong 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



TRIAL AND GOMPBOMISE. 229 

imaginations may^ especially in cases where the affections 
are engaged, feel the moral pain if not the physical 
pain of another, as keenly as the actual sufferer of it, 
and may participate with like intensity in another^s plea- 
sure : sometimes even mentally representing the received 
pleasure as greater than it really is, and so getting 
reflex pleasure greater than the recipients^ direct pleasure. 
Such cases, however, and cases in which even apart 
from exaltation of sympathy caused by attachment, there is 
a body of feeling sympathetically aroused equal in amount 
to the original feeling, if not greater, are necessarily excep- 
tional. For in such cases the total consciousness includes 
many other elements besides the mentally-represented 
pleasure or pain — notably the luxury of pity and the luxury ^ 
of goodness ; and genesis of these can occur but occasion- ( 
ally: they could not be habitual concomitants of sympathetic . 
pleasures if all pursued these from moment to moment. 
In estimating the possible totality of sympathetic pleasures, 
we must include nothing beyond the representations of the 
pleasures others experience. And unless it be asserted 
that we can have other^s states of consciousness perpetually 
re-produced in us more vividly than the kindred states of 
consciousness are aroused in ourselves by their proper 
personal causes, it must be admitted that the totality of 
altruistic pleasures cannot become equal to the totality of 
egoistic pleasures. Hence, beyond the truth that before 
there can be altruistic pleasures there must be the egoistic 
pleasures from sympathy with which they arise, there is the \ 
, truth that, to obtain the greatest sum of altruistic pleasures, f 
there must be a greater sum of egoistic pleasures. 

§ 87. That pure altruism is suicidal may be yet other- 
wise demonstrated. A perfectly moral law must be one 
which becomes perfectly practicable as human nature be- 
comes perfect. If its practicableness decreases as human 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



230 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

nature improves; and if an ideal human nature neces- 
sitates its impracticability; it cannot be the moral law 
sought. 

Now opportunities for practising altruism are numerous 
and great in proportion as there is weakness, or incapacity, 
or imperfection. If we pass beyond the limits of the family, 
in which a sphere for self-sacrificing activities must be pre- 
served as long as offspring have to be reared ; and if we ask 
how there can continue a social sphere for self-sacrificing 
activities ; it becomes obvious that the continued existence 
of serious evils, caused by prevalent defects of nature, is 
implied. As fast as men adapt themselves to the require- 
ments of social life, so fast will the demands for efforts 
on their behalf diminish. And with arrival at finished 
adaptation, when all persons are at once completely self -con- 
served and completely able to fulfil the obligations which 
society imposes on them, those occasions for postponement of 
self to others which pure altruism contemplates, disappear. 

Such self-sacrifices become, indeed, doubly impracticable. 
Carrying on successfully their several lives, men not only can- 
not yield to those around the opportunities for giving aid, but 
aid cannot ordinarily be given them without interfering with 
their normal activities, and so diminishing their pleasures. 
Like every inferior creature, led by its innate desires 
spontaneously to do all that its life requires, man, when 
completely moulded to the social state, must have desires 
so adjusted to his needs that he fulfils the needs in 
gratifying the desires. And if his desires are severally 
gratified by the performance of required acts, none of these 
can be performed for him without balking his desires. 
Acceptance from others of the results of their activities can 
take place only on condition of relinquishing the pleasures 
derived from his own activities. Diminution rather than 
increase of happiness would result, could altruistic action 
in such case be enforced.

And here, indeed, we are introduced to another baseless 
assumption which the theory makes. 

§ 88. The postulate of utilitarianism as formulated in the 
statements above quoted, and of pure altruism as otherwise 
expressed, involves the belief that it is possible for 
happiness, or the means to happiness, or the conditions to 
happiness, to be transferred. Without any specified limita- 
tion the proposition taken for granted is, that happiness in 
general admits of detachment from one and attachment to 
another — that surrender to any extent is possible by one 
and appropriation to any extent is possible by another. 
But a mementos thought shows this to be far from the truth. 
On the one hand, surrender carried to a certain point* is 
extremely mischievous and to a further point fatal ; and on 
the other hand, much of the happiness each enjoys is self- 
generated and can neither be given nor received. 

To assume that egoistic pleasures may be relinquished to 
any extent, is to fall into one of those many errors of ethical 
speculation which result from ignoring the truths of biology. 
When taking the biological view of ethics we saw that plea- 
sures accompany normal amounts of functions, while pains 
accompany defects or excesses of functions ; further, that 
complete life depends on complete discharge of functions, 
and therefore on receipt of the correlative pleasures. Hence, 
to yield up normal pleasures is to yield up so much life ; and 
there arises the question — to what extent may this be done ? 
If he is to continue living, the individual must take certain 
amounts of those pleasures which go along with fulfilment 
of the bodily functions, and mitst avoid the pains which 
entire non-fulfilment of them entails. Complete abnegation 
means death ; excessive abnegation means illness ; abnega* 
tion less excessive means physical degradation and consequent 
loss of power to fulfil obligations, personal and other. 
When, therefore, we attempt to specialize the proposal to live 
not for selE-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of others, we

meet with the difficnlty that beyond a certam limit this 
cannot be done. And when we have decided what decrease 
of bodily welfare, caused by sacrifice of pleasures and 
acceptance of pains, it is proper for the individual to make, 
there is forced on us the fact that the portion of happiness, 
or means to happiness, which it is possible for him to yield 
up for redistribution, is a limited portion. -^ 

Even more rigorous on another side is the restriction put 
upon the transfer of happiness, or the means to happiness. 
The pleasures gained by efficient action — ^by successful 
pursuit of ends, cannot by any process be parted with, and 
cannot in any way be appropriated by another. The habit 
of arguing about general happiness sometimes as though it 
were a concrete product to be portioned out, and sometimes 
as though it were co-extensive with the use of those material 
aids to pleasure which may be given and received, has 
caused inattention to the truth that the pleasures of achieve- 
ment are not transferable. Alike in the boy who has won a 
game of marbles, the athlete who has performed a feat, the 
statesman who has gained a party triumph, the inventor who 
has devised a new machine, the man of science who has 
discovered a truth, the novelist who has well delineated 
a character, the poet who has finely rendered an emotion, 
we see pleasures which must, in the nature of things, be 
enjoyed exclusively by those to whom they come. And 
if we look at all such occupations as men are not impelled to 
by their necessities — if we contemplate the various ambitions 
which play so large a part in life ; we are reminded that so 
long as the consciousness of efficiency remains a dominant 
pleasure, there will remain a dominant pleasure which 
cannot be pursued altruistically but must be pursued 
egoistically. 

Cutting off, then, at the one end, those pleasures which 
are inseparable .firom maintenance of the physique in 
an uninjured state ; and cutting off at the other end the 
pleasures of successful action; the amount that remains is so

greatly diminislied^ as to make untenable the assumption that 
happiness at large admits of distribution after the manner 
which utilitarianism assumes. 

§ 89. In yet one more way may be shown the inconsistency 
of this transfigured utilitarianism which regards its doctrine 
as embodying the Christian maxim — '*Love your neigh- 
bour as yourself/' and of that altruism which, going still 
farther, enunciates the maxim — '' Live for others.^' 

A right rule of conduct must be one which may with 
advantage be adopted by aU. '^Act according to that 
maxim only, which you can wish^ at the same time, to 
become a universal law,'' says Kant. And clearly, passing 
over needful qualifications of this maxim, we may 
accept it to the extent of admitting that a mode of action 
which becomes impracticable as it approaches universality, 
must be wrong. Hence, if the theory of pure altruism, 
implying that eflfort should be expended for the benefit of 
others and not for personal benefit, is defensible, it must be 
shown that it will produce good results when acted upon by 
all. Mark the consequences if all are purely altruistic. 

First, an impossible combination of moral attributes is 
implied: Each is supposed by the hypothesis to regard 
self so little and others so much, that he constajitlj^^sacri- 
fices his o wn pleasures to give pleasures to them. But if 
this is a universal trait, and i£ action is universally con- 
gruous with it, we have to conceive each as being not only 
a sacrificer but also one who accepts sacrifices. While he 
is so unselfish as willingly to yield up the benefit for 
which he has laboured, he is so selfish as mllingly to let 
others yield up to him the benefits they have laboured for. 
To make pure altruism possible for all, each must be at once 
extremely unegoistic and extremely egoistic. As a* giver, 
he must have no thought for self; as a receiver, no thought 
for others. Evidently, this implies an inconceivable mental 
constitution. The sympathy which is so solicitous for others

as willingly to injure self in benefiting them^ cannot at tlie 
same time be so regardless of others as to accept benefits 
which they injure themselves in giving. 

The incongruities that emerge if we assume pure altruism 
to be universally practised^ may be otherwise exhibited 
thus. Suppose that each^ instead of enjoying such pleasures 
as come to him^ or such consumable appliances to pleasure as 
he has worked for, or such occasions for pleasure as reward 
his efforts, relinquishes these to a single other, or adds them 
to a common stock from which others benefit; what will 
result ? Different answers may be given according as we 
assume that there are, or are not, additional influences 
brought into play. Suppose there are no additional 

influences. Then, if each transfers to another his happiness, 
or means to happiness, or occasions for happiness, while some 
one else does the like to him, the distribution of happiness 
is, on the average, unchanged ; or if each adds to a common 
stock his happiness, or means to happiness, or occasions for 
happiness, from which common stock each appropriates his 
portion, the average state is still, as before, unchanged. 
The only obvious effect is that transactions must be gone 
thrpugh in the redistribution ; and loss of time and labour 
must result. Now suppose some additional influence 

which makes the process beneficial ; what must it be ? The 
totality can be increased only if the acts of transfer 
increase the quantity of that which is transferred. The 
happiness, or that which brings it, must be greater to one 
who derives it from another's efforts, than it would have 
been had his own efforts procured it; or otherwise, sup- 
posing a fund of happiness, or of that which brings it, has 
been formed by contributions from each, then each, in 
appropriating his share, must find it larger than it would 
have b^n had no such aggregation and dispersion taken 
place. To justify belief in such increase two conceivable 
assumptions may be made. One is that though the sum of 
pleasures, or of pleasure-yielding things, remains the same.

yet the kind of pleasure, or of pleasure-yielding things, which 
each receives in exchange from another, or from the aggre- 
gate of others, is one which he appreciates more than that 
for which he laboured. But to assume this is to assume 
that each labours directly for the thing which he enjoys less, 
rather than for the thing which he enjoys more, which is 
absurd. The other assumption is that while the exchanged 
or redistributed pleasure of the egoistic kind, remains the 
same in amount for each, there is added to it the altruistic 
pleasure accompanying the exchange. But this assumption ' 
is clearly inadmissible if, as is implied, the transaction is 
universal — ^is one through which each becomes giver and] 
receiver to equal extents. For if the transfer of pleasures, j ] 
or of pleasure-yielding things, from one to another or others, 
is always accompanied by the consciousness that there will 
be received from him or them an equivalent ; there results 
merely a tacit exchange, either direct or roundabout. Each 
becomes altruistic in no greater degree than is implied by 
being equitable; and each, having nothing to exalt his 
happiness, sympathetically or otherwise, caunot be a source 
of sympathetic happiness to others. 

§ 90. Thus, when the meanings of its words are inquired 
into, or when the necessary implications of its theory are 
examined, pure altruism, in whatever form expressed, 
commits its adherents to various absurdities. 

If ^^ the greatest happiness of the greatest number," or 
in other words, " the general happiness," is the proper end 
of action, then not only for all public action but for all 
private action, it must be the end ; because, otherwise, the 
greater part of action remains unguided. Consider its 
fitness for each. If corporate action is to be guided 
by the principle, with its interpreting comment — '' every- 
body to count for one, nobody for more than one" — 
there must be an ignoring of aU differences of character 
and conduct, merits and demerits, among citizens, since

236 THE DATA OF KHICS. 

no discrimination is provided for; and moreover, since 
tliat in respect of which all are to count alike cannot be 
happiness itself, which is indistributable, and since equal 
sharing of the concrete means to happiness, besides failing 
ultimately would fail proximately to produce the greatest 
happiness; it results that equal distribution of the conditions 
under which happiness may be pursued is the pnly tenable 
meaning : we discover in the principle nothing but a round- 
about insistance on equity. If, taking happiness at large as 
the aim of private action, the individual is required to judge 
between his own happiness and that of others as an impar- 
tial spectator would do, we see that no supposition concern- 
iag the spectator save one which suicidally ascribes partiality 
to him, can bring out any other result than that each shall 
eajoy such happiness, or appropriate such means to happi- 
ness, as his own efforts gain: equity is again the sole 
content. When, adopting another method, we consider 
how the greatest sum of happiness may be composed, and, 
recognizing the fact that equitable egoism will produce a 
certain sum, ask how pure altruism is to produce a greater 
sum ; we are shown that if all, exclusively pursuing altruistic v 
pleasures, are so to produce a greater sum of pleasures, 
the implication is that altruistic pleasures, which arise 
from sympathy, can exist in the absence of egoistic plea- 
sures with which there may be sympathy — an impossibility ; 
and another implication is that if, the necessity for egoistic 
pleasures being admitted, it is said that the greatest' sum of 
happiness will be attained if all individuals are more 
altruistic than egoistic, it. is indirectly said that as a genera 
truth, representative feelings are stronger than presentative 
feelings — another impossibility. Again, the doctrine of pure 
altruism assumes that happiness may be to any extent 
transferred or redistributed; whereas the fe-ct is that plea- 
sures of one order cannot be transferred in large measure 
without results which are fatal or extremely injurious, and 
that pleasures of another order canLot be transferred in any

TRIAL AND COHPBOUISE. 237 

degree. Fortlier^ pure altruism presents this fatal anomaly; 
that while a right principle of action must be more and 
more practised as men improve, the altruistic principle 
becomes less and less practicable as men approach an ideal 
form, because the sphere for practising it continually de- 
creases. Finally, its self-destructiveness is made manifest 
on observing that for all to adopt it as a principle of action, 
which they must do if it is a sound principle, implies 
that all are at once extremely unegoistic and extremely 
egoistic — ready to injure self for others' benefit, and ready 
to accept benefit at the cost of injury to others : traits 
which cannot co-exist. 

The need for a compromise between egoism and altruism 
is thus made conspicuous. We are forced to recognize the 
claims which his own well-being has on the attention of eacK 
by noting how, in some directions we come to a deadlock, 
in others to contradictions, and in others to disastrous 
results, if they are ignored. Conversely, it is undeniable 
that disregard of others by each, carried to a great extent 
is fatal to society, and carried to a still greater extent 
is fatal to the family, and eventually to the race. Egoism 
and altruism are therefore co-essential. ^^.^ 

§ 91. What form is the compromise between egoism 
and altruism to assume ? How are their respective claims to 
be satisfied in due degrees f 

It is a truth insisted on by moralists and recognized in 
common life, that the achievement of individual happiness 
is not proportionate to the degree in which individual 
happiness is made the object of direct pursuit ; but there has 
not yet become current the belief that, in like manner, the 
achievement of general happiness is not proportionate to 
the degree in which general happiness is made the object of 
direct pursuit. Yet failure of direct pursuit in the last case 
is more reasonably to be expected than in the first. 

When discussing the relations of means and ends^ we saw

238 THS DATA OF ETHICS. 

that as individual conduct evolves^ its principle becomes 
more and more that of making fulfilment of means the 
proximate end^ and leaving the ultimate end^ welfare or 
happiness^ to come as a result. And we saw that when 
general welfare or happiness is the ultimate end^ the same 
principle holds even more rigorously ; since the ultimate 
end under its impersonal form, is less determinate than 
under its personal form, and the difficulties in the way of 
achieving it by direct pursuit still greater. Recognizing, 
then, the fact that corporate happiness still more than 
individual happiness, must be pursued not directly but 
indirectly, the first question for us is — ^What must be 
the general nature of the means through which it is to 
be achieved. 

It is admitted that self-happiness is, in a measure, to be 
obtained by furthering the happiness of others. May it 
not be true that, conversely, general happiness is to be 
obtained by furthering self-happiness ? If the well-being of 
each unit is to be reached partly through his care for the 
well-being of the aggregate, is not the well-being of the 
aggregate to be reached partly through the care of 
each unit for himself? Clearly, our conclusion must be that 
general happiness is to be achieved mainly through the 
adequate pursuit of their own happinesses by individuals ; 
while, reciprocally, the happinesses of individuals are to be 
ffcchieved in part by their pursuit of the general happiness. 

And this is the conclusion embodied in the progressing 
ideas and usages of mankind. This compromise between 
egoism and altruism has been slowly establishing itself; 
and towards recognition of its propriety, men's actual 
beliefs, as distinguished from their nominal beliefs, have 
been gradually approaching. Social evolution has been 
bringing about a state in which the claims of the individual 
to the proceeds of his activities, and to such satisfactions ad 
they bring, are more and more positively asserted ; at the 
same time that insistance on others' claiina and habitual

respect for them^ have been increasing. Among the rodest 
savages personal interests are very vaguely distinguished 
from the interests of others. In early stages of civiliza- 
tion, the proportioning of benefits to efforts is extremely 
rude : slaves and serfs get for work, arbitrary amounts of 
food and shelter : exchange being infrequent, there is little 
to develop the idea of equivalence. But as civilization 
advances and status passes into contract, there comes daily 
experience of the relation between advantages enjoyed and 
labour given : the industrial system maintaining, through 
supply and demand, a due adjustment of the one to the 
other. And this growth of voluntary co-operation — this 
exchange of services ui^der agreement, has been necessarily 
accompanied by decrease of aggressions one upon another, 
and increase of sympathy : leading to exchange of services 
beyond agreement. That is to say, the more distinct asser* 
tion of individual claims and more rigorous apportioning 
of personal enjoyments to efibrts expended, have gone hand 
in hand with growth of that negative altruism shown in 
equitable conduct and that positive altruism shown in 
gratuitous aid. 

A higher phase of this double change has in our own 
times becomes conspicuous. If, on the one hand, we note 
the struggles for political freedom, the contests between 
labour and capital, the judicial reforms made to facilitate 
enforcement of rights, we see that the tendency still is 
towards complete appropriation by each of whatever benefits 
are due to him, and consequent exclusion of his fellows 
from such benefits. On the other hand, if we consider 
what is meant by the surrender of power to the masses, 
the abolition of class-privileges, the efforts to diffuse know- 
ledge, the agitations to spread temperance, the multitudinous 
philanthropic societies; it becomes clear that regard for the 
well-being of others is increasing ^ari passu with the taking 
of means to secure personal well-being. 

What holds of the relations within each society holds to

some extent^ if to a less extent, of the relations between 
societies. Though to maintain national claims^ real or 
imaginary, often of a trivial kind, the civilized still make 
war on one another; yet their several nationalities are more 
respected than in past ages. Though by victors portions of 
territory are taken and money compensations exacted ; yet 
conquest is not now, as of old, habitually followed by entire 
appropriation of territories and enslavement of peoples. 
The individuahties of societies are in a larger measure 
preserved. Meanwhile the altruistic intercourse is greater : 
aid is rendered on occasions of disaster by flood, by fire, by 
famine, or otherwise. And in international arbitration as 
lately exemplified, implying the recognition of claims by one 
nation upon another, we see a further progress in this wider 
altruism. Doubtless there is much to be said by way of 
set-oflF; for in the dealings of the civilized with the un- 
civilized, little of this progress can be traced. It may be 
urged that the primitive rule — "Life for life,'' has been 
developed by us into the rule — '^ For one life many lives,'' 
as in the cases of Bishop Patteson and Mr. Birch; but 
then there is the qualifying fact that we do not torture our 
prisoners or mutilate them. If it be said that as the 
Hebrews thought themselves warranted in seizing the lands 
I God promised to them, and in some cases exterminating 
j the inhabitants, so we, to fulfil the '' manifest intention of 
Providence," dispossess inferior races whenever we want 
; their territories; it may be replied that we do not kill 
I many more than seems needful, and tolerate the existence 
( of those who submit. And should any one point out that as 
.' Attila, while conquering or destroying peoples and nations, 
i regarded himself as ^^the scourge of God," punishing men 
for their sins, so we, as represented by a High Commis- 
i sioner and a priest he quotes, think ourselves called on to 
• chastise with rifles and cannon, heathens who practise poly- 
gamy ; there is the rejoinder that not even the most ferocious 
.. disciple of the teacher of mercy would carry his vengeance

80 far as to depopulate whole territories and erase scores of 
cities. And when^ on the other hand^ we remember that 
there is an Aborigines Protection Society, that there are 
Commissioners in certain colonies appointed to protect 
native interests, and that in some cases the lands of natives 
have been purchased in ways which, however unfair, have 
implied some recognition of their claims ; we may say that 
little as the compromise between egoism and altruism has 
progressed in international affairs, it has still progressed 
somewhat in the direction indicated.

CHAPTER XIV. 

CONCILIATION. 

§ 92. As exlibited in the last chapter^ the compromise 
between the claims of self and the claims of others seems to 
imply permanent antagonism between the two. The pnrsuit 
by each of his own happiness while paying dne regard to the 
happiness of his fellows, apparently necessitates the ever- 
recurring question — ^how far must the one end be sought 
and how far the other : suggesting, if not discord in the 
life of each, still, an absence of complete harmony. This is 
not the inevitable inference however. 

When, in the Principles of Sociology, Part III, the pheno- 
mena of race-maintenance among living things at large 
were discussed, that the development of the domestic 
relations might be the better understood, it was shown 
that during evolution there has been going on a concilia- 
tion between the interests of the species, the interests 
of the parents, and the interests of the offspring. Proof 
was given that as we ascend from the lowest forms 
of life to the highest, race-maintenance is achieved with 
a decreasing sacrifice of life, alike of young individuals 
and of adult individuals, and also with a decreasing 
sacrifice of parental lives to the lives of offspring. We 
saw that, with the progress of civilization, like changes 
go on among human beings ; and that the highest domestic 
relations are those in which the conciliation of welfares

^within the family becomes greatest, while the welfare of the 
society is best subserved. Here it remains to be shown that 
a kindred conciliation has been, and is, taking place between 
the interests of each citizen and the interests of citizens 
at large; tending ever towards a state, in which the two 
become merged in one, and in which the feelings answering 
to them respectively, fall into complete concord. 

In the fiamily group, even a9 we observe it among many 
inferior vertebrates, we see that the parental sacrifice, now 
become so moderate in amount as to consist with long- 
continued parental life, is not accompanied by consciousness 
of sacrifice ; but, contrariwise, is made from a direct desire 
to make it : the altruistic labours on behalf of young are 
carried on in satisfaction of parental instincts. If we trace 
these relations up through the grades of mankind, and 
observe how largely love rather than obligation promptg^ 
the care of children, we see the conciliation of interests to 
be such that achievement of parental happiness coincides 
with securing the happiness of ofispring: the wish for 
children among the childless, and the occasional adoption 
of children, showing how needful for attainment of certain 
egoistic satisfactions are these altruistic activities. And 
further evolution, causing along with higher nature dimi- 
nished fertility, and therefore smaller burdens on parents, 
may be expected to bring a state in which, far more than 
now, the pleasures of adult life will consist in raising 
offspring to perfection while simultaneously furthering the 
immediate happiness of offspring. 

Now though altruism of a social kind, lacking certain 
elements of parental altruism, can never attain the same 
level ; yet it may be expected to attain a level at which it 
will be like parental altruism in spontaneity — a level such 
that ministration to others' happiness will become a daily 
need — a level such that the lower egoistic satisfactions 
will be continually subordinated to this higher egoistic satis- 
faction, not by any effort to subordinate them, but by the

244 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

preference for this higher egoistic satisfaction whenever 
it can be obtained. 

Let us consider how the development of sympathy, which 
. must advance as fast as conditions permit^ will bring about 
this state. 

§ 93. We have seen that during the evolution of life, 
pleasures and pains have necessarily been the incentives to 
and deterrents from, actions which the conditions of exist- 
ence demanded and negatived. An implied truth to be 
here noted is, that faculties which, under given conditions, 
yield partly pain and partly pleasure, cannot develop beyond 
the limit at which they yield a surplus of pleasure : if beyond 
that limit more pain than pleasure results from exercise of 
them, their growth must be arrested. 

Through sympathy both these forms of feeling are 
excited. Now a pleasurable consciousness is aroused on 
witnessing pleasure ; now a painful consciousness is aroused 
on witnessing pain. Hence, if beings around him habitually 
manifest pleasure and but rarely pain, sympathy yields to 
. its possessor a surplus of pleasure ; while, contrariwise, if 
little pleasure is ordinarily witnessed and much pain, sym- 
pathy yields a surplus of p»in ^'its possessor. The average 
development of sympathy must, therefore, be regulated by 
the average manifestations of pleasure and pain in others. 
If the life usually led under given social conditions is such 
that suflFering is daily inflicted, or is daily displayed by asso- 
ciates, sympathy cannot grow : to assume growth of it is 
to assume that the constitution will modify itself in such 
way as to increase its pains and therefore depress its ener- 
gies ; and is to ignore the truth that bearing any kind of pain 
gradually produces insensibility to that pain, or callousness. 
On the other hand, if the social state is such that manifes- 
tations of pleasure predominate, sympathy will increase; 
since sympathetic pleasures, adding to the totality of 
. pleasures enhancing vitality, conduce to the physical pros-

CONCILIATION. 2t5 

perity of the most sympathetic, and since the pleasures of' 
sympathy exceeding its pains in all, lead to an exercise of it 
which strengthens it. 

The first implication is one already more than once 
indicated. We have seen that along with habitual militancy 
and under the adapted type of social organization, sympathy 
cannot develop to any considerable height. The destructive 
activities carried on against external enemies sear it; the 
state of feeling maintained causes within the society itself 
frequent acts of aggression or cruelty; and further, the 
compulsory co-operation characterizing the militant regime 
necessarily represses sympathy — exists only on condition 
of an unsympathetic treatment of some by others. 

But even could the militant regime forthwith end, the 
hindrances to development of sympathy would still be 
great. Though cessation of war would imply increased 
adaptation of man to social life, and decrease of sundry 
evils, yet there would remain much non-adaptation and much 
consequent unhappiness. In the first place, that form of 
nature which has generated and still generates wars, though 
by implication raised to a higher form, would not at once 
be raised to so high a form that there would cease all in- 
justices and the pains they cause. For a considerable period 
after predatory activities had ended, the defects of the pre- 
datory nature would continue: entailing their slowly- 
diminishing evils. In the second place, the ill-adjustment 
of the human constitution to the pursuits of industrial life, 
must long persist, and may be expected to survive in a 
measure the cessation of wars: the required modes of 
activity must remain for innumerable generations in some 
degree displeasurable. And in the third place, deficiencies 
of self-control such as the improvident show us, as well 
as those many failures of conduct due to inadequate 
foresight of consequences, though less marked than now, 
could not fail still to produce sufEering. 

Nor would even complete adaptation, if limited to^

246 THS DATA or BTHICS. 

disappearance of the non-adaptations jost indicated^ remove 
all sources of those miseries which^ to the extent of their 
manifestation^ check the growth of sympathy. For while 
the rate of multiplication continues so to exceed the rate of 
mortality as to cause pressure on the means of subsistence^ 
there must continue to result much unhappiness ; either from 
balked aflTections or from over-work and stinted means. 
Only as fast as fertility diminishes^ which we have seen it 
mus^^o along with further mental development {Principles 
qf Biology, § § 367 — 377), can there go on such diminution 
of the labours required for efficiently supporting self and 
family, that they will not constitute a displeasurable tax on 
the en^gies. 

Gradually then, and only gradually, as these various 
causes of unhappiness become less can sympathy become 
greater. Life would be intolerable if, while the causes of 
misery remained as they now are, all men were not only in a 
high degree sensitive to the pains, bodily and mental, felfc by 
those around and expressed in the faces of those they met, 
but were unceasingly conscious of the miseries every- 
where being suffered as consequences of war, crime, mis- 
conduct, misfortune, improvidence, incapacity. But, as the 
moulding and re-moulding of man and society into mutual 
fitness progresses, and as the pains caused by unfitness 
decrease, sympathy can increase in presence of the pleasures 
that come from fitness. The two changes are indeed so 
related that each furthers the other. Such growth of 
sympathy as conditions permit, itself aids in lessening pain 
and augmenting pleasure; and the greater surplus of 
pleasure that results makes possible further growth of 
sympathy. 

§ 94. The extent to which syijapathy may develop when 
the hindrances are removed, will be better conceived after 
observing the agencies through which it is excited, and 
setting down the reasons for expecting those agencies to

become more efficient. Two factors have to be considered 
—the natural language of feeling in the being sympathized 
with, and the power of interpreting that language in the 
being who sympathizes. We may anticipate development of 
both. 

Movements of the body and facial changes are visible 
effects of feeling which, when the feeling is strong, are 
uncontrollable. When the feeling is less strong however, 
be it sensational or emotional, they may be wholly or par- 
tially repressed ; and there is a habit, more or less constant, 
of repressing them : this habit being the concomitant of a 
nature such that it is often undesirable that others 
should see what is felt. So necessary with • our existing 
characters and conditions are concealments thus prompted, 
that they have come to form a part of moral duty; and 
concealment for its own sake is often insisted upon as an 
element in good manners. All this is caused by the prevalence 
of feelings at variance with social good — ^feelings which 
cannot be shown without producing discords or estrange- 
ments. But in proportion as the egoistic desires fall, 
more under control of the altruistic, and there come fewer 
and slighter impulses of a kind to be reprobated, the need 
for keeping guard over facial expression and bodily move- 
ment will decrease, and these will with increasing clearness 
convey to spectators the mental state. Nor is this all. 
B^estrained as its use is, this language of the emotions is at 
present prevented from growing. But as fast as the emo- 
tions become such that they maybe more candidly displayed, 
there will go, along with the habit of display, development 
of the means of display; so that besides the stronger 
emotions, the more delicate shades and smaller degrees 
of emotion will visibly exhibit themselves: the emotional 
language will become at once more copious, more varied,, 
more definite. And obviously sympathy will be propor- 
tionately facilitated. 

An equally important, if not a more important, advance of

kindred nature^ is to be anticipated. The vocal signs of 
sentient states will simultaneously evolve further. Loudness 
of tone^ pitch of tone^ quality of tone^ and change of tone^ 
are severally marks of feeUng; and^ combined in different 
-ways and proportions^ serve to express different amounts and 
kinds of feelings. As elsewhere pointed out^ cadences are 
the comments of the emotions on the propositions of the 
intellect.* Not in excited speech only, but in ordinary 
speech, we show by ascending and descending intervals, by 
degrees of deviation from the medium tone, as well as by 
place and strength of emphasis, the kind of sentiency which 
accompanies the thought expressed. Now the manifestation 
of feeling by cadence, like its manifestation by visible 
changes, is at present under restraint : the motives for 
repression act in the one case as they act in the other. A 
double effect is produced. This audible language of feeling 
is not used up to the limit of its existing capacity ; and 
it is to a- considerable degree misused, so as to convey 
other feelings than those which are felt. The result of this 
disuse and misuse is to check that evolution which normal 
use would cause. We must infer, then, that as moral adapta- 
tion progresses, and there is decreasing need for conceal- 
ment of the feelings, their vocal signs will develop much 
further. Though it is not to be supposed that cadences 
will ever convey emotions as exactly as words convey 
thoughts, yet it is quite possible that the emotional language 
of the future may rise as much above our present emotional 
language, as our intellectual language has already risen 
above the intellectual language of the lowest races. 

A simultaneous increase in the power of interpreting both 
visible and audible signs of feeling must be taken into 
account. Among those aroimd we see differences both of 
ability to perceive such signs and of ability to conceive the 
implied mental states and their causes : here, a stolidity un-

impressed by a slight facial change or altered tone of yoice^ 
or else unable to imagine what is felt ; and there, a 
quick observation and a penetrating intuition, making 
instantly comprehensible the state of mind and its 
origin. If we suppose both these faculties exalted— 
both a more delicate perception of the signs and a 
strengthened constructive imagination — ^we shall get some 
idea of the deeper and wider sympathy that will hereafter 
arise. More vivid representations of the feelings of others, 
implying ideal excitements of feelings approaching to real 
excitements, must imply a greater likeness between the 
feelings of the sympathizer and those of the sympathized 
with : coining near to identity. 

By simultaneous increase of its subjective and objective 
&ctors, sympathy may thus, as the hindrances diminish, 
rise above that now shown by the sympathetic as much as in 
them it has risen above that which the callous show. 

§ 95. What must be the accompanying evolution of 
conduct? What must the relations between egoism and 
altruism become as this form of nature is neared ? 

A conclusion drawn in the chapter on the relativity 
of pleasures and pains, and there emphasized as one to be 
borne in mind, must now be recalled. It was pointed out 
that, supposiQg them to be consistent with continuance of 
life, there are no activities which may not become sources of 
pleasure, if surrounding conditions require persistence in 
them. And here it is to be added, as a corollary, that if the 
conditions require-a ny cla sy of activities to be relatively 
great, there will arise a relatively great pleasure accompany- 
ing that class of activities. What bearing have these general 
inferences on the special question before us ? 

That alik6 for public welfare and private welfare sympathy 
is essential, we have seen. We have seen that co-operation 
and the benefits which it brings to each and all, become 
high in proportion as the altruistic, that is the sympathetic^

interests extend. The actiona prompted by fellow-feeling 
are thus to be counted among those demanded bj social 
conditions. They are actions -which maintenance and further 
development of social organization tend ever to increase; 
and therefore actions with which there will be joined an 
increasing pleasure. From the laws of life it must be con- 
cluded that unceasing social discipline will so mould human 
nature, that eventually sympathetic pleasures will be sponta- 
neously pursued to the fullest extent advantageous to each 
and all. The scope for altruistic activities will not exceed 
the desire for altruistic satisfactions. 

In natures thus constituted, though the altruistic gratifi- 
cations must remain in a transfigured sense egoistic, yet 
they will not be egoistically pursued — will not be pursued 
from egoistic motives. Though pleasure will be gained by 
giving pleasure, yet the thought of the sympathetic pleasure 
to be gained will not occupy consciousness, but only the 
thought of the pleasure given. To a great extent this is so 
now. In the truly sympathetic, attention is so absorbed 
with the proximate end, others' happiness, that there is 
none given to the prospective self-happiness which may 
ultimately result. An analogy will make the relation clear. 
. A miser accumulates money, not deliberately saying to 
himself— '^ I shall by doing this get the delight which 
possession gives." He thinks only of the money and the 
means of getting it; and he experiences incidentally the 
pleasure that comes from possession. Owning property is 
that which he revels in imagining, and not the feeling which 
owning property will cause. Similarly, one who is sym- 
pathetic in the highest sense, is mentally engaged solely 
in representing pleasure as experienced by another; and 
pursues it for the benefit of that other, forgetting any 
participation he will have in it. Subjectively considered, 
then, the conciliation of egoism and altruism will eventually 
become such that though the altruistic pleasure, as being a 
part of .the consciousness of one who experiences it, can

CONCILIATION. 251 

never be other than egoistic^ it -mil not be consciously 
egoistic. 

Let us now ask what must happen in a socieiy composed 
of persons constituted in this mauner. 

§ 96. The opportunities for that postponement of self to 
others which constitutes altruism as ordinarily conceived^ 
mast, in several ways^ be more and more limited as the 
highest state is approached. 

Extensive demands on the benevolent, presuppose much 
unhappiness. Before there can be many and large calls on 
some for efforts on behalf of others, there must be many 
others in conditions needing help — in conditions of com- 
parative misery. But, as we have seen above, the develop- 
ment of fellow-feeling can go on only as fast as misery 
decreases. Sympathy can reach its full height only when 
there have ceased to be frequent occasions for anything like 
serious self-sacrifice. 

Change the point of view, and this truth presents itself 
under another aspect. We have already seen that with the 
progress of adaptation, each becomes so constituted thfit he 
cannot be helped without in some way arresting a pleasur- 
able activity. There cannot be a beneficial interference 
between faculty and function when the two are adjusted. 
Consequently, in proportion as mankind approach complete 
adjustment of their natures to social needs, there must be 
fewer and smaller opportunities for giving aid. 

Yet again, as was pointed out in the last chapter, the 
sympathy which prompts efforts for others^ welfare must be 
pained by self-injury on the part of others ; and must, there- 
fore, cause aversion to accept benefits derived from Sieir 
self -injuries. What is to be inferred ? While each when 
occasion offers is ready, anxious even, to surrender egoistic 
satisfactions; others, similarly-natured, cannot but resist 
the surrender. If anyone, proposing to treat himself more 
hardly than a disinterested spectator would direct, refrains

from appropriating that wliich is due, others^ caring for him 
if he wiU not care for himself, must necessarfly insist that 
he shall appropriate it. General ahroism then, in its 
deyeloped form, mnst ineritablj resist individaal excesses 
of altruism. The relation at present &miliar to ns wiU be 
inserted; and instead of each Tnaintaining his own claims, 
others will maintain his claims for him: not, indeed, by 
actiye effort, which will be needless, but by passively resist- 
ing any nndne yielding np of them. There is nothing in 
snch behaviour which is not even now to be traced in our 
daily experiences as beginning. In business transactions 
amon^ honourable men, there is usually a desire on either 
side that the other shall treat himself &irly. Not unfre- 
quently, there is a refusal to take something regarded 
as the other's due, but whicb the other offers to give up. 
In social intercourse, too, the cases are common in which 
those who would surrender their shares of pleasure are not 
permitted by the rest to do so. Further development of 
sympathy cannot but make this mode of behaving in- 
creasingly general and increasingly genuine. 

Certain complex restraints on excesses of altruism exist, 
which, in another way, force back the j^vidual upon a 
normal egoism. Two may here be noted. In the first 

place, self-abtiegations often repeated imply on the part of the 
actor a tacit ascription of relative selfishness to others who 
profit by the self-abnegations. Even with men as they are^ 
there occasionally arises a feeling among those for whom 
sacrifices are frequently made, that they are being insulted 
by the assumption that they are ready to receive them ; and 
in the mind of the actor also, there sometimes grows up a 
recognition of this feeling on their part, and a consequent 
check on his too great or too frequent surrenders of pleasure. 
Obviously in more developed natures, this kind of check must 
act still more promptly. In the second place, when, as 

the hypothesis implies, altruistic pleasures have reached a 
greater intensity than they now possess, each person will be

CONCILTATION. 253 

debarred from undue pursuit of them by the consciousness 
that other persons, too, desire them, and that scope for 
others' enjoyment of them must be left. Even now 
may be observed among groups of friends, where some 
competition in amiabiUty is going on, relinquishments p{ 
opportunities for self-abnegation that others may have 
them'. ''Let her give up the gratification, she will like to do 
BO ; '* '' Let him undertake the trouble, it will please him ; '' 
are suggestions which from time to time illustrate this 
consciousness. The most developed sympathy will care for 
the sympathetic satisfactions of others as well as for their 
selfish satisfactions. What may be called a higher equity 
will refrain from trespassing on the spheres of others' 
altruistic activities, as a lower equity refrains from tres- 
passing on the spheres of their egoistic activities. And 
by this checking of what may be called an egoistic altruism, 
undue sacrifices on the part of each must be prevented. 

What spheres, then, will eventually remain for altruism as 
it is commonly conceived ? There are three. One of them 
must to the last continue large in extent; and the others 
must progressively diminish, though they do not dis- 
appear. #H|t^ first is that which family-life afibrds. 
Always there must be a need for subordination of self- 
regarding feelings to other-regarding feelings in the rearing 
of children. Though this will diminish with diminution in 
the number to be reared, yet it will increase with the 
greater elaboration and prolongation of the activities on 
their behalf. But as shown above, there is even now partially 
effected a conciliation such that those egoistic satisfac- 
tions which parenthood yields are achieved through altruistic 
activities — a conciliation tending ever towards completeness. 
An important developement- of family-altruism must be 
added : the reciprocal care of parents by children during old 
age— a care becoming lighter and better fulfilled, in which 
a kindred conciliation may be looked for. Pursuit 
of social welfare at large must afford hereafter, as it

does iiow^ scope for the postponement of selfish interests 
to unselfish interests^ but a continaally lessening scope; 
because as adaptation to the social state progresses^ 
the needs for those regulative actions by which social life 
is made harmonious become less. And here the amount of 
altruistic action which each undertakes must inevitably be 
kept within moderate bounds by others; for if they are 
similarly altruistic, they will not allow some to pursue 
public ends to their own considerable detriment that the 
rest may profit. In the private relations of men, 

opportunities for self sacrifice prompted by sympathy, must 
ever in some degree, though eventually in a small degree, 
be afforded by accidents, diseases, and misfortunes in 
general ; since, however near to completeness the adaptation 
of human nature to the conditions of existence at large, 
physical and social, may become, it can never reach com- 
pleteness. Flood, fire, and wreck must to the last yield at 
intervals opportunities for heroic acts ; and in the motives to 
such acts, anxiety for others will be less alloyed with love of 
admiration than now. Extreme, however, as may be the eager- 
ness for altruistic action on the rare occasions hence arising, 
the amount falling to the share of each must, for the reasons 
given, be narrowly limited. But though in the 

incidents of ordinary life, postponements of self to others 
in large ways must become very infrequent, daily inter- 
course will still furnish multitudinous small occasions for 
the activity of fellow feeling. Always each may continue 
to further the welfare of others by warding off from them 
evils they cannot see, and by aiding their actions in ways un- 
known to them ; or, conversely putting it, each may have, as 
it were, supplementary eyes and ears in other persons, which 
perceive for him things he cannot perceive himself : so per- 
fecting his life in numerous details, by making its adjust- 
ments to environing actions complete. 

§ 97. Must it then follow that eventually, with this dimi- 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



CONCILUTION. 255 

nntion of the spheres for it, altruism must diminisli in total 
amoTint? By no means. Such a conclusion implies a mis- 
conception. 

Naturally, under existing conditions^ with suflfering widely 
diffused and so much of effort demanded from the more for- 
tunate in succouring the less fortunate^ altruism is under- 
stood to mean only selE-sacrifice ; or, at any rate, a mode of 
action which, while it brings some pleasure, has an accom- 
paniment of self-surrender that is not pleasurable. But the 
sympathy which prompts denial of self to please others, is a 
sympathy which also receives pleasure from their pleasures 
when they are otherwise originated. The stronger the fellow- 
feeling which excites efforts to make others happy, the 
stronger is the fellow-feeling with their happiness however 
caused. 

In its ultimate form, then, altruism will be the achieve- 
ment of gratification through sympathy with those gratifica- 
tions of others which are mainly produced by their activities 
of all kinds successfully carried on — sympathetic gratifica- 
tion which costs the receiver nothing, but is a gratis addition 
to his egoistic gratifications. This power of representing 
in idea the mental states of othersTwiiich, during the process 
of adaptation has had the function of mitigating suffering, 
must, as the suffering falls to a minimum, come to have 
almost wholly the function of mutually exalting men's 
enjoyments by giving everyone a vivid intuition of his 
neighbour's enjoyments. While pain prevails widely, it is 
undesirable that each should participate much in the con- 
sciousnesses of others ; but with an increasing predominance 
of pleasure, participation in others' consciousnesses becomes 
a gain of pleasure to all. 

And so there will disappear that apparently-permanent / 
opposition between egoism and altruism, implied by the/ 
compromise reached in the last chapter. Subjectively : 
looked at, the conciliation will be such that the individual ' 
will not have to balance between selE-regarding impulses

256 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

and other-regarding impulses; bnt^ instead^ those satis- 
factions of other-regarding impulses which involve self- 
sacrifice^ becoming rare and much prized, will be so unhesi- 
tatingly preferred that the competition of self -regarding 
impulses with them will scarcely be felt. And the subjective 
conciliation will also be such that though altruistic pleasure 
will be attained, yet the motive of action will not consciously 
be the attainment of altruistic pleasure; but the idea 
present will be the securing of others' pleasures. Meanwhile, 
the conciliation objectively considered will be equally 
complete. Though each, no longer needing to maintain his 
egoistic claims, will tend rather when occasion offers to 
» ^surrender them, yet others, similarly natured, will not 
Siprmit him in any large measure to do this; and that 
fl^pljpent of personal desires required for completion of his 
life^will thus be secured to him : though nob now egoistic 
in the ordinary sense, yet the effects of due egoism will be 
achieved. Nor is this all. As, at an earlier stage, egoistic 
competition, first reaching a compromise such that each 
claims no more than his equitable share, afterwards rises to 
a conciliation such that each insists on the taking of 
equitable shares by others ; so, at the latest stage, altruistic 
competition, first reaching a compromise under which each 
restrains himself from taking an undue share of altruistic 
satisfactions, eventually rises to a conciliation under which 
each takes care that others shall have their opportunities 
for altruistic satisfactions : the highest altruism being that 
which ministers not to the egoistic satisfactions of others 
only, but also to their altruistic satisfactions. 

Par off as seems such a state, yet every one of the factors 
counted on to produce it may already be traced in 
operation among those of highest natures. What now in 
them is occasional and feeble, may be expected with further 
evolution to become habitual and strong; and what now 
characterizes the exceptionally high may be expected 
eventually to characterize all. For that which the best

human nature is capable of, is within the reach of human 
nature at large. 

§ 98. That these conclusions will meet with any considerable 
acceptance is improbable. Neither with current ideas nor 
with current sentiments are they sufficiently congruous. 

Such a view will not be agreeable to those who lament 
the spreading disbelief in eternal damnation ; nor to those 
who follow the apostle of brute force in thinking that because 
the rule of the strong hand was once good it is good for all 
time ; nor to those whose reverence for one who told them 
to put up the sword, is shown by using the sword to spread 
his doctrine among heathens. From the ten thousand 
priests of the religion of love, who are silent when the 
nation is moved by the religion of hate, will come no sign 
of assent ; nor from their bishops who, far from urging the 
extreme precept of the master they pretend to follow, to 
turn the other cheek when one is smitten, vote for acting 
on the principle — strike lest ye be struck. Nor will any 
approval be felt by legislators who, after praying to be 
forgiven their trespasses as they forgive the trespasses of 
others, forthwith decide to attack those who have not tres- 
passed against them; and who, after a Queen's Speech 
has invoked "the blessing of Almighty God'' on their 
councils, immediately provide means for committing political 
burglary. 

But though men who profess Christianity and practise 
Paganism can feel no sympathy with such a view, there are 
some, classed as antagonists to the current creed, who 
may not think it absurd to believe that a rationalized 
version of its ethical principles will eventually be acted 
upon.

CHAPTBE XV. 

ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE BTEnEGS. 

$ 99. As applied to Etlics, the word ''absolute'* will by 
many be supposed to imply principles of right conduct 
that exist out of relation to life as conditioned on the 
Earth — out of relation to time and place^ and independent 
of the Universe as now visible to us — '' eternal ** principles 
as they are called. Those, however, who recall the doctrine 
set forth in First Principle8,will hesitate to put this interpre- 
tation on the word. Bight, as we can think it, necessitates 
the thought of not-right, or wrong, for its correlative; 
and hence, to ascribe rightness to the acts of the Power 
manifested through phenomena, is to assume the possibility 
that wrong acts may be committed by this Power. But 
how come there to exist, apart from this Power, conditions 
of such kind that subordination of its acts to them makes 
them right and insubordination wrong. How can Uncon- 
ditioned Being be subject to conditions beyond itself ? 

If, for example, any one should assert that the Cause of 
Things, conceived in respect of fundamental moral attributes 
as like ourselves, did right in producing a Universe which, 
in the course of immeasurable time, has given origin to 
beings capable of pleasure, and would have done wrong in 
abstaining from the production of such a Universe; then, 
the comment to be made is that, imposing the moral ideas

generated in his finite consciousness, upon the Infinite 
Existence which transcends consciousness^ he goes behind 
that Infinite Existence and prescribes for it principles of 
action. 

As implied in foregoing chapters^ right and wrong as 
conceived by us can exist only in relation to the actions of 
creatures capable of pleasures and pains ; seeing that analysis 
carries us back to pleasures and pains as the elements out 
of which the conceptions are framed. 

But if the word ''absolute^'' as used abovCi does not 
refer to the Unconditioned Being— if the principles of 
action distinguished as absolute and relative concern the 
conduct of conditioned beings ; in what way are the words 
to be understood ? An explanation of their meanings will 
be best conveyed by a criticism on the current conceptions 
of right and wrong. 

§ 100. Conversations about the affairs of liEe habitually 
imply the belief that every deed named may be placed 
under the one head or the other. In discussing a political 
question^ both sides take it for granted that some line of 
action may be chosen which is rights while all other lines of 
action are wrong. So, too, is it with judgments on the 
doings of individuals : each of these is approved or disap- 
proved on the assumption that it is definitely classable as 
good or bad. Even where qualifications are admitted, they 
ure admitted with an implied idea that some such positive 
characterization is to be made. 

Nor is it in popular thought and speech only that we see 
this. If not wholly and definitely yet partially and by 
implication, the belief is expressed by moralists. In his 
Meihods of Ethics (1st Ed. p. 6.) Mr. Sidgwick says :— 
" That there is in any given circumstances some one thing 
which ought to be done and that this can be known, is a 
fundamental assumption, made not by philosophers only, 
but by all men who perform any processes of moral reason* 

17*

260 THE DATA OF BTHICS. 

ing.''* In this sentence there is specifically asserted only 
the last of the above propositions ; namely, that, in every 
case, what '^ ought to be done " '' can be known/' But 
though that ''which ought to be done'* is not distinctly 
identified with ''the right/' it may bo inferred, in the 
absence of any indication to the contrary, that Mr. Sidgwick 
regards the two as identical ; and. doubtless, in so conceiving 
the postulates of moral science, he is at one with most, k 
not all, who have made it a subject of study. At first sight, 
indeed, nothing seems more obvious than that if actions are 
to be judged at all, these postulates must be accepted. 
Nevertheless they may both be called in question, and I 
think it may be shown that neither of them is tenable. 
Instead of admitting that there is in every case a right and 
a wrpng, it may be contended that in multitudinous cases 
no ri^ht, properly so-called, can be alleged, but only a least 
wrong ; and further, it may be contended that in many of 
these cases where there can be alleged only a least wrong, 
1 it is not possible to ascertain with any precision which is 
the least wrong. 

A great part of the perplexities in ethical speculation 
arise from neglect of this distinction between right and 
least wrong — ^between the absolutely right and the relatively 
right. And many further perplexities .are due to the 
assumption that it can, in some way, be decided in every 
case which of two courses is morally obligatory. 

§ 101. The law of absolute right can take no cognizance of 
pain, save the cognizance implied by negation. Pain is the 
correlative of some species of wrong — some kind of diver- 
gence from that course of action which perfectly fulfils all 
requirements. If, as was shown in an early chapter, the 

* I do not find this passage in the second edition ; but the omission of 
it appears to have arisen not fvom any change of Tiew, but because it did 
not natnralljr come into the re-cast form of the aignment which the section 
contains.

ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE ETHICS. 261 

conception of good conduct always proves, when analyzed, 
to be the conception of a conduct which produces a surplus 
of pleasure somewhere; while, conversely, the conduct 
conceived as bad proves always to be that which inflicts 
somewhere a surplus of either positive or negative pain; 
then the absolutely good, the absolutely right, in conduct, 
can be that only which produces pure pleasure — ^pleasure 
unalloyed with pain anywhere. By implication, conduct 
which has any concomitant of pain, or any painful conse- 
quence, is partially wrong; and the highest claim to be 
made for such conduct is, that it is the least wrong which, 
under the conditions, is possible — ^the relatively right. 
The contents of preceding chapters imply throughout 
\ that, considered from the evolution point of view, the acts 
of men during the transition which has been, is still, and 
'■ long will be, in progress, must, in most cases, be of the 
' kind here classed as least wrong. In proportion to the 
I incongruity between the natures men inherit from the 
i pre-social state, and the requirements of social life, must 
; be the amount of pain entailed by their actions, either on 
I themselves or on others. In so far as pain is suffered, evil is 
, inflicted; and conduct which inflicts any evil cannot be 
absolutely good* 

To make clear the distinction here insisted upon between 
that perfect conduct which is the subject-matter of Absolute 
Ethics, and that imperfect conduct which is the subject- 
matter of Belative Ethics, some illustrations must be given. 

§ 102. Among the best examples of absolutely right 
actions to be named, are those arising where the nature and 
the requirements have been moulded to one another before 
social evolution began. Two will here suflBice. 

Consider the relation of a healthy mother to a healthy 
infant. Between the two there exists a mutual dependence 
which is a source of pleasure to both. In yielding its natural 
food to the child, the mother receives gratification; and to

262 THE DATA OY BTHIC8. 

the child there comes the satisfaction of appetite— a satis- 
faction which accompanies furtheraxice of hf e, growth^ and in* 
creasing enjoyment. Let the relation be suspended^ and on 
both sides there is suffering. The mother experiences both 
bodily pain and mental pain; and the painful sensation 
borne by the child, brings as its results physical mischief 
and some damage to the emotional nature. Thus the 
act is one that is to both exclusively pleasurable, while 
abstention entails pain on both ; and it is consequently of 
the kind we here call absolutely right. In the 

parental relations of the father we are furnished with a 
kindred example. If he is well constituted in body and 
mind, his boy, eager for play, finds in him a sympathetic 
response ; and their frolics, giving mutual pleasure, not only 
further the child^s physical welfare but strengthen that bond 
of good feeling between the two which makes subsequent 
I guidance easier. And then if, repudiating the stupidities 

.^^j^ of early education as at present conceived and unhappily 

State-enacted, he has rational ideas of mental development, 

' ^/^ and sees that the second-hand knowledge gained through 
books should begin to supplement the first-hand knowledge 

^ "^'^ gained by direct observation, only when a good stock of this 

has been acquired, he will, with active sympathy, aid in 
that exploration of the surrounding world which his boy 
pursues with delight ; giving and receiving gratification from 
moment to moment while furthering ultimate welfare. 
Here, again, are actions of a kind purely pleasurable alike 
in their immediate and remote effects — actions absolutely 
' right. 

The intercourse of adults yields, for the reason assigned, 
relatively few cases that fall completely within the same 
category. In their transactions from hour to hour, more 
or less of deduction from pure gratification is caused on one 
or other side by imperfect fitness to the requirements. The 
pleasures men gain by labouring in their vocations and 
receiving in one form or other returns for their services.

ABSOLUTS AND BBLATIVB ETHICS. 268 

nsoally have the drawback that the labours, are in a con- 
siderable degree displeasurable. Cases^ however^ do occur 
where the energies are so abundant that inaction is irksome ; 
and where the daily work^ not too great in duration, is of a 
kind appropriate to the nature ; and where, as a consequence, 
pleasure rather than pain is a concomitant. When services 
yielded by such a one are paid for by another similarly 
adapted to his occupation, the entire transaction is of the 
kind we are here considering : exchange under agreement 
between two so constituted, becomes a means of pleasure to 
both, with no set-off of pain. Bearing in mind the form of 
nature which social discipline is producing, as shown in the 
contrast between savage and civiUzed, the implication is that 
ultimately men's activities at large will assume this character. 
Remembering that in the course of organic evolution, the 
means to enjoyment themselves eventually become sources 
of enjoyment ; and that there is no form of action which 
may not through the development of appropriate structures 
become pleasurable ; the inference must be that industrial 
activities carried on through voluntary co-operation, will in 
time acquire the character of absolute rightuess as here 
conceived. Already, indeed, something like such a state has 
been reached among certain of those who minister to our 
SBsthetic gratifications. The artist of genius — ^poet, painter, 
or musician — ^is one who obtains the means of living by acts 
that are directly pleasurable to him, while they yield, 
immediately or remotely, pleasures to others. Once 

more, among absolutely right acts may be named certain of 
those which we class as benevolent. I say certain of them, 
because such benevolent acts as entail submission to pain, 
positive or negative, that others may receive pleasure, are, 
by the definition, excluded. But there are benevolent acts

abont to alight at the wrong station^ and^ warned against 
doing so, is saved irom evil : each being, as a consequence^ 
gratified. There is a misunderstanding between friends, 
and one who sees how it has arisen, explains : the result 
being agreeable to all. Services to those around in the 
small affairs of life, may be, and often are, of a kind which 
there is equal pleasure in giving and receiving. Indeed, 
as was urged in the last chapter, the actions of developed 
altruism must habitually have this character. And so, in 
countless ways suggested by these few, men may add to 
one anothers happiness without anywhere producing un- 
happiness — ^ways which are therefore absolutely right. 

In contrast with these consider the many actions which 
from hour to hour are gone through, now with an accompani- 
ment of some pain to the actor and now bringing results 
that are partially painful to others, but which nevertheless 
are imperative. As implied by antithesis with cases above 
referred to, the wearisomeness of productive labour as 
ordinarily pursued, renders it in so far wrong; but then 
far greater suffering would result, both to the labourer and 
his family, and therefore far greater wrong would be done, 
were this wearisomeness not borne. Though the pains 
which the care of many children entail on a mother, form 
a considerable set-off from the pleasures secured by them 
to her children and herself; yet the miseries, immediate and 
remote, which neglect would entail so far exceed them, that 
submission to such pains up to the limit of physical ability 
to bear them, becomes morally imperative as being the least 
wrong. A servant who fails to fulfil an agreement in respect 
of work, or who is perpetually breaking crockery, or who 
pilfers, may have to suffer pain from being discharged ; but 
since the evils to be borne by all concerned if incapacity or 
misconduct is tolerated^ not in one case only but habitually, 
must be much greater, such infliction of pain is warranted 
as a means to preventing greater pain. Withdrawal of

wlose commodities are inferior, or who gives short measure, 
or who is unpunctual, decreases his welfare, and perhaps 
injures his belongings ; but as saving him from these evils 
would imply bearing the evils his conduct causes, and as 
snch^regard for his well-being would imply disregard of the 
well-being of some more worthy or more efficient tradesman 
to whom the custom would else go, and as, chiefly, general 
adoption of the implied course, having the effect that the 
inferior would not suffer from their inferiority nor the 
superior gain by their superiority, would produce universal 
misery, withdrawal is justified — the act is relatively right. 

§ 103. I pass now to the second of the two propositions i 
above enunciated. After recognizing the truth that a large \ 
part of human conduct is not absolutely right, but only 
relatively right, we have to recognize the further truth that 
in many cases where there is no absolutely right course, 
but only courses that are more or less wrong, it is not 
possible to say which is the least wrong. Recurrence to the 
instances just given will show this. 

There is a point up to which itr is relatively right for a 
parent to carry self-sacrifice for the benefit of offspring; 
and there is a point beyond which self-sacrifice cannot be 
pushed without bringing, not only on himself or herself but 
also on the family, evils greater than those to be prevented 
by the self-sacrifice. Who shall say where this point is f 
Depending on the constitutions and needs of those con- 
cerned, it is in no two cases the same, and cannot be by 
anyone more than guessed. The transgressions or short- 
comings of a servant vary from the trivial to the grave, and 
the evils which discharge may bring range through countless 
degrees from slight to serious. The penalty may be in- 
flicted for a very small offence, and then there is wrong 
done; or after numerous grave offences it may not be 
inflicted, and again there is wrong done. How shall be 
determined the degree of transgression beyond which to

discharge is less wrong tlian not to discharge? In like 
manner with the shopkeeper's misdemeanonrs. No one can 
snm np either the amount of positive and negative pain 
which tolerating them involves, nor the amount of positive 
and negative pain involved by not tolerating them; and 
in medium cases no one can say where the one exceeds the 
other. 

In men's wider relations frequently occur circumstances 
under which a decision one or other way is imperative, and 
yet under which not even the most sensitive conscience 
helped by the clearest judgment, can decide which of 
the alternatives is relatively right. Two examples' will 
suffice. Here is a merchant who loses by the failure 

of a man indebted to him. Unless he gets help he himself 
will fail ; and if he fails he will bring disaster not only on 
his family but on all who have given him credit. Even if 
by borrowing he is enabled to meet immediate engagements, 
he is not safe; for the time is one of panic, and others 
of his debtors by going to the wall may put him in farther 
difficulties. Shall he ask a friend for a loan ? On the one 
hand, is it not wrong forthwith to bring on himself, his 
family, and those who have business relations with him, the 
evils of his failure ? On the other hand, is it not wrong to 
hypothecate the property of his friend, and lead him too, 
with his belongings and dependents, into similar risks? 
The loan would probably tide him over his difficulty; in 
which case would it not be unjust to his creditors did he 
refrain from asking it ? Contrariwise, the loan would very 
possibly fail to stave off his bankruptcy ; in which case is 
not his action in trying to obtain it, practically fraudulent ? 
Though in extreme cases it may be easy to say which course 
is the least wrong, how is it possible in all those medium 
cases where even by the keenest man of business the con- 
tingencies cannot be calculated ? Take, again, the 
difficulties that not unfrequently arise from antagonism 
between family duties and social duties. Here is a tenant

fanner whose political principles prompt him to vote in 
opposition to hig; landlord. If, being a Liberal, he votes for 
a Conservative^ not only does he by his act say that he 
thinks what he does not think, but he may perhaps assist 
what he regards as bad legislation : his vote may by chance 
turn the election, and on a Parliamentary division a single 
member may decide the fate of a measure. Even neglecting, 
as too improbable, such serious consequences, there is the 
manifest truth that if all who hold like views with himself, 
are similarly deterred from electoral expression of them, 
there must result a different balance of power and a different 
national policy : making it clear that only by adherence of 
all to their political principles, can the policy he thinks right 
be maintained. But now, on the other hand, how can he 
absolve himself from responsibility for the evils which those 
depending on him may suffer if he fulfils what appears to 
be a peremptory public duty? Is not his duty to his 
children even more peremptory? Does not the family 
precede the State ; and does not the welfare of the State 
depend on the welfare of the family ? May he, then, take a 
course which, if the threats uttered are carried out, will eject 
him from his farm; and so cause inability , perhaps temporary 
perhaps prolonged, to feed his children. The contingent 
evils are infinitely varied in their ratios. In one case the 
imperativeness of the public duty is great and the evil that 
may come on dependents small ; in another case the political 
issue is of trivial moment and the possible injury which the 
family may suffer is great; and between these extreme?* 
there are all gradations. Further, the degrees of probability 
of each result, public and private, range from the nearly 
certain to the almost impossible. Admitting, then, that it is 
wrong to act in a way likely to injure the State ; and admit- 
ting that it is wrong to act in a way likely to injure the 
family; we have to recognize the fact that in countless cases 
no one can decide by which of the alternative courses the 
least wrong is likely to be done.

These instances will sufficiently show that in conduct at 
large^ including men's dealings with themselves^ with their 
families,, with their friends, with their debtors and creditors, 
and with the public, it usually happens that whatever course 
is. taken entails some pain somewhere ; forming a deduction 
from the pleasure achieved, and making the course in so 
far not absolutely right. Further, they will show that 
throughout a considerable part of conduct, no guiding 
principle, no method of estimation, enables us to say 
whether a proposed course is even relatively right; as 
causing, proximately and remotely, specially and generally, 
the greatest surplus of good over eviL 

§ 104. And now we are prepared for dealing in a syste- 
matic way with the distinction between Absolute Ethics 
and Belative Ethics. 

Scientific truths, of whatever order, are reached by 
eliminating perturbing or conflicting factors, and recog- 
nizing only fundamental factors. When, by dealing with 
fundamental factors in the abstract, not as presented in 
actual phenomena but as presented in ideal separation, 
general laws have been ascertained, it becomes possible to 
draw inferences in concrete cases by taking into account 
incidental factors. But it is only by first ignoring these 
and recognizing the essential elements alone, that we can 
discover the essential truths sought. Take, in illustration, 
the progress of mechanics from its empirical form to its 
rational form. 

All have occasional experience of the fact that a person 
pushed on one side beyond a certain degree, loses his 
balance and falls. It is observed that a stone flung or 
an arrow shot, does not proceed in a straight line, but 
comes to the earth after pursuing a course which deviates 
more and more from its original course. When trying to 
break a stick across the knee, it is found that success is 
easier if the stick is seized at considerable distances from

the knee on each side tlian if seized close to the knee. 
Daily use of a spear draws attention to the truth that by 
thrusting its point under a stone and depressing the shafts 
. the stone may be raised the more readily the further away 
the hand is towards the end. Here, then, are sundry expe- 
riences, eventually grouped into empirical generalizations, 
which serve to guide conduct in certain simple cases. How 
does mechanical science evolve from these experiences ? 
To reach a formula expressing the powers of the lever, it 
supposes a lever which does not, like the stick, admit of 
being bent, but is absolutely rigid ; and it supposes a fulcrum 
not having a broad surface, like that of one ordinarily used, 
but a fulcrum without breath; and it supposes that the 
weight to be raised bears on a definite point, instead of 
bearing over a considerable portion of the lever. Similarly 
with the leaning body, which, passing a certain inclination, 
overbalances. Before the truth respecting the relations of 
centre of gravity and base can be formulated, it must be 
assumed that the surface on which the body standi is un- 
yielding ; that the edge of the body itself is unyielding ; 
and that its mass, while made to lean more and more, does 
not change its form — conditions not fulfilled in the cases 
commonly observed. And so, too, is it with the projectile : 
determination of its course by deduction from mechanical 
laws, primarily ignores all deviations caused by its shape 
and by the resistance of the air. The science of rational 
mechanics is a science which consists of such ideal truths, 
and can come into existence only by thus dealing with ideal 
cases. It remains impossible so long as attention is restricted 
to concrete cases presenting all the complications of friction, 
plasticity, and so forth. But now, after disen- 

tangling certain fundamental mechanical truths, it becomes 
possible by their help to guide actions better; and it becomes 
possible to guide them still better when, as presently happens, 
the complicating elements from which they have been 
disentangled are themselves taken into account. At an

advanced stage^ the modifying effects of friction are allowed 
for, and the inferences are qualified to the requisite extent. 
The theory of the pulley is corrected in its application to 
actual cases by recognizing the rigidity of cordage; the 
effects of which are formulated. The stabilities of masses, 
determinable in the abstract by reference to the centres of 
gravity of the masses in relation to the bases, come to be 
determined in the concrete by including also their characters 
in respect of cohesion. The courses of projectiles having 
been theoretically settled as though they moved through a 
vacuum, are afterwards settled in more exact correspon- 
dence with &ct by taking into account atmospheric 
resistance. And thus we see illustrated the 

relation between certain absolute truths of mechanical 
science, and certain relative truths which involve them. 
We are shown that no scientific establishment of relative 
truths is possible, until the absolute truths have been f ormu« 
lated independently. We see that mechanical science fitted 
for dealing with the real, can arise only after ideal mechanical 
science has arisen. 

All this holds of moral science. As by early and rude 
experiences there were inductively reached, vague but par- 
tially-true notions respecting the overbalancing of bodies, the 
motions of missiles, the actions of levers ; so by early and rude 
experiences there were inductively reached, vague but par- 
tially-true notions respecting the effects of men's behaviour 
on themselves, on one another, and on society : to a certain 
extent serving in the last case, as in the first, for the guidance 
of conduct. Moreover, as this rudimentary mechanical 
knowledge, though still remaining empirical, becomes during 
early stages of civilization at once more definite and more 
extensive ; so. during early stages of civilization these ethical 
ideas, still retaining their empirical character, increase in 
precision and multiplicity. But just as we have seen that 
mechanical knowledge of the empirical sort can evolve into 
mechanical science, only by first omitting all qualifying

circnmstancesj and generalizing in absolute ways the funda- 
mental laws of forces ; so here we have to see that empiri- 
cal ethics can evolve into rational ethics only by first 
neglecting all complicating incidents^ and formulating the 
laws of right action apart from the obscuring effects of 
special conditions. And the final implication is that just 
as the system of mechanical truths^ conceived in ideal 
separation as absolute, becomes applicable to real mechanical 
problems in such way that making allowance for all inci- 
dental circumstances there can be reached conclusions far 
nearer to the truth than could otherwise be reached ; so, a 
system of ideal ethical truths, expressing the absolutely 
right, will be applicable to the questions of our transitional 
state in such ways that, allowing for the friction of an 
incomplete life and the imperfection of existing natures, 
we may ascertain with approximate correctness what is the 
relatively right. 

§ 105. In a chapter entitled '' Definition of Morality " in 
Social Statics, I contended that the moral law, properly so- 
called, is the law of the perfect man — ^is the fonnula of ideal 
conduct — is the statement in all cases of that which should 
be, and cannot recognize in its propositions any elements 
implying existence of that which should not be. Instancing 
questions concerning the right course to be taken in cases 
where wrong has abeady been done, I alleged that the 
answers to such questions cannot be given ''on purely 
ethical principles.'^ I argued that — 

" No conclusions can lay claim to absolate tnith, bnt snch as depend upon 
tmths that are themselTes absolnte. Before there can be exactness in an 
inference, there must be exactness in the antecedent propositions. A geo^ 
metrician requires that the straight lines with which he deals shall be veritably 
straight ; and that his circles, and ellipses, and parabolas shall agree with 
precise definitions — shall perfectly and invariably answer to specified equations. 
If yon put to him a question in which these conditions are not complied with, 
he tells you that it cannot be answered. So likewise is it with the philosophical 
moralist. He treats solely of the straight man. He determines the propertiefl 
of the straight man ; describes how the straight man comports himself $ shows 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



272 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

in what relationship he stands to other straight men ; shows how a commiin!t7 
of straight men is constituted. Any deyiation from strict rectitude he is 
ohliged wholly to ignore. It cannot he admitted into his premises without 
vitiating ail his conclnpions. A prohlem in which a eroolced man forms one of 
the elements is insolnhle hy him.*' 

Beferring to this view^ specifically in the first edition 
of the Methods of Ethics but more generally in the second 
edition^ Mr. Sidgwick says :— 

<* Those who take this yiew adduce the analogy of Greometry to show 
that Ethics ought to deal with ideally perfect human relations, just as 
Geometry treats of ideally perfect lines and circles. But the most irregular 
line has definite spatial relations with which Geometry does not refuse to 
deal : though of course they are more complex than those of a straight 
line. So in Astronomy, it would he more conyenient for purposes of study if 
the stars moyed in circles, as was once helieyed : but the fact that they moye 
not in circles but in ellipses, and eyen in imperfect and perturbed ellipses, does 
not take them out of the sphere of scientific inyestigation : by patience and 
industry we haye learnt how to reduce to principles and calculate eyen these 
more complicated motions. It is, no doubt, a conyenient artifice for purposes 
of instruction to assume that the planets moye in perfect ellipses (or eyen — at 
an earlier stage of study — ^in circles) : we thus allow the indiyidual*s knowledge 
to pass through the same gradations in accuracy as that of the race has done. 
But what we want, as astronomers, to know is the actual motion of the 
htars iind its causes : and similarly as moralists we naturally inquire what 
ought to be done in the actual world in which we liye.*' P. 19, Sec. £d. 

Beginning with the first of these two statements, which 
concerns Geometry, I must confess myself surprised to find 
my propositions called in question; and after full con- 
sideration I remain at a loss to understand Mr. Sidgwick's 
mode of viewing the matter. When, in a sentence pre- 
ceding those quoted above, I remarked on the impossibility 
of solving ^^ mathematically a series of problems respecting 
crooked lines and broken-backed curves,'' it never occurred 
to me that I should be met by the direct assertion that 
•'•Geometry does not refuse to deal'' with ^'the most 
irregular line." Mr. Sidgwick states that an irregular line, 
say such as a child makes in scribbling, has ^^ definite 
spatial relations." What meaning does he here give 
to the word *^ definite." If he means that its relations 
to space at large are definite in the sense that by an 
infinite intelligence they would be definable; the reply 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



ABSOLUTE AND EELATIVE ETHICS. 273 

is that to an infinite intelligence all spatial relations would 
be definable : there could be no indefinite spatial relations — 
the word '^ definite " thus ceasing to mark any distinction. 
If, on the other hand, when saying that an irregular line has 
'^definite spatial relations/' he means relations knowable 
definitely by human intelligence; there still comes the 
question, how is the word ^^ definite '' to be understood ? 
Surely anything distinguished as definite admits of being 
defined ; but how can we define an irregular line ? And 
if we cannot define the irregular line itself, how can 
WQ know its '' spatial relations '' definitely ? And how, in 
the absence of definition, can Geometry deal with it ? If 
Mr. Sidgwick means that it can be dealt with by the '^method 
of limits,^' then the reply is that in such case, not the line 
itself is dealt with geometrically, but certain definite lines 
artificially put in quasi-definite relations to it : the indefinite 
becomes cognizable only through the medium of the hypo- 
thetically-definite. 

Turning to the second illustration, the rejoinder to be 
made is that in so far as it concerns the relations between 
the ideal and the real, the analogy drawn does not shake 
but strengthens my argument. For whether considered 
under its geometrical or under its dynamical aspect, and 
whether considered in the necessary order of its develop- 
ment OP in the order historically displayed. Astronomy 
shows us throughout, that truths respecting simple, theo- 
retically-exact relations, must be ascertained before truths 
respecting the complex and practically-inexact relations 
that actually exist, can be ascertained. As applied to the 
interpretation of planetary movements, we see that the 
theory of cycles and epicycles was based on pre-existing 
knowledge of the circle : the properties of an ideal curve 
having been learnt, a power was acquired of giving some 
expression to the celestial motions. We see that the 
Oopernican interpretation expressed the facts in terms of 
circular movements otherwise distributed and combined. 

18

274 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

We see that Kepler's advance from the conception of circular 
movements to the conception of elliptic movements, was 
made possible by comparing the facts as they are with the 
facts as they would be were the movements circular. We see 
that the subsequently-learnt deviations from elliptic move- 
ments, were learnt only through the pre-supposition that the 
movements are elliptical. And we see, lastly, that even now 
predictions concerning the exact positions of planets, after 
taking account of perturbations, imply constant references to 
ellipses that are regarded as their normal or average orbits 
for the time being. Thus, ascertainment of the actual truths 
has been made possible only by pre-ascertainment of certain 
ideal truths. To be convinced that by no other course could 
the actual truths have been ascertained, it needs only to 
suppose any one saying that it iiid not concern him, as an 
astronomer, to know anything about the properties of 
circles and ellipses, but that he had to deal with the Solar 
System as it exists, to which end it was his business to 
observe and tabulate positions and directions and to be 
guided by the facts as he found them. So, too, 

is it if we look at the development of dynamical astronomy. 
The first proposition in Newton's Prindpia deals with the 
movement of a single body round a single centre of force ; 
and the phenomena of central motion are first formulated 
in a case which is not simply ideal, but in which there is no 
specification of the force concerned : detachment from the 
real is the greatest possible. Again, postulating a 
principle of action conforming to an ideal law, the theory 
of gravitation deals with the several problems of the Solar 
System in fictitious detachment from the rest; and it makes 
certain fictitious assumptions, such as that the mass of each 
body concerned is concentrated in its centre of gravity. 
Only later, after establishing the leading truths by this 
artifice of disentangling the major factors from the minor 
factors, is the theory applied to the actual problems in their 
ascending degrees of complexity ; taking in more and more 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE ETHICS. 275 

of the minor factors. And if we ask whether the dynamics 
of the Solar System could have been established in any 
other way, we see that here, too, simple truths holding under 
ideal conditions, have to be ascertained before real truths 
existing under complex conditions can be ascertained. 

The alleged necessary precedence of Absolute Ethics over 
Relative Ethics is thus, I think, further elucidated. One 
who has followed the general argument thus far, will not 
deny that an ideal social being may be conceived as so con- 
stituted that his spontaneous activities are congruous with 
the conditions imposed by the social environment formed by 
other such beings. In many places, and in various ways, 
I have argued that conformably with the laws of evolution 
in general, and conformably with the laws of organization in 
particular, there has been, and is, in progress, an adaptation 
of humanity to the social state, changing it in the direction 
of such an ideal congruity. And the corollary before drawn 
and here repeated, is that the ultimate man is one in whom I 
this process has gone so far as to produce a correspondence j 
between all the promptings of his nature and all the require- 
ments of his life as carried on in society.. If so, it is a 
necessary implication that there exists an ideal code of 
conduct formulating the behaviour of the completely adapted 
man in the completely evolved society. Such a code is that 
here called Absolute Ethics as distinguished from Relative 
Ethics — ^a code the injunctions of which are alone to be 
considered as absolutely right in contrast with those that are 
relatively right or least wrong; and which, as a system of. 
ideal conduct, is to serve as a standard for our guidance in 
solving, as well as we can, the problems of real conduct. 

§ 105. A clear conception of this matter is so important 
that I must be excused for bringing in aid of it a further 
illustration, more obviously appropriate as being furnished 
by organic science instead of by inorganic science. The 
relation between morality proper and morality as commonly

276 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

conceiyed, is analogous to the relation between physiology 
and pathology ; and the course usually pursued by moralists 
is much like the course of one who studies pathology with, 
out previous study of physiology. 

Physiology describes the various functions which, as com- 
binedj constitute and maintain life ; and iu treating of them 
it assumes that they are severally performed in right ways, 
in due amounts, and in proper order : it recognizes only 
healthy functions. If it explains digestion, it supposes that 
the heart is supplying blood and that the visceral nervous 
system is stimulating the organs immediately concerned. 
If it gives a theory of the circulation, it assumes that blood 
has been produced by the combined actions of the structures 
devoted to its production, and that it is properly aerated. 
If the relations between respiration and the vital processes 
at large are interpreted, it is on the pre-supposition that the 
heart goes on sending blood, not only to the lungs and to 
certain nervous centres, but to the diaphragm and intercostal 
muscles. Physiology ignores failures in the actions of 
these several organs. It takes no account of imperfec- 
tions, it neglects derangements, it does not recognize pain,' 
it knows nothing of vital wrong. It simply formulates that 
which goes on as a result of complete adaptation of all parts 
to all needs. That is to say, in relation to the inner actions 
constituting bodily life, physiological theory has a position 
like that which ethical theory, under its absolute form as 
above conceived, has to the outer actions constituting con- 
duct. The moment cognizance is taken of excess of function, 
or arrest of function, or defect of function, with the resulting 
evil, physiology passes into pathology. We begin now to 
take account of wrong actions in the inner life analogous to 
the wrong actions in the outer life taken account of by 
ordinary theories of morals. 

The antithesis thus drawn, however, is but preliminary. 
After observing the fact that there is a science of vital 
actions normally carried on, which ignores abnormal actions ; 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



A.BSOLUTE AND RELATIVE ETHICS. 277 

we have more especially to observe that the science of 
abnormal actions can reach such definiteness as is possible 
to it, only on condition that the science of normal actions 
has previously become definite ; or rather, let us say that 
pathological science depends for its advances on previous 
advances made by physiological science. The very con- 
ception of disordered action implies a pre-conception of 
well-ordered action. Before it can be decided that the heart \ 
is beating faster or slower than it should, its healthy rate 
of beating must be learnt ; before the pulse can be recog- 
nized as too weak or too strong, its proper strength must 
be known; and so throughout. Even the rudest and most 
empirical ideas of diseases, pre-suppose ideas of the healthy 
states from which they are deviations ; and obviously the 
diagnosis of diseases can become scientific, only as fast as 
there arises scientific knowledge of organic actions that are 
undiseased. 

Similarly, then, is it with the relation between absolute 
morality, or the law of perfect right in human conduct, and 
relative morality which, recognizing wrong in human con- 
duct, has to decide in what way the wrong deviates from the 
right, and how the right is to be most nearly approached. 
When, formulating normal conduct in an ideal society, we 
have reached a science of absolute ethics, we have simul- 
taneously reached a science which, when used to interpret 
the phenomena of real societies in their transitional states, 
full of the miseries due to non-adaptation (which we may call 
pathological states) enables us to form approximately true 
conclusions respecting the natures of the abnormalities, and 
the courses which tend most in the direction of the normal. 

§ 106. And now let it be observed that the conception of 
ethics thus set forth, strange as many will think it, is one 
which really lies latent in the beliefs of moralists at large. 
Though not definitely acknowledged ib is vaguely implied 
in many of their propositions.

From early times downwards we find in etiucal specula- 
tions^ references to the ideal man^ his acts^ his feelings^ his 
judgments. Well-doing is conceived by Sokrates as the 
doing of '' the best man,'* who " as a husbandman, performs 
well the duties of husbandry ; as a surgeon, the duties of 
the medical art; in political life, his duty towards the 
commonwealth/' Plato, in Minos, as a standard to which 
State-law should conform, "postulates the decision of some 
ideal wise man ;" and in Laches the wise man's knowledge 
of good and evil is supposed to furnish the standard: 
disregarding ^'the maxims of the existing society'' as un- 
scientific, Plato regards as the proper guide, that " Idea of 
the Good which only a philosopher can ascend to." Aristotle 
{Eth. Bk. iii. ch. 4), making the decisions of the good man 
the standard, says : — " For the good man judges everything 
rightly, and in every case the truth appears so to him. 
.... And perhaps the principal difference between the 
good and the bad man is that the good man sees the truth 
in every case, since he is, as it were, the rule and measure 
of it." The Stoics, too, conceived of " complete rectitude of 
action" as that *' which none could achieve except the wise 
man"— the ideal man. And Epicurus had an ideal standard. 
He held the virtuous state to be " a tranquil, undisturbed, 
innocuous, non-competitive fruition, which approached 
most nearly to the perfect happiness of the Gods," who 
" neither suffered vexation in themselves nor caused vexa- 
tion to others."* 

If in modem times, influenced by theological dogmas 
concerning the Ml and human sinfulness, and by a theory 
of obligation derived from the current creed, moralists 
have less frequently referred to an ideal, yet references 
are traceable. We see one in the dictum of Kant—'' Act 
according to that maxim only, which you can wish, at the 
same time, to become a universal law." For this implies

the thought of a society in which the maxim is acted upon 
by all and universal benefit recognized as the effect : there 
is a conception of ideal conduct under ideal conditions. And 
though Mr. Sidgwick, in the quotation above made from 
him, implies that Ethics is concerned with man as he is, 
rather than with man as he should be; yet, in elsewhere 
speaking of Ethics as dealing with conduct as it should be, 
rather than with conduct as it is, he postulates ideal conduct 
and indirectly the ideal man. On his first page, speaking 
of Ethics along with Jurisprudence and Politics, he says 
that they are distinguished '^by the characteristic that they 
attempt to determine not the actual but the ideal — what 
ought to exist, not what does exist.'' 

It requires only that these various conceptions of an ideal 
conduct and of an ideal humanity, should be made consistent 
and definite, to bring them into agreement with the concep- 
tion above set forth. At present such conceptions are 
habitually vague. The ideal man having been conceived in 
terms of the current morality, is thereupon erected into a 
moral standard by which the goodness of actions may be 
judged ; and the reasoning becomes circular. To mslke the 
ideal man serve as a standard, he has to be defined in 
terms of the conditions which his nature fulfils— in terms of 
those objective requirements which must be met before 
conduct can be right ; and the common defect of these con- 
ceptions of the ideal man, is that they suppose him out of 
relation to such conditions. 

All the above references to him, direct or indirect, 
imply that the ideal man is supposed to live and act under 
existing social conditions. The tacit inquiry is, not what 
his actions would be under circumstances altogether changed, 
but what they would be under present circumstances. And 
this inquiry is futile for two reasons. The co-existence of a 
perfect man and an imperfect society is impossible; and 
could the two co-exist, the resulting conduct would not 
furnish the ethical standard sought. In the

first place^ given the laws of life as they are^ and a man of 
ideal nature cannot be produced in a society consisting of 
men having natures remote from the ideal. As well might 
we expect a child of English type to be bom among Negroes^ 
as expect that among the organically immoral^ one who is 
organically moral will arise. Unless it be denied that 
character results from inherited structure, it must be admitted 
that since, in any society, each individual descends from a 
stock which, traced back a few generations, ramifies every- 
where through the society, and participates in its average 
nature, there must, notwithstanding marked individual 
diversities, be preserved such community as prevents any- 
one from reaching an ideal form while the rest remain far 
below it. In the second place, ideal conduct 

such as ethical theory is concerned with, is not possible for 
the ideal man in the midst of men otherwise constituted. 
An absolutely just or perfectly sympathetic person, could not 
live and act according to his nature in a tribe of cannibals. 
Among people who are treacherous and utterly without 
scruple, entire truthfulness and openness must bring ruin. 
If aU around recognize only the law of the strongest, one 
whose nature will not allow him to inflict pain on others, 
must go to the wall. There requires a certain congruity 
between the conduct of each member of a society and other's 
conduct. A mode of action entirely alien to the prevaLLing 
modes of action, cannot be successfully persisted in— must 
eventuate in death of self, or posterity, or both. 

Hence it is manifest that we must consider the ideal man 
as ^existing in the ideal social state. On the evolution- 
hypothesis, the two presuppose one another ; and only when 
they co-exist, can there exist that ideal conduct which 
Absolute Ethics has to formulate, and whijsh Relative Ethics 
has to take as the standard by which to estimate divergencies 
from right, or degrees of wrong.

CHAPTER XVI. 

THE SCOPE OF ETHICS. 

§ 107. At the outset it was shown that as the conduct 
with which Ethics deals, is a part of conduct at large, 
conduct at large must be understood before this part can 
be understood. After taking a general view of conduct, not 
human only but sub-human, and not only as existing but as 
evolving, we saw that Ethics has for its subject-matter the 
most highly-evolved conduct as displayed by the most 
highly-evolved being, Man — ^is a specification of those traits 
which his conduct assumes on reaching its limit of evolution. 
Conceived thus as comprehending the laws of right living 
at large. Ethics has a wider field than is commonly assigned 
to it. Beyond the conduct commonly approved or repro- 
bated as right or wrong, it includes all conduct which 
furthers or hinders, in either direct or indirect ways, the 
welfare of self or others. 

As foregoing chapters in various places imply, the entire 
field of Ethics includes the two great divisions, personal and 
social. There is a class of actions directed to personal ends, 
which are to be judged in their relations to personal well- 
being, considered apart from the well-being of others: 
though they secondarily affect fellow-men these primarily 
afiect the agent himself, and must be classed as intrinsically 
right or wrong according to their beneficial or detrimental 
effects on him. There are actions of another class which 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



282 THE DATA OF ETHICS. 

affect fellow men immediately and remotely, and which, 
though their results to self are not to be ignored, must be 
judged as good or bad mainly by their results to others. 
Actions of this last class fall into two groups. Those of the 
one group achieve ends in ways that do or do not unduly 
interfere with the pursuit of ends by others — actions which, 
because of this difference, we call respectively unjust or just. 
Those forming the other group are of a kind which influence 
the states of others without directly interfering with the 
relations between their labours and the results, in one way or 
the other — ^actions which we speak of as beneficent or malefi- 
cent. And the conduct which we regard as beneficent is 
itself sub-divisible according as it shows us a self-repression 
to avoid giving pain, or an expenditure of effort to give 
pleasure — ^negative beneficence and positive beneficence. 

Each of these divisions and sub-divisions has to be 
considered first as a part of Absolute Ethics and then 
as a part of Relative Ethics. Having seen what its 
injunctions must be for the ideal man under the implied 
ideal conditions, we shall be prepared to see how such 
injunctions are to be most nearly fulfilled by actual men 
under existing conditions. 

§ 108. For reasons already pointed out, a code of perfect 
personal conduct can never be made definite. Many 
forms of life, diverging from one another in considerable 
degrees, may be so carried on in society as entirely to 
fulfil the conditions to harmonious co-operation. And if 
various types of men adapted to various types of activities, 
may thus lead lives that are severally complete after their 
kinds, no specific statement of the activities universally 
required for personal well-being is possible. 

But though the particular requirements to be fulfilled for 
perfect individual well-being, must vary along with variations 
in the material conditions of each society, certain general 
requirements have to be fulfilled by the individuals of all 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



THE SCOPE OP ETHICS. 285 

societies. An average balance between waste and nutrition 
has universally to be preserved. Normal vitality implies a 
relation between activity and rest falling within moderate 
limits of variation. Continuance of the society depends on 
satisfaction of those primarily-personal needs which result 
in marriage and parenthood. Perfection of individual life 
hence implies certain modes of action which are approximately 
alike in all cases, and which therefore become part of the 
subject-matter of Ethics. 

That it is possible to reduce even this restricted part 
to scientific definiteness, can scarcely be said. But ethical 
requirements may here be to such extent affiliated upon 
physical necessities, as to give them a partially-scientific 
authority. It is clear that between the expenditure of bodily 
substance in vital activities, and the taking in of materials 
from which this substance may be renewed, there is a direct 
relation. It is clear, too, that there is a direct relation 
between the wasting of tissue by efEort, and the need for 
those cessations of effort during which repair may overtake 
waste. Nor is it less clear that between the rate of mortality 
and the rate of multiplication in any society, there is a 
relation such that the last must reach a certain level before 
it can balance the first, and prevent disappearance of the 
society. And it may be inferred that pursuits of other 
leading ends are, in like manner, determined by certain 
natural necessities, and from these derive their ethical 
sanctions. That it will ever be practicable to lay down 
precise rules for private conduct in conformity with such 
requirements, may be doubted. But the function of 
Absolute Ethics in relation to private conduct will have 
been discharged, when it has produced the warrant for 
its requirements as generally expressed; when it has shown 
the imperativeness of obedience to them ; and when it has 
thus [taught the need for deliberately considering whether 
the conduct fulfils them as well as may be. 

Under the ethics of personal conduct considered in

284 THE DATA OF ETHIOS. 

relation to existing conditions, liave to come all questions 
concerning the degree in which immediate personal welfare 
has to be postponed, either to ultimate personal welfare or 
to the welfare of others. As now carried on, life hourly 
sets the claims of present self against the claims of future 
self, and hourly brings individual interests face to face with 
the interests of other individuals, taken singly or as asso- 
ciated. In many of such cases the decisions can be nothing 
more than compromises ; and ethical science, here 
necessarily empirical, can do no more than aid in making 
compromises that are the least objectionable. To arrive at 
the best compromise in any case, implies correct conceptions 
of the alternative results of this or that course. And, 
consequently, in so far as the absolute ethics of individual 
conduct can be made definite, it must help us to decide 
between conflicting personal requirements, and also between 
the needs for asserting self and the needs for subordinating 
self. 

§ 109. From that division of Ethics which deals with the 
right regulation of private conduct, considered apart from 
the effects directly produced on others, we pass now to 
that division of Ethics which, considering exclusively the 
effects of conduct on others, treats of the right regulation 
of it with a view to such effects. 

The first set of regulations coming under this head are 
those concerning what we distinguish as justice. Individual 
life is possible only on condition that each organ is paid for 
its action by an equivalent of blood, while the organism as 
a whole obtains from the environment assimilable matters 
that compensate for its efforts ; and the mutual dependence 
of parts in the social organism, necessitates that, alike for 
its total life and the lives of its units, there similarly shall 
be maintained a due proportion between returns and 
labours : the natural relation between work and welfare 
shall be preserved intact. Justice, which formulates the 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



THE SCOPE OF ETHICS. 285 

range of conduct and limitations to conduct hence arising, 
is at once the most important division of Ethics and the 
division which admits of the greatest definiteness. That 
principle of equivalence which meets us when we seek its 
roots in the laws of individual life, involves the idea of 
measure ; and on passing to social life, the same principle 
introduces us to the conception of equity or equalneas, in the 
relations of citizens to one another : the elements of the 
questions arising are quantitative^ and hence the solutions 
assume a more scientific form. Though, having to recog- 
nize difiterences among individuals due to age, sex, or other 
cause, we cannot regard the members of a society as 
absolutely equal, and therefore cannot deal with problems 
growing out of their relations with that precision which 
absolute equality might make possible ; yet, considering them 
as approximately equal in virtue of their common human 
nature, and dealing with questions of equity on this supposi- 
tion, we may reach conclusions of a sufficiently-definite 
kind. 

This division of Ethics considered under its absolute form, 
has to define the equitable relations among perfect indivi- 
duals who Hmit one another's spheres of action by co-exist- 
ing, and who achieve their ends by co-operation. It has 
to do much more than this. Beyond justice between man 
and man, justice between each man and the aggregate oi 
men has to be dealt with by it. The relations between the 
individual and the State, considered as representing all 
individuals, have to be deduced — an important and a 
relatively-difficult matter. What is the ethical warrant for 
governmental authority ? To what ends may it be legiti- 
mately exercised ? How far may it rightly be carried ? Up 
to what point is the citizen bound to recognize the collective 
decisions of other citizens, and beyond what point may he 
properly refuse to obey them. 

These relations, private and pubhc, considered as main- 
tained under ideal conditions, having been formulated, there 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



286 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

come to be dealt with the analogous relations under real con« 
ditions— absolute justice being the standard^ relative justice 
has to be determined by considering how near an approach 
may^ under present circumstances^ be made to it. As 
already implied in various places^ it is impossible during 
stages of transition which necessitate ever-changing com- 
promises^ to fulfil the dictates of absolute equity; and 
nothing beyond empirical judgments can be formed of the 
extent to which they may be, at any given time, fulfilled* 
While war continues and injustice is done between societies, 
there cannot be anything like complete justice within each 
society. Militant organization no less than militant action, is 
irreconcilable with pure equity ; and the inequity implied by 
it inevitably ramifies throughout all social relations. But 
there is at every stage in social evolution, a certain range of 
variation within which it is possible to approach nearer to, 
or diverge further from, the requirements of absolute equity. 
Hence these requirements have ever to be kept in view that 
relative equity may be ascertained. 

§ 110. Of the two sub-divisions into which beneficence 
falls, the negative and the positive, neither can be specialized. 
Under ideal conditions the first of them has but a nominal 
existence; and the second of them passes largely into a 
transfigured form admitting of but general definition. 

In the conduct of the ideal man among ideal men, that 
self-regulation which has for its motive to avoid giving pain, 
practically disappears. No one having feelings which 
prompt acts that disagreeably affect others, there can exist 
no code of restraints referring to this division of conduct. 

But though negative beneficence is only a nominal part 
of Absolute Ethics, it is an actual and considerable part of 
Eelative Ethics. For while men's natures remain imperfectly 
adapted to social life, there must continue in them impulses 
which, causing in some cases the actions we name unjust, 
cause in other cases the actions we name unkind— unkind

THE SCOPE OF ETHICS, 287 

now in deed and now in word ; and in respect of these 
modes of behaviour which, though not aggressive, give pain, 
there arise numerous and complicated problems. Pain is 
sometimes given to others simply by maintaining an equi* 
table claim; pain is at other times given by refusing a 
request ; and again at other times by maintaining an opinion* 
In these and numerous cases suggested by them, there have 
to be answered the questions whether, to avoid inflicting 
pain, personal feelings should be sacrificed, and how far 
sacrificed. Again, in cases of another class, pain is given 
not by a passive course but by an active course. How far 
shall a person who has misbehaved be grieved by showing 
aversion to him ? Shall one whose action is to be repro- 
bated, have the reprobation expressed to him or shall nothing 
be said ? Is it right to annoy by condemning a prejudice 
which another displays ? These and kindred queries have to 
be answered after taking into account the immediate pain 
given, the possible benefit caused by giving it, and the 
possible evil caused by not giving it. In solving problems 
of this class, the only help Absolute Ethics gives, is by 
enforcing the consideration that inflicting more pain than is 
necessitated by proper self-regard, or by desire for another's 
benefit, or by the maintenance of a general principle, is 
unwarranted. 

Of positive beneficence under its absolute form nothing 
more specific can be said than that it must become co- 
extensive with whatever sphere remains for it; aiding 
to complete the life of each as a recipient of services and to 
exalt the life of each as a renderer of services. As with 
a developed humanity the desire for it by every one will 
so increase, and the sphere for exercise of it so decrease, 
as to involve an altruistic competition, analogous to the 
existing egoistic competition, it may be that Absolute Ethics 
wiU eventually include what we before called a higher equity, 
prescribing the mutual limitations of altruistic activities. 

Under its relative form, positive beneficence presents nume-

288 THE DATA OP ETHICS. 

pons problems, alike important, and difficult, admitting only 
of empirical solutions. How far is self-sacrifice for another^s 
benefit to be carried in each case ? — a question which must 
be answered diflferently according to the character of the 
other, the needs of the other, and the various claims of self 
and belongings which have to be met. To what extent 
under given circumstances shall private welfare be sub- 
ordinated to public welfare ? — a question to be answered 
after considering the importance of the end and the 
seriousness of the sacrifice. What benefit and what detri- 
ment will result from gratuitous aid yielded to another ? — 
a question in each case implying an estimate of probabilities 
Is there any unfair treatment of sundry others, involved by 
more than fair treatment of this one other ? Up to what 
limit may help be given to the existing generation of the 
inferior, without entailing mischief on future generations 
of the superior? Evidently to these and many kindred 
questions included in this division of Relative Ethics, 
approximately true answers only can be given. 

But though here Absolute Ethics, by the standard it 
supplies, does not greatly aid Relative Ethics, yet, as in 
other cases, it aids somewhat by keeping before con- 
sciousness an ideal conciliation of the various claims involved; 
and by suggesting the search for such compromise among 
them, as shall not disregard any, but shall satisfy all to the 
greatest extent practicable.

THE CONCILIATION. 



{^While searching for some memoromda, I have discovered the 
rough draft of a chapter belonging to this work. Whether it 
fffas that, when writing out ai length the part of the argument 
it belongs to, I was led to put aside this chapter as having a 
form unfitting it for incorporaiion, or whether it was that I had 
mislaid it, I cannot now remember. The last supposition is, I 
think, the more probable ; since this rough drraft contains mutter 
which, had it been before me, I should ha/ve embodied, 

PaHly because certain of the arguments it contains yield further 
support to the general concltmon droAvn, and partly because 
su^h of its argwnents as answer to those included in the 
text are set forth in another way, I have decided here to append 
this omitted chapter, " The Data of Ethics" as finally daborated, was 
based on a manuscript dictated to a short-hand amanuensis, and 
written out by him in a series of copy -books, one to each chapter : 
a>n arrangement which, I suspect, accidently led to the omission 
indicated. As, on reading this rough draft, I fmd that it is 
fairly coherent and expressed with adeguaie clearness, I have 
thought it well to print it just a^ it stands. In a few places 
where the shorthamid writer failed to interpret his notes, I ha/ve 
supplied, in square brackets, what I suppose were the missing 
words; and in some other cases I hanje corrected errors that were 
obviously due to misvmderstamding or to mistranscription,'] 

§ In tlie last two cliapters Iiave been ennnciated the claims of 
egoism and altmism respectively. Each has been insisted npon 
so strongly that, taken alone, it would seem to go far toward the 
repudiation of the other. The nsnal tendency in ethical specula- 
tion is not to recognize in full both factors, as essential to hnman 
happiness, bnt to insist almost exclusively upon the one or the 
other. Or rather I should say that, in almost all cases, ignoring 
the egoistic factor, the insistence has been upon the altruistic 
one. 

At first sight it seems that there is some inconsistency in the 
position here taken. To enunciate the legitimacy of egoism in 
the way done, possibly caused the reader to think that the higher 
morality was being denied by the assertion of a system of 
selfishness. Contrariwise, reading by itself the subsequent 

19

chapter, lie miglit, if one who had before appreciated the claims 
of egoism, be led to suppose that egoism was being ignored, and 
the tacit assertion made that egoistic gratifications were to be 
achieyed through fulfilment of altruistic obligations. And 
finding that each of the chapters to a considerable extent seems 
to conflict with the other, he will incline to allege an incongruity 
of doctrine. If he does not go farther, he will at any rate be 
inclined to say that the doctrine implies a necessary incomplete- 
ness — ^implies that there can be no such thing as a life in which 
all requirements are fully satisfied. That process of evolution 
set forth in preceding chapters, will appear to be negatived by 
such incompatibility between the conflicting claims of self and 
others ; so that it cannot end in an entire equilibrium between 
human nature and its conditions. Taking by itself the chapter on 
Egoism versiM Altruism, it would seem that for the imperative 
welfare of the individual, and of those belonging to him, and of 
those afterwards descending from him, there must be such 
subordination of the claims of others, as from time to time deducts 
from their welfare or diminishes the total happiness. On the 
other hand, reading by itself the chapter on Altruism versv^ 
Egoism, it seems to be an inevitable corollary that self-abnegation, 
that is the abandonment of a gratification or the submission to a 
pain due to the craving unsatisfied, is more or less demanded of 
all, that there may be maintained that social state which, by its 
prosperity, conduces to the egoistic welfare of each, and that there 
may be also achieved the character and the capacity which are 
the means to their egoistic gratifications ; and that thus the 
pursuit of altruistic ends must of necessity entail egoistic 
deprivations. Or, to put the matter briefly, it seems to be clear 
that there must be everywhere a certain large percentage of 
sacrifice — sacrifice of others to self or sacrifice of self to others ; 
and that, in so far as there is sacrifice, there is a submission to 
pain, positive or negative, and therefore a necessary failure in the 
working out of [a] nature capable of complete life — ^that is, 
complete happiness. 

Here there remains to be shown the invalidity of this conclusion. 
On tracing upwards the process of evolution to a higher stage, 
we shall see that this conflict between egoism and altruism, which 
now constitutes the crux in all ethical speculation, is transitional, 
and is in process of gradual disappearance. 

§ Already in seeking clues for the interpretation of the future, 
we have gone back to the past ; and that we may understand the 
past have carried our inquiry back to the beginning. In seeking 
a right interpretation of egoism we set out with life in its earlier 
stages, and observed the truth that a predominant egoism, through 
which each achieved the benefits of its own superiority, was tibe

condition not only to the maintenance of life from tlie begiiming, 
bnt a condition to the maintenance of each species, and therefore 
to the evolntion of higher species. Similarly, when seeking for an 
nltimatehasisf or the claims of altruism, we observed, on going back 
to its root, that from the beginning altruism has been co-essential ; 
in so far that the continued egoism of generation after genera- 
tion, has been made possible only through the altruism which 
sacrifices, physically and otherwise, a portion of the life of each 
generation for the next. Here we may with advantage pursue, 
in seeking the ultimate conciliation of egoism and altruism, the 
same course. K we similarly go back to the beginning, we shall 
get a clue to the method by which the conciliation, already in 
certain directions achieved, will in the future be carried out to the 
full. 

For how is there effected that conciliation of the egoism and 
altruism, co-essential as we have seen, by which each race, and 
life on the globe as a whole, have been maintained and evolved P 
How is there achieved that conciliation between the egoism 
of the parent, which is essential to production and fostering of 
offspring, and the altruism by which that fostering is effected. 
The answer is perfectly simple. There has from the beginning 
been arising, and has arisen more and more to a higher and 
higher stage, such constitution in each creature, as entailed 
egoistic gratification in performing the altruistic action. 

If we glance afresh at the cases before indicated, in which 
there is a self-sacrifice of parent for the benefit of offspring, we 
observe that throughout, this self-sacrifice is made in gratifica- 
tion of a powerful instinct, and is a source of pleasure, and the 
negation of it an extreme pain. Not to dwell on cases, even low 
down among invertebrate animals, where, as even with moUusds, 
great labour is taken in safe laying of ova, or as in the case t)f 
the spider, the ova are carried about and protected till they are 
hatched — cases which show us even there, that this expenditure of 
labour by which other beings are benefited, is itself done in 
fulfilment of an instinct which is only to be satisfied by the act, 
and is therefore in that sense egoistic ; we have this relation 
forced upon us distinctly, when we come to the more highly 
organized and intelligent creatures. If we ask how it is that 
there are gone through by a pair of birds, all the labours of nest- 
building, the denial of activity implied by incubation, the activity 
of the male in feeding the female while sitting, and the prolonged 
labours of both in subsequently bringing food to the young ; the 
answer is that all these actions are carried on under the prompt- 
ings of certain inherited and organized cravings, which make the 
successive activities sources of gratification. And it needs but 
to observe the signs of distress consequent on danger to the young, 
to get a measure of the degree of pleasure taken in performing 

19*

292 APPENDIX. 

these acts that are directly beneficial to others and at the same 
time pleasurable to self. Evidently this conciliation between the 
requirements of egoism and altruism, has from the beginning 
been growing in extent and completeness — necessarily has been 
doing BO ; since the higher the type of creature evolved, the more 
the young becomes dependent upon the parent and the more 
involved the reqxiirements to be fulfilled in fostering them, and 
therefore the more continuous and more varied the activities 
carried on by adults in behalf of the young. 

And this conciliation which we see dbs gone hand-in-hand 
with evolution, is a conciliation which we see has reached a high 
degree in the human race. It needs not here to dwell on parentjEil 
sacrifices as prompted by parental jaffections. It needs not to 
dwell on the amount of positive pleasure which the mother 
derives from daily witnessing that welfare of her offspring which 
her self-sacrificing efforts achieve ; nor does it need to dwell upon 
the intensity of the unhappiness which from time to time results, 
if illness threatens or death destroys, and if, as a consequence, the 
mother, no longer called on to make these daily sacrifices, is 
at the same time defrauded of the pleasures those sacrifices 
brought. All that needs to be more especially indicated in 
further insisting on this great fact, is, that during the evolution 
of the human race itself, there has been a marked further progress 
in this conciliation ; so that whereas during savage life, the 
sacrifices made on the part of both parents are less varied and 
persistent, they endure for a shorter period, and that among 
the civilized the labours of both parents, gone through in 
rearing and education, much more complex, are prolonged over 
a greater number of years, and the labours gone through in 
accumulating the means for setting them up in life, and often 
the injury to health borne in providing them with fortunes, 
are such as to make it manifest that a large part of the 
pleasure of daily life is achieved in the process of sacrificing 
personal ends for the benefit of offspring. 

In all which illustrations the one truth to be observed and 
carried with us, is that there gradually evolves with the evolution 
of a higher life, an organic altruism, which, in relation to a 
certain limited class of other beings, works to the effect of making 
what we call self-sacrifice not a sacrifice in the ordinary sense of 
the word, but an act which brings more pleasure than pain — an 
act which has for its accompaniment an altruistic gratification 
which outweighs the egoistic gratification lost; and this, otherwise 
stated, implies that as the altruistic gratification is egoisticaUy 
expressed, egoism and altruism coalesce. 

§ That which has been in course of achievement in respect of 
the limited group of beings constituting a family, in the course

of €ke evolution of life, and has now, in tlie human race, been in 
very large measure achieved, has been in course of achievement, 
and is to a comparatively small extent achieved, with those 
larger groups constituting societies. The conciliation between 
egoism and altruism under their aspects as ordinarily understood, 
is slowly coming about by analogous conciliation of the egoistic 
and altruistic gratifications. 

Only those whose creed prompts them to believe in the 
unalterable badness of human nature, and who, in face of the 
evidence which mankind at large furnish, hold that man not only 
always has been, but always will be, " desperately wicked,** can re- 
fuse to recognize the conspicuous fact that along with the pro- 
gress of civilization, there has been growing up not only that kind 
of altruism which is shown in decreasing aggressiveness on fellow- 
men, but also that kind of altruism which is shown in actual 
regard for their welfare. Go back to the times when blood-feuds 
were not only chronic between adjacent tribes but in the later 
times in which there were blood-feuds maintained from genera- 
tion to generation between families of the same tribe, and contrast 
it with the present time in which, among civilized peoples, such 
aggressions as exist, relatively few, are far less violent in kind ; 
and it cannot be denied that that negative altruism which is 
shown in refraining from injuring others, has increased. Contrast 
the times in which slavery, existing everywhere, excited even in 
moralists no repugnance, with modem times when slavery, by 
the more sympathetically-minded, is characterized as "the sum of 
all villanies;" and it is undeniable that the extent to which 
selfish gratification is pursued at the cost of misery to others, 
is alike less extreme and less widespread. Observe the contrast 
between savages who torture their captives till they die, or 
ancient so-called heroes who dragged the dead bodies of slain 
foes after their chariots, with our own days in which, among 
the more advanced nations, wounded enemies are cared for, and 
by-standing nations send out doctors and nurses; and it cannot 
be questioned that there exists now [more kind feeling] than 
existed in the less developed human beings. So in the contrast 
between gladiatorial shows and days when pugilism is forbidden, 
or between the societies in which seeing animals slay one another 
is a chief pleasure and societies in which there exist associations 
and laws for the prevention of such remaining cruelty to 
animals as exists. 

If, from the increase of sympathy shown by the decrease 
of cruelty, we pass to that which is shown by the establish- 
ment of juster social relations, the same thing is shown to us. 
From the times when the system of internal protection was so 
little developed that men had to rectify their own grievances by 
force as well as they might, to the times when there exist

gnardians of life and property patroUing the streets at all hours, 
we are shown a gradual rise of that pnblic sentiment expressing 
regard for the claims of others. Defective as is the administra- 
tion of law, yet men's properties as well as their lives are far 
safer than they were in early times; by which there is implied an 
increase of those feelings which embody themselves in equitable 
laws. If we again look at the growth of governmental forms, 
which have gone on from period to period decreasing the un- 
checked powers of ruling classes, and extending to lower and 
lower grades shares of political power, we see both that the 
institutions so established are more altruistic in the sense 
that they recognize better the claims of all, and in the sense 
that they are advocated and carried on grounds of equity *and 
by appeal to men's sense of justice — ^that is, to the most abstract 
and latest developed of the altruistic sentiments. 

Nor is it otherwise if we consider the altruism which expresses 
itself in active benevolence. Go back to early . societies, and we 
find little or nothing representing those multitudinous agencies 
which have grown up during civilization for the care of the sick and 
aged and the unfortunate. In the rudest forms of society, those 
who were no longer from one or other cause capable of taking 
care of themselves, were either killed or left to die. But the 
moral modification which has resulted from the discipline of 
social life, as it has gradually passed more and more from the 
militant to the industrial form, has been accompanied by growth 
of multitudinous forms of philanthropic activity — countless 
societies voluntarily established and carried on, enormous sums 
of money subscribed, innumerable people busying themselves 
with a view to the welfare of those who are not so well ofE in 
the world as themselves. That is to say, altruism arising from 
that same growth of sympathy which checks cruelty and 
extends jastice, has been simultaneously leading to positive exer- 
tions for the benefit alike of individuals and of the community 
at large. 

And if we ask what is the attitude of mind in those who arc 
engaged, now in the checking of actions which infiict pain, now 
in the furtherance of political changes which conduce to more 
•quitable relations, now in the agitations for changing unjust 
laws, now in the carrying on of organizations for mitigating the 
pains of less fortunate fellow-citizens or increasing their pleasures ; 
we see that if [not] in the whole, still in large measure, the prompt- 
ing cause is an actual satisfaction in the contemplation of the 
benefits achieved. Large numbers of persons are there who, often 
postponing in large measure, and sometimes unduly, their 
private afSiirs to public affairs, are as eagerly energetic in achieving 
what they conceive will redound to human welfare at large, 
or to the welfare of particular classes of people, as though

they were pursning their personal ends ; and so show ns that 
the gratification of their altmistic feelings has become to them 
a stimulus approaching in potency to the gratification of their 
directly egoistic feelings. So that the pursuit of the altruistic 
pleasure has become a higher order of egoistic pleasure. 

§ It is a paradox daily illustrated, that the belief in irrationali- 
ties habitually goes with scepticism of rationalities. Those who 
are impressed by some statement of a wonder, and accept it on 
the strength of some emphatic assertion notwithstanding its 
utter incongruity with all that is known of the course of things, 
will listen with utter incredulity to inferences drawn by the 
most cogent reasoning from premises that they do not deny. 
Incapable of conceiving with any vividness the necessary 
dependence of conclusions upon premises, where these are 
at all remote from the simplest matters, they are not affected 
in their convictions by demonstration, however clear, as they 
are affected by the manifestation of strong belief in those who ' 
make statements to them. And thus while, for example, they 
see nothing whatever ridiculous in the tradition which ascribes 
the universe to a great artificer who was tired after six 
days' labour, it seems to them quite ridiculous to suppose 
that there are to come in the future, changes in human nature, 
and corresponding changes in hnman society, analogous to, and 
equally great with, those that have taken place since societies 
were first formed. 

One who, looking at the hour-hand of a watch, fails to see 
it move, and is prompted by his inability to see the movement 
to say that it does not move, is checked from doing so by his 
experiences of past occasions when, on looking after an interval, 
he has seen that movement has taken place ; but one can 
readily imagine that in one who had never had any experiences 
of watches, and who was told that this hour-hand was moving 
though he could not see it, and that unless familiar with the 
actions of machinery, it. would be of little avail to point out 
the arrangements of mainspring, balance-wheel, pinions, and 
the like, in such way as to prove to him that although he 
could not see it, the hour hand must be moving. And much 
in the same condition as would be such an one who had 
never before seen a watch, and who was incredulous as to the 
movement of the hour-hand because it was imperceptible to him, 
are the great mass of people who habitually look upon human 
nature and human society as, if not stationary, still, not moving 
in such way as to be likely to change their places in such 
great degree as to make them remote from what they now 
are. They have indeed the opportunity, not paralleled in the 
hypothetical case just put, of contrasting existing civilized socie-

296 AFPENBCL 

ties with existing savage societies ; and they have the opportunity 
of contrasting the present state of any one civilized society wili 
its preceding state. But strong as is the evidence furnished to 
them that both the individual human being and the masses 
of human beings, undergo decided changes, they are so domi- 
nated by the daily impression of constancy, as to have 
either unconsciousness, or no adequate consciousness, of the 
changes that are, from kindred causes, hereafter to take place. 
Not denying that there will be changes, their imagination of 
them is so vague, and their belief in them is so feeble, that, 
practically, the admission that they may take place amounts to 
nothing in their general conception of things, and plays no part 
9S a factor in their general thinking. And, most remarkably, 
this proves to be so not [only] with the commonplace uncultured 
[and] with those of mere literary culture ; but it is to a large extent 
true of those whose scientific culture should give them clear con- 
ceptions of causation — clear conceptions that results will not result 
without causes, and, conversely, that given the causes the results 
are inevitable. Even a large proportion of the biological world 
whose discipline, especially in recent years, might be presumed to 
give them full faith in the potent working hereafter of causes 
that have worked so potently heretofore, show no sign that their 
conceptions of human life and human society are much in advance 
of those held by other people. Strange to say, naturalists who 
kave accepted in full the general hypothesis of organic evolution, 
and hold that by direct or indirect adaptation, organisms have 
perpetually been moulded to their respective conditions, and that 
in the future as the past such mouldings to conditions must ever 
go on, show themselves, like the rest, little regardful of the 
oorollaries which must inevitably follow respecting the future of 
humanity. And many of them may be numbered among those 
who, in various ways, are busy in thwarting this process of adap- 
tation as respects men and society. 

Hence, not at all among the uneducated class, very little among 
the class called educated, and in no adequate degree even in 
the scientific class, is there a belief in the unquestionable truth 
that altruism in the future will increase as it has increased in 
the past ; and that as, at the present time, there has grown up in 
the superior types of men, a capacity for receiving much personal 
pleasure from furthering the welfare of others, and in contem- 
plating such welfare as is produced by other means, so will there in 
the future grow up a much greater degree, and a much more wide- 
spread amount, of such pleasure — so will there in the future come 
a further identification of altruism with egoism, in the sense that 
personal gratification will be derived from achieving the gratifica- 
tion of others. So far is it from being true, as might be supposed 
from the general incredulity, that though there has arisen a con-

siderable moralization of the Immaii being, as a concomitant of 
civilization, there will be no comparable increase of such morali- 
zation in the future, it is true that the moralization will 
hereafter go on at a much greater rate, because it will no 
longer be checked bj influences hitherto, and at present, in 
operation. During all the past, and even still, the egoism of war- 
like activities has been restraining the altruism which grows up 
under peaceful activities. The need for maintaining adaptation 
to the militant life, which implies readiness to sacrifice others, 
has perpetually held in check the progress of adaptation to the 
industrial life, which, carried on by exchange of services, does not 
of necessity entail the sacrifice of others to self. And because 
of these conflicting influences, the growth of altruism has of 
necessity been slow. What this moral modification due to the 
adaptation of human beings to peaceful social life, might have 
already achieved in civilized societies, had it not been for the 
moral effects that have accompanied the necessary process of 
compounding and re-compounding by which great nations have 
been produced, we may judge on observing the moral state exist- 
ing in the few simple tribes of men who have been so cir- 
cumstanced as to carry on peaceful lives. (Here insert 
examples.) 

Judge, then, what might by this time have happened under the 
closer mutual dependence and more complex relations which 
civilized societies have originated, but for the retarding causes 
which have kept sympathies seared ; and then judge what will 
happen in the future when, by further progress such as has been 
going on in the past, we reach eventually a state in which the 
great civilized societies reach a condition of permanent peace, 
and there continues no such extreme check as has been operating 
thus far. Not only must we infer that the future of man and 
of society will have modifications as great as the past has 
shown us, but that it will have much greater. That is to say, 
the transformation of altruistic gratifications into egoistio 
ones, will be carried very much further ; and an average 
larger share in the happiness of each individual, will depend on 
consciousness of the well-being of other individuals. 

§ Doubtless the moral modification of human nature which 
has thus to take place hereafter, analogous to that which has 
taken place heretofore, will be retarded by other causes than this 
primary cause. Not only is the growth of sympathy held in 
check by the performance of unsympathetic actions, such as are 
necessitated by militant activities, but it is held in check by the 
constant presence of pains and unhappinesses, and by the con- 
sciousness that these exist even when they are not visible. Those 
in whom the sympathies have become keen, are of necessity pro-

portionately pained on witnessing sufferings borne by otbers, not 
[only] in those eases where they are the causes of snfferings, but 
where the snfFerings are caused 'n any other way. To those whose 
fellow-feelings were too ket^nly alive to the miseries of the 
great mass of their kind — alive not only to such miseries as they 
saw but to such miseries as they hesurd of or read of, and to 
such miseries as they knew must be existing all around, far 
and near, life would be made intolerable : the sympathetic pains 
would submerge not only the sympathetic pleasures but the 
egoistic pleasures. And therefore life is made tolerable, even 
to the higher among us at the present time, by a certain per- 
petual searing of the sympathies, which keeps them down at 
such level of sensitiveness as that there remains a balance of 
pleasure in life. Whence it follows that the sympathies can 
become more and more acute, only as fast as the amount of 
human misery to be sympathized with becomes less and less ; and 
while this diminution of human misery to be sympathized with, 
itself .must be due in part to the increase of sympathy which 
prompts actions to mitigate it, it must be due in the main to the 
decrease of the pressure of population upon the means of 
subsistance. While the struggle for existence among men has to 
be carried on with an intensity like that which now exists, the 
quantity of suflfering to be borne by the majority must remain 
great. This struggle for existence must continue to be thus 
intense so long as the rate of multiplication continues greatly 
in excess of the rate of mortality. Only in proportion as the 
production of new individuals ceases to go on so greatly in 
excess of the disappearance of individuals by death, can there 
be a diminution of the pressure upon the means of subsistance, 
and a diminution of the strain and the accompanying pains 
that arise more or less to all, and in a greater degree to the 
inferior. On referring back to the Frinciples of Biology^ 
Part VI, the reader will find grounds for the inference that 
along with social progress, there must inevitably go a decrease 
in human fertility, ending in a comparative balance of fertility 
and mortality, as there comes the time when human evolution 
approaches its limit of complete adaptation to the social 
state. And as is here implied, the highest evolution of the 
sympathies, and consequent- reaching of the ultimate altruism^ 
though the progress will go on with comparative rapidity 
when a peaceful state is once arrived at, will yet only approach 
its highest degreee as this xdtimate state is approached. 

§ But one of the chief causes of perplexity in this question, 
arising from the conflict of egoistic and altruistic requirements, 
and which is natural to the present condition, is due to the fact 
that altruism is habitually associated with self-sacrifice. So long

as egoism is in excess, and so long as, in consequence of its excess, 
the counteraction of altruism is shown mainly in checking undue 
personal gratification, or in assuaging the pains that have been 
produced by selfishness somewhere or other, it happens, as a 
matter of course, that the conception of altruism is identified 
with the conception of abandonement of individual gratification, 
and self -infliction of more or less pain. This, however, as I have 
implied, is an erroneous and purely transitional view of the efEect 
of altruism in its ultimate workings out. 

Sympathy is the root of every other kind of altruism than that 
which, from the beginning, originates the parental activities. It 
is the root of that higher altruism which, apart from the philo- 
progenitive instict, produces desire for the happiness of others 
and reluctance to inflict pain upon them. These two traits are 
inevitably associated. The same mental faculty which reproduces 
in the individual consciousness, the feelings that are being dis- 
played by other beings, acts equally to reproduce those states 
when they are pleasurable or when they are painful. Sympathy, 
therefore, is a state of the individual, of pleasure or pain, according 
to the states of the surrounding beings. Consequently it happens, 
as indicated above, that when there exists around a large pro- 
portion of pain, sympathy may entail on its possessor more pain 
than pleasure, and so is continually kept in check. Contrariwise 
as, in course of the general evolution of humanity and society, 
the general increase of sympathy everywhere, and improvement 
in the social relations consequent upon greater sympathy, it more 
and more happens that the states of consciousness existing in 
those around are pleasurable ; and in proportion as this happens, 
the effect of sympathy is to increase the pleasure of the possessor. 
. Evidently the general corollary from this is that with the 
increase of sympathy, there arises the double result, that by its 
increase it tends to decrease the causes of human misery, and in 
proportion as it decreases the causes of human misery and 
increases the causes of happiness, it becomes itself the cause of 
further reflected happiness received by each from others. And 
the limit towards which this evolution approaches, is one under 
which, as the amount of pain suffered by those around from indi- 
vidual imperfections and from imperfections of social arrangement 
and conduct, become relatively small, and simultaneously the 
growth of sympathy goes on with little check, the sympathy 
becomes at the same time almost exclusively a source of pleasure 
received from the happiness of others, and not of pains received 
from their pains. And as this condition is approached, the 
function of sympathy is not that of stimulating to self-sacrifice 
and of entailing upon its possessor positive or negative pain, but 
its function becomes that of making him a recipient of positive 
pleasure. The altruism which has to arise, therefore, in future, is

not an altmism -which is in conflict with egoism, but is an 
altruism -which comes eyentuallj to coincide -with egoism in 
respect of a la^ge range of life ; and it becomes instrumental in 
exalting satisfactions that are egoistic in so feir as they are 
pleasures enjoyed by the indi-ddual, though they are altruistic in 
respect of the origin of these pleasures. 

So far then from its being, as is commonly assumed, true that 
there must go on throughout all the future, a condition in -which 
self-regard is to be continually subjected by the regard for others, 
it -will, contrariwise, be the case, that a regard for others will 
eyentnally become so large a source of pleasure, as to compete 
-with in its amount, and indeed overgrow, the pleasure which is 
derivable from direct egoistic gratification ; and the pursuit of 
this indirect egoistic gratification may so become itself the 
predominant part of egoism. 

Eventually, then, along with the approximately-complete 
adaptation of man to the social state, along with the evolution of a 
society complete in its adjustments, and along with thexdtimate 
diminution of pressure of population, which must come with the 
highest type of human life, there will come also a state in which 
egoism and altruism are so conciliated that the one merges in the 
other. 

§ To those who look at the creation at large, and the organio 
creation in particular, from the old point of view of special 
creation, and who think of the structures and Amotions of all 
species as supematurally given, and therefore fixed by God, there 
will not only be a repudiation of a conception like this as chimeri- 
cal, but there will also be an utter imperviousness to all arguments 
derived from those adaptations of constitution to conditions which 
the organic creation at large presents, and especially those which 
present adaptations of the kind here prophesied. But all who take 
the evolution view, cannot in consistency deny that if we have in 
lower orders of creatures cases in which the nature is constitu- 
tionally so modified that altruistic activities have become one 
with egoistic activities, there is an irresistible implication that a 
parallel identification will, under parallel conditions, take place 
among human beings. 

Social insects furnish us with instances completely to the point; 
and instances showing us, indeed, to what a marvellous degree the 
life of the individual may be absorbed in subserving the lives of 
other individuals. Strangely enough, it happens that the typical 
illustrations taken from the animal creation to enforce on human 
beings the virtue of activity, are taken from those creatures whose 
activities are devoted, not to their own special welfare, but to the 
welfare of the communities they form part of. The ant^ which in 
the Bible is referred to as showing an industry which should

shame the sluggard among men, and the busy bee -which, in 
the child's hymn, is named as an example to be followed in 
making the best of time, are creatures whose activities are 
not like those commended to the child and the slnggard, 
— activities mainly to be expended in subserving personal 
well-being; but they are activities which postpone individual 
well-being so completely to the well-being of the community, 
that individual life appears to be attended to only just as far 
as necessary to make possible due attention to the social life. 
These instances which are given as spurs to egoistic activity, 
are actually supplied by creatures whose activity is almost 
wholly altruistic. Throughout the animal kingdom there are 
found no better examples of energetic industry, than these in 
which the ends which the activities subserve are altruistic 
rather than egoistic. And hence we are shown, undeniably, 
that it is a perfectly possible thing for organisms to become so 
adjusted to the requirements of their lives, that energy expended 
for the general welfare may not only be adequate to check energy 
expended for the individual welfare, but may come to subordinate 
it so far as to leave individual welfare no greater than is I'equisite 
for maintenance of individual life. 

And now observe, further, that we are thus shown not only the 
existence of an almost complete identification of egoism and 
altruism ; but. we are also shown that this identification takes 
place in consequence of the gratification accompanying the 
altruistic activities having become a gratification that is sub- 
stantially egoistic. Neither the ant nor the bee can be supposed 
to have a sense of duty, in the acceptation we give to that word ; 
nor can it be supposed that it is continually undergoing self- 
sacrifice in the ordinary acceptation of that word. At the very 
outset of its mature life, the working bee begins that life 
which, with untiring energy, it pursues to the end — collecting food 
to feed the growing members of the community, gathering pollen 
with which to build new cells, and taking only just such food and 
such rest as are needful to maintain its vigour ; and in the absence 
of those moral instigations existing only in the higher vertebrates, 
the instigations are in this case simply those resulting from an 
organization which has become adjusted in the course of evolution 
to the carrying on a social life. They show us that it is within 
the possibilities of organization to produce a nature which shall 
be just as energetic, and even more energetic, in the pursuit 
of altruistic ends, as is, in other cases, shown in the pursuit of 
egoistic ends ; and they show that in such cases these altruistic 
ends are pursued in pursuing ends which on their other face 
are egoistic. For the satisfaction of the needs of the organiza- 
tion, these actions conducive to the welfare of others must be 
carried on. The seeking for the satisfaction which the organiza-

802 APP1SNDIX. 

tion requires, itself entails the performance of those activities 
which the welfare of the conununitj requires. 

§ And here we are brought to a special application of that 
general law, the relativity of pleasure, set forth and illustrated in 
a preceding chapter. We have but duly to see the far-reaching 
sequences of this law, to understand, even without such an illus- 
tration as that just furnished, that such a relation between 
the individual and the community is not only possible, but is 
certain to establish itself if the conditions to its estiEbblishmentare 
maintained. 

One who once fully grasps the truth that pleasure of every 
kind is the concomitant of the activity of some nervous structure^ 
inherited from the race or developed by modification in the in- 
dividual, will see it to be an inevitable corollary that there can 
be a gratification in altruistic activites just as great as in egoistic 
activities, if there exists the structure which answers to those 
activities; and that the evolution of such a structure will inevitably 
take place, partly by direct and partly by indirect equilibration, 
where it is to the advantage of the species that it should exist. 
In proportion as, with the advance of society to a peaceful state, 
there increases the form of social life which consists in mutual 
exchange of services — ^in proportion as it becomes to the advantage 
of the individual, and to the prosperity of the society, to regard 
other's claims and fulfil contracts — ^in proportion as the individual 
comes to be aided in leading a more complete life, by possessing a 
nature which begets friendship and kindly ofi&ces from all around ; 
in such proportion does there continuously tend to take place both 
a strengthening of the altruistic emotions directly in the individual, 
and the increase of those individuals who ii^erit most largely 
the altruistic nature. And in proportion as there goes on this 
individual modification, conducing ever to the prosperity of the 
society after the peaceful [stage] has been reached, in that same 
proportion does it also happen iiiat among societies those among 
whom that modification has gone on most efEectually will be those 
to [survive and grow, so as gradually to replace those societies] 
in which the individual nature is not so adapted to social require- 
ments. Inevitably, therefore, by this process, the tendency of 
peaceful conditions is to the continual increase of those faculties^ 
that is, those nervous structures, which have for their spheres of 
activity, pleasure taken in the welfare of others ; and in pro- 
portion as this takes place, there is evolved more and more a 
nature in which the egoistic pursuit of these pleasures, arising 
from the activity of the altruistic feelings, becomes a source of 
such altruistic activities as are needful for the general welfare. 
As certainly as those organized and inherited structures which 
prompt the activities of the chase, in animals and in men who

THE CONCILIATION. 803 

live by the chase, and which, snrviving in civilized men, give them 
what seems so natural, the pleasure in achieving the success of 
the chase, are structures which prompt to actions in pursuit of 
gratification apart from future egoistic ends (for the sportsman 
may be indifferent to the game he kills) ; so are there growing 
np, and will still further grow up with the progress towards 
a peaceful state, structures which will prompt to altruistic 
activities, and which will find their gratification in those 
altruistic activities quite apart from any egoistic motives. 

Anyone who looks around and observes the higher types of 
men and women already existing, will see that even now the 
evolution of such structures has made considerable progress ; and 
that there is no limit to the progress, save reaching the height at 
which it completely fulfils requirements.

BEPUES TO CRITICISMS. 

[The following replies to criticisms originally appeared in 
Mind, for January, 1881. J have thought it well to give them 
here a permanent place, hecattse, in making them, I have had occa- 
sion fwrther to elucidate certain of the doctrines set forth in the 
preceding pages."] 

As ethical writer who was required to treat of right and 
wrong conduct, while saying nothing about any purpose to be 
effected by conduct, would be greatly perplexed. Were he 
forbidden to bring in the thoughts of good, better and best, in 
relation to results, moral distinctions among actions would not 
be easily expressed. I mak e this remark because Mr. Sidgwick, 
in his article in Mind, XVIII., entitled " Mr. Spencer's Ethical 
System,'' quoting from me the phrase, " conduct falling short of 
its ideal," remarks — 

** The frankly teleological point of yiew from which, in this book, Mr. Spencer 
contemplates the phenomena of Life generally, seems worthy of notice ; since 
in his Principles of Biology he seems to hare taken some pains to avoid 
' teleological implications '." 

That a science which has for its subject-matter the characters 
of the ends pursued by men, and the characters of the means 
used for achieving such ends, can restrict itself te statements in 
which ends are not implied, is a strange assumption. Teleology of 
a kind is necessarily involved ; and the only question is whether it 
is of the legitimate or the illegitimate kind. The contrast between 
the two may readily be shown by a biological illustration. If I 
speculate concerning the stony shell of a Gromwell-seed,' so hard 
that it is uninjured by the beak of a bird which swallows the seed, 
and eflfectually resists the grinding actions of the bird's gizzard ; 
and if I argue that this hard shell was provided for the purpose 
of protecting the seed, and thus securing its eventual germination ; 
I am arguing teleologically in the vicious way. If, on the other 
hand, my interpretation is that among the seeds of some remote 
ancestral plant, one with an unusually thick shell passed away 
uninjured by a bird's beak and stomach, while the rest wim 
thinner shells were broken up and digested ; and if I infer that 
among the seeds of the plant originating from the undigested

seed, generally inheriting this greater thickness, those most 
frequently lived and propagated which had the thickest or 
hardest shells, nntil, by survival of the fittest, shells of this 
extreme density, completely protective, were produced ; and if I 
a«rgue that maintenance of the species was throughout this pro- 
cess the end more effectually subserved; I am also arguing 
teleologically, but in the legitimate way. There enters the 
conception of a cause for the genesis of the hard shell, which is, 
in a sense, a final cause — ^not that proximate cause constituted 
by the physiological processes going on in the plant, but a cause 
remote from these, which, nevertheless, so far determines them 
that in its absence they would not exist. And it is thus with 
biological interpretations of structures and functions in general. 
Tne welfare of the organism, or of the species, is in every case 
/me end to further which a structure exists ; and the difference 
between a legitimate and an illegitimate teleology is that, while 
the one explains its existence as having gradually arisen by 
furthering the end, the other gives no explanation of its exist- 
ence other than that it was put there to further the end — a final 
catise of the " barren virgin " sort. 

Throughout the Lata of Ethics, as throughout every ethical 
treatise, ends are constantly in view, and the interpretations 
have unceasing reference to them. I have, indeed, in a chapter 
on " The Physical View " of Ethics, treated of conduct as low 
or high, according as it subserves in a less or greater degree, 
maintenance of a moving equilibrium ; which is, I think, a more 
unteleological way of regarding it than has been followed by any 
ethical writer. In this chapter, the evolution of that which we 
ordinarily conceive as higher conduct, is presented as a process 
expressible in terms of matter and motion. For the implication 
of the argument (in harmony with an argument contained iu two 
chapters in the Principles of Biology on direct and indirect 
equilibration) is that, inevitably, those aggregates in which the 
moving equilibrium is the best, are those which remain out- 
standing when others disappear ; and that so, by inheritance, the 
tendenc^ is to the establishment of an ever-better moving equili- 
brium : higher conduct is defined apart even from consciousness 
— apart from alleged human ends or assumed divine ends. 
When, in the next chapter, it is shown that what we call, in 
physical language, a better moving equilibrium, is, in biological 
language, a better fulfilment of functions, and, consequently, a 
life which is at once wider and longer ; the implication is that a 
wider and longer life being the end, conduct is to be judged by 
its conduciveness to this end ; and throughout two subsequent 
chapters this point of view is maintained. But these chapters 
are nowhere illegitimately teleological. Had I accepted the

moral-sense doctrine as ordinarily -understood — ^had I alleged in 
mankind a snpematurallj-giyen conscionsness of obligation — 
had I asserted that men are endowed with sympathy to enable 
them the better to co-operate in the social state ; I shonld have 
been chargeable with teleological interpretation of the vicions 
kind. Bnt since my interpretation is avowedly opposed to this 
— since I regard those faculties, which produce a conduct favour- 
able to welfare under the conditions imposed by the social state, 
as themselves the products of social life, and contend that they 
have step by step established themselves by furthering social life, 
the charge seems to me peculiarly inapplicable. 
. Another criticism made by Mr. Sidgwick is that I have not 
given that disproof of Pessimism which, for the substantiation 
of my doctrine, I am bound to give. He writes : — 

'* Now, aiter all that has been said of the importance of consideriiig human 
condnct in connexion with the ' nniversal conduct ' of which it is a part, I think 
that this transition from * quantity of life ' which was stated to he the end of 
the latter to ' quantity of pleasure ' is too rapidly and lightly made. Pessimism, 
.as Mr. Spencer himself says, stands in the way, declaring that life does not 
bring with it a surplus of agreeable feeling. Wa expect therefore a scientific 
confntatiop of Pessimism ; and I am unable to perceiye that this expectation is 
ever adequately realized. Indeed I am unable to find any passage in which 
Mr. Spencer expressly undertakes such a confutation. And yet he can hardly 
thinkxhat pessimism is sufficiently confuted by demonstrating that the common 
moral judgments of mankind imply the assumption that life, on the average, 
yields a surplus of pleasure over pain. This is not establishing morality on a 
scientific basis." 

I am surprised that one so acute in making distinctions as 
Mr. Sidgwick, should have so greatly misapprehended my posi- 
tion. It is perfectly true that I nowhere expressly undertake a 
confutation of Pessimism ; but it is also true that it nowhere 
devolves upon me to do this. If Mr. Sidgwick will re-read the 
chapter in which is referred to the controversy of Pessimism 
versvs Optimism, he will perceive that I have uttered no judg- 
ment concerning the issue, and that, for the purpose of my' 
argument, no such judgment is called for. My motive for 
comparing their views, was to show that " there is one postulate 
in which pessimists and optimists agree. Both their arguments 
assume it to be self-evident that life is good or bad, according as 
it does, or does not, bring a surplus of agreeable feeling." By 
proving that the two schools have this postulate in common, I 
am not committed to any judgment concerning the truth of 
either of their conclusions. I have said that if the pessimist is 
right, " actions furthering its [life's] continuance, either in self or 
others, must be reprobated;" while, conversely, they must be 
approved if the optimist is right: the implication being that 
oppjosite systems of ethics emerge according as one or other of 
their estimates of life is accepted, but that both systems pro*

ceed upon the assumption that happiness is the end of conduct. 
The sole object of the chapter is to show ** that no school can 
avoid taking for the ultimate moral aim, a desirable state of 
feeling, called by whatever name — ^gratification, enjoyment, 
happiness." Surely it is one thing to contend that optimists 
and pessimists agree in the belief that life is of value only 
if it has, on the average, an accompaniment of desirable con- 
sciousness, and another thing to contend that it has such an 
accompaniment. Had Mr. Sidgwick said that by the genefal 
argument of the work I have tacitly committed myself to the 
optimistic view, he would have said rightly. But, as shown, 
my reference to the controversy was made without any such 
purpose as that of justifying optimism ; and my position was 
clearly enough implied to be that the arguments of the work 
are valid only for optimists. 

But now, having pointed out that the conclusions contained 
in the Data of Ethics, in common with the conclusions contained 
in ethical treatises at large, can reasonably be accepted only by 
those who hold that life in the aggregate brings more pleasure 
than pain, or, at any rate, is capable of bringing more pleasure 
than pain, I go on to show that the tacit optimism which per- 
vades the work, has a wider basis than Mr. Sidgwick recognizes. 
He says that "in Mr. Spencer's view, pessimism is indirectly 
confuted by the argument — given as an 'inevitable deduction 
from the hypothesis of evolution' — which shows that "neces- 
sarily throughout the animate world at large, pains are the 
correlatives of actions injurious to the organism, while pleasures 
are the correlatives of actions conducive to its welfare.' *' This 
is true as far as it goes ; but, ignoring as he does all passages 
concerning the universal process of adaptation, Mr. Sidgwick 
omits a large part of the evidence favouring optimism. The 
chapter on the " Relativity of Pains and Pleasures," sets forth and 
illustrates the biological truth that everywhere faculties adjust 
themselves to the conditions of existence, in such wise that the 
activities those conditions require become pleasurable. The 
pains accompanying the inactions of faculties for which changed 
conditions have left no spheres, diminish as the faculties de- 
crease; while the pains accompanying the actions of faculties 
over-taxed under the new conditions, diminish as the faculties 
grow, and become pleasures when those faculties have acquired 
the strengths which fulfilment of the conditions requires. This 
law is alike inferable a 2>riori and proved a posteriori, and yields 
a qualified optimism as its corollary — an optimism qualified by 
the conclusion that the life of every species of creature is happy 
or miserable according to the degree of congruity or incongruity 
between its nature and its environment ; but that everywhere,

decrease of the misery or increase of tHe happiness, accompanies 
the ineyitable progress towards congruity. Whence it follows 
that in the case of mankind, pessimism may be locally true 
nnder certain conditions (as those which have fostered the creed 
which makes annihilation a blessing), while optimism may be 
locally true nnder conditions of a more favourable kind ; but 
that with the increasing adaptation of humanity to social life, the 
excess of pleasures over pains which warrants optimism, must 
become ever greater. And here let me point out in passing, how, 
in so £ar as judgment of an ethical system depends on the tacit 
acceptance of optimistic or pessimistic views, it can be rightly 
guided only by a knowledge of biological laws. Mr. Sidgwick 
is at one with moralists in general in thinking that the truth or 
falsehood of moral doctrines may be determined without study of 
the laws of life. He asks " In what way then does Science — 
that is, Biology, Psychology, and Sociology— provide a basis for 
this * truer ethics ' " ; and in a large measure the purpose of his 
criticism is to show that such science does this in no appreciable 
way. Above, however, we see that the acceptability of a system 
of ethics, depending as it does on the pre-acceptance of optimism 
or pessimism, depends on the pre-acceptance or pre-rejection of 
certain ultimate biological generalizations. It is, indeed, looked 
at broadly, a remarkable belief that while ethical science is con- 
cerned with certain phenomena of life, it is a matter of indifference 
in judging about these phenomena, whether the laws of life are 
known or not. 

The way in which Mr. Sidgwick ignores biological generaliza- 
tions, is curiously shown in a subsequent passage, in which, 
respecting the ethical method I contend for, he says : — 

<'For inBtance, its scientific claims are plainly declared in chapter y., on 

* Ways of Judging Conduct;* from which we learn that Mr. Spencer's way of 
judging it is to be a high priori road. He will not rely on mere generalization 
from observation of the actual consequences of different kinds of conduct ; it 
is the defect of current utilitarianism that it does not get beyond these merely 
empirical generalizations ; Mr. Spencer, on the o&er hand, proposes to 

* ascertain necessary relations ' between actions and their consequences, and so 
to ' deduce from fundamental principles what conduct must be detrimental and 
what niTAst be beneficial.' Those are brave words, &c." 

If, concerning an artillery officer who, instead of ascertaining 
experimentally the ranges given by certain elevations of his gun, 
calculated these ranges from the laws of motion and atmospheric 
resistance, Mr. Sidgwick were to say that he pursued the " high 
priori road," he would apply this expression with much the 
same propriety; since the method I contend for is that of 
deducing from the laws of life under given conditions, results 
which follow from them in the same necessary way bs does the 
trajectory of a cannon-shot from the laws of motion and atmos-

pheric resisfcance. All developed science may be characterized 
as " high priori," if the drawing of deductions from premises 
positively ascertained by induction, is to be so called. Had I 
given no explanation of my meaning, I sbonld have been less 
surprised at the passage above quoted. But by a series of 
examples, beginning with the innutrition of a limb which 
follows tying of its main artery and ending with the social 
mischiefs caused by calumny, I have, in § 22, shown what I mean 
by the derivation of ethical principles from the laws of life ; 
and I have, in subsequent chapters, exhibited this derivation 
systematically. Nevertheless, because, during our transitional 
state, in which humanity is changing and social conditions are 
changing, this method does not suffice for development of a code 
of conduct in full detail, Mr. Sidgwick, ignoring the derivations 
of the leading moral restraints in the section I have named, and 
in the subsequent chapters, thinks the reader will be " disap- 
pointed." With equal reason might he represent the biological 
student as disappointed because, from physiological laws as at 
present ascertained, the details of pathology and therapeutics 
cannot be inferred. 

All this, however, is introductory to Mr. Sidgwick's criticism 
on the view I take of the relation between Absolute Ethics and 
Belative Ethics. My position is that, as all ethical theory is 
concerned with ideas of worse and better in conduct, and that as 
the conception of better involves the conception of best, there is, 
in all cases, an ideal conduct tacitly assumed ; that before valid 
conclusions can be drawn, this ideal conduct must be conceived 
not in a vague and shifting way, but definitely and consistently ; 
and that no definite and consistent conception of ideal conduct 
can be framed without assuming ideal social conditions. Mr. 
Sidgwick does not, I think, show that this position is untenable, 
but contents himself with raising difficulties. Into the details of 
his criticism I cannot follow him without occupying too much 
space. I may, however, deal generally with the view he finally 
implies, that such an ideal is useless, and that the theory of 
human and social evolution has no practical bearing on the 
guidance of conduct. He says : — 

*^ Even if we could constract scientificalljr Mr. Spencer's ideal code, I do not 
think Buch a code would be of much avail in solving the practical problems of 
actual humanity. . . . Even supposing that this ideal society is ultimately 
to be realized, it must at any rate be separated from us by a considerable 
interval of evolution ; hence it is not unlikely that the best way of progressing 
towards it is some other than the apparently directest way, and that we shall 
reach it more easily if we begin by moving away from it." 

And Mr. Sidgwick concludes that " the humble and imperfect 
empirical method " can be our only guide.

SIO AFF£NDIZ. 

Here, then, we bave a distinct statement of tbe opinion tibat 
for practical purposes it comes to the same thing whether we 
do or do not entertain an ideal of conduct and of society. In 
onr estimate of a proximately best, it will niake no difference 
whether we have or have not any conception of an ultimately 
best. So long as the immediate efEects of a measure promise to 
be good, it is needless to consider whether, while achieving 
them, we cause changes in men and society, and whether, if we 
cause changes, these will carry men and society towards, or 
away from, their highest forms. This position may be dealt 
with first generally and then more specially. 

The empirical method, as upheld by Mr. Sidgwick, estimating, 
as well as may be, good and evil results, that is, totals of 
pleasures and pains, postulates as a necessary basis for its 
conclusions, constancy of relation between pleasures and their 
causes and l3etween pains and their causes. If, from experience 
of men as we now know them, it is inferred that a certain policy 
will be conducive to a surplus of pleasures over pains ; and il 
the establishment of that policy, say by public institutions, is 
considered as therefore ethically justifiable, or rather, imperative ; 
then the implied assumption is that the surplus of pleasures 
over pains producible by this course in existing men, wUl also be 
producible in their descendants. This, however, cannot be 
inferred unless it is assumed that men will remain the same. 
Hence the question whether men are or are not changing, 
becomes an essential question. If they are not changing, the 
empirical estimates may be valid. If they are changing, these 
estimates must be doubtful, and may be entirely false. It needs 
but to contrast the pleasures of combat, which a Norseman 
conceived as those of his heaven, with the pleasures pursued by 
a modem man of letters, or to contrast the repiignance which a 
savage shows to continued industry, with the eager pursuit of 
business by a citizen, to see that this change in the relations 
between actions and the accompanying feelings, is no nominal 
difficulty in the way of the empirical method. It becomes 
manifest that if humanity is undergoing modifications, then, 
guidance of conduct by valuations of pleasures and pains, 
assuming as it does that what is true now will continue to be 
true, is a guidance likely to be erroneous. Be it a policy 
advocated, a law passed, an agency set up, a discipline used, an 
injunction urged, if its sole warrant is that of furthering the 
happiness of men as they are, then, if men are becoming other 
than they are, furtherance of their happiness in futxire cannot be 
inferred ; and there may resxilt hindrance to their happiness. 

Mark, now, another implication. If it is admitted, as it must 
be, that guidance by estimated surplus of pleasures over pains, 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



fiEFLIES TO CRITICISMS. 811 

as now observable, is vitiated if the relationa between actions 
and feelings change ; then it mnst also be admitted that guidance 
by such estimated surplus can be made trustworthy, only by 
knowledge of the ways in which these relations change. K we 
simply know that these relations between actions and feelings 
will change, without knowing how they will change, then we 
simply know that our empirical guidance will go wrong, without 
knowing the way in which it will go wrong. Hence the ques- 
tion, whether there is at work that adaptation of constitution 
to conditions which the doctrine of evolution ilnplies, becomes 
the cardinal question. If, recognizing the relativity of pleasures 
and pains, we conclude that those activities which social life 
necessitates in men, tend to become more pleasurable, while 
the pains caused by the restraints on unfit activities diminish, 
then the question of first importance becomes — What general 
form of activities is it to which humanity is being adjusted ? 
— ^what are the ideal social conditions tp which men's natures 
are being so moulded that they will have no desires out 
of harmony with those conditions ? If we can frame a con- 
ception of the ideal social state, and of human conduct as carried 
on in it, then we have a means of correcting whatever empirical 
guidance may be obtained by valuation of pleasures and pains 
as now experienced ; since, beyond the immediate effects of 
any course, we are enabled to see whether the ultimate effects 
are such as further or hinder the required re-moulding of human 
nature. 

The contrast between Mr. Sidgwick's belief and mine, re- 
specting the relation between ethical doctrine and the theory of 
human and social evolution, will best be shown by an analogy. 
In the moral education of a child, proximately good results 
may be obtained in various ways. Its crying may be stopped 
by a bon-bon ; or its mother may alarm it by a threat ; it may be 
led to learn a lesson by fear, or by the promise of a treat, or by 
the desire to please ; and in later childhood there may come, on 
the part of the father, a control which maintains order by regu- 
lating every action, or one which allows a considerable amount 
of freedom and concomitant experience of good and evil results. 
Is it, or is it not, desirable to keep in view the fact that presently 
the child will be a man, and to frame a conception of what the 
man ought to be ? Yery frequently the mother, pursuing the 
empirical method and achieving proximately good results, 
ignores the question of this ideal and the conduciveness of her 
discipline to achievement of it ; and not uncommonly the father, 
especially if of the clerical sort, making numerous peremptory 
rules, considers scarcely at all whether his much-regulated boy 
is acquiring the qualities which v^ill make him a self-regulating

man. Sball we say that sncli proximately beneficial methods 
are the best which can be devised ; or shall we not rather say 
that there can be no good education which does not bear the 
ideal constantly in view, and consider methods partly in 
reference to their immediate results, but still more in reference 
to their ultimate results P And if so, must we not say the same 
with respect to adult humanity, which undergoes an education 
by social discipline ? Of course if Mr. Sidgwick agrees with 
those who hold that human nature is unchangable, his position is 
tenable. But if he admits that man is adaptable, it becomes of 
some importance to consider of every proposed course, whether, 
by the entailed modification of conditions, it furthers or hinders 
progress towards the highest conditions and the highest human 
nature accompanying them. Though our steering must doubtless 
be proximately guided by recognition of rocks and sandbanks, 
yet, if we befieve in a haven to be eventually reached, it is 
needful from time to time to consxdt the compass, and see 
whether, while avoiding the rocks and sandbanks, we are also 
moving towards our haven. 

Had this reply to Mr. Sidgwick been published immediately 
after his criticism, I should probably have said no more in defence 
of my views. But there have since appeared in Mind two other 
criticisms, respecting which it now seems needful to say some- 
thing. The first in order of date is that of Prof. Means (No. 
XIX). Space will not allow me to deal with it more than briefly. 

Prof. Means considers that I am unjustified in -saying of 
current Utilitarianism that it is purely empirical, and in con- 
trasting it with what I distinguish as rational tTtilitarianism. 
Considering that, as we have just seen, Mr. Sidgwick, who is 
now the foremost representative of Utilitarianism as hitherto 
conceived, argues against me that it must continue to be purely 
empirical, the injustice of my allegation is not apparent. By 
way of showing that Mr. Mill, in his Logic, takes the same view 
that I do, Prof. Means says : — 

** The very illustration used by Mr. Spencer in regard to * the course of one 
who studies pathology without previous study of physiology ' as resembling 
the usual course of moralists, is one used by Mill for precisely the same 
purpose :-~* Students in politics thus attempted to study the pathology and 
therapeutics of the social body, before they had laid the necessary foundation 
in its physiology.* " 

And there follows what seems to be an insinuation that I was 
cognizant of this passage. Some thirty years ago I probably 
was. I read Mr. Mill's Logic in 1851 or 1852, and save those 
parts which, in successive editions, have concerned the amicable 
controversy carried on between us respecting the test of truth, 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



BEPLIES TO CRITICISMS. 313 

I have not read it since. I go on to remark that, as the passage 
itself shows, and as appears more fully on turning to the volume, 
the analogy as used by Mr. Mill refers to social science ; while 
the analogy is used by me in elucidation of ethical science. 
Prof. Means says it is " used by Mill for precisely the same 
purpose." Now though it is true that poHtics and morals are 
intimately, related, the belief that they are identical is, I think, 
peculiar to Prof. Means, and is likely to remain so. 

Let us, however, turn to the main issue — whether the Utili- 
tarianism of Mr. Mill and previous writers of the same school, 
did or did not recognize that dependence of ethical laws upon 
the laws of life, which I have insisted upon, and did or did not 
propose to establish them deductively from such laws. To 
whatever extent it may be true that utilitarians have been con- 
scious of a relation between rules of right conduct and the 
furtherance, direct or indirect, of vital activities, there could not 
come the full conception of a resxdting method, until biological 
generalizations of the widest kind had been reached and accepted 
as data for ethical reasoning. Now up to recent times, biological 
generalizations of this widest kind had either not been reached 
at all, or were known only by naturalists, and accepted by very 
few of these. In Bentham's day, the consequences deducible 
from the universal law of adaptation, could not take their place 
in ethical speculation ; for the reason that, in the sense involved 
by the doctrine of Evolution, this law had not been heard of by 
ninety-nine cultivated people out of a hundred, and was pooh- 
poohed by nearly all those who had heard of it. Again, whatever 
occasional observations had been made respecting the relations 
of pleasures and pains to bodily welfare, could not lead to any 
such ethical conclusions as those involved by acceptance of the 
doctrine of Evolution, which implies that life of the sentient 
kind has continued and developed only in virtue of these 
relations. Nor, without the doctrine of the relativity of pains 
and pleasures, established by a wide biological induction, could 
there be completed the necessary basis for a scientific ethics. 
Similarly, into that division of ethics which is concerned with 
its psychology, the theory of mental evolution enters as an 
indispensable factor. Though Mr. Mill did not combat the 
hypothesis of inherited mental modifications, yet he never 
adopted it in such a way as to qualify his experiential interpre- 
tation of ideas and feelings ; and, consequently, he was debarred 
&om entertaining that view of the moral sentiments and moral 
intuitions, which yields an explanation of their varying functions 
under varying social conditions, and afEords a warrant for 
inferring their ultimate adjustment to an ultimate social state. 
In brief, then, the laws of life and of mind, referred to by me as

814 APPENDIX. 

those from whicli a scientiflo ethics is to be deduced, are laws 
which were either not known, or not admitted, by ntilitarians o-f 
the empirical school ; and it was therefore not possiHe for them 
to entertain that conception of rational ethics which I have put 
in antithesis to empirical ethics. 

Prof. Means comments on the contrast I have drawn between 
justice as an end and happiness as an end. He quotes me as 
saying that — 

Justice *< * IB concerned excludvely with quantity under stated conditioMt 
whereas happiness is concerned with both qiumtity and guaUty under 007^ 
ditions not stated \ It refers to * the relatiye amonnts of actions, or products, 
or benefits, the natures of which are recosmized only so far as is needful for 
saying whether as much has been given, or done, or allowed, by each con- 
cerned, as was implied by tacit or overt understanding, to be an equiva- 
lent."* 

To which he objects that — 

*' * Differences of age, of growth, of constitutional need, differences of 
activity and consequent expenditure, differences of desires and tastes,' which 
Mr. Spencer thinks impossible to be estimated by a utilitarian, must all be 
estimated before any course of action can be said to be equivalent to any 
other course. And if a comparison of pleasures is impossible, this estimate is 
impossible.'' 

The reply is that justice as I have defined it, justice as formu- 
lated in law," and justice as commonly understood, is satisfied 
when those concerned have so acted that no one has been 
trespassed against by another, and, in case of contract, each has 
done all that was agreed to be done by him. If there has been 
direct aggression, greater liberty of action has been taken by the 
aggressor than by the one aggressed upon. If there has been 
indirect aggression by breach of contract, such greater liberty of 
action has again been taken : one has broken the understanding 
while the other has not — one has seized some advantage beyond 
that given as an equivalent, while the other has not. Justice is 
not concerned with the relative values of benefits or happinesses, 
as Prof. Means implies, but only with the relative degrees of 
freedom used in pursuing benefits or happinesses ; and if neither 
by direct or indirect trespass have these degrees been made 
unequal, there is no injustice. If it be said, as by Prof. Means 
concerning wages given for labour, that very often men are 
practically coerced by social arrangements into making agree- 
ments they would not otherwise have made ; then, the injustice 
exists not in the agreements unwillingly made, but in the social 
arrangements which have interfered with free volition. If, as 
appears from his argument, Prof. Means holds that justice com- 
prises, not simply a regulation of actions such that each man 
shall leave others as much freedom to pursue their ends as he 
himself makes, but that justice involves the establishment of

BEFLIES TO CSITIOISHS. 315 

equivalence between advantages gained by co-operation, then 
the reply is that I am not concerned with justice as so conceived. 
There are socialists who hold that there should be an equal 
division of benefits among men, irrespective of the values of their 
several labours. To many it seems unjust that the hard work of 
a ploughman should bring in a week, not so much as a physician 
easily gains in a quarter of an hour. Some persons contend that 
it is unjust that children bom to the poor should not have educa- 
tional advantages like those of children bom to the rich. But 
such deficiencies in the shares of happiness some men get by 
co-operation, as arise from the inferior natures they inherit, 
or from the inferior circumstances into which their inferior 
ancestors have fallen, are deficiencies with which justice, as I 
understand it, has nothing to do. The injustice which entails on 
posterity diseases and deformities — the injustice which inflicts on 
ojffspring the painful results of stupidity and misconduct in 
parents — the injustice which compels those who inherit incapaci- 
ties to struggle with resulting difficulties — the injustice which 
leaves in comparative poverty the great majority, whose powers, 
of low order, bring them small returns, is an injustice of a kind 
lying outside of my argument. We have to accept, as we may, 
the established constitution of things, though under it an 
inferiority for which the individual is not blamable, brings its 
evils, and a superiority for which he can claim no merit, brings 
its benefits ; and we have to accept, as we may, all those result- 
ing inequalities of advantages which citizens gain by their 
(respective activities. But while it does not devolve upon me 
to defend the order of Nature, I may say again, as I have said 
at greater length already (§ 69), that only in virtue of the 
law under which every creature takes the good and bad results 
entailed by its inherited organization, has life advanced to its 
present height and can continue to advance. A so-called justice 
which should equalize advantages apart from capacities, would be 
fatal ; while the justice, rightly so-called, which insists that each 
shall be as free as others to make the best of his powers, and that 
nothing shall intervene between his efforts and the returns they 
naturally bring (as decided by agreement) is beneficient imme- 
diately and remotely. This is the justice which, as an end, I 
have contended is more intelligible than happiness as an end ; 
and I decline to be entangled by Prof. Means in the difficulties 
which arise when there is substituted a justice which contem- 
plates equivalence of results. 

The remainder of Prof. Means' criticisms I must pass over 
with the remark that,* throughout, they similarly display an 
unusual facility in identifying things which are different.

I turn, now, to the article of Mr. Alfred W. Benn — " Another 
View of Mr. Spencer's Ethics," contained in the last number of 
Mind. Here, too, I must limit myself to the earKer criticisms. 

Mr. Benn blames me for expressing a positive opinion respect- 
ing the inevitableness of the hedonistic view of morals. He 
says:— 

** To declare pleasure a necessary form of moral intuition must in the pre- 
sent state of the controyersy be pronounced a piece of unwarrantable 
dogmatism." 

As commonly understood, dogmatism implies authorative asser- 
tion without the giving of reasons. Considering that the 
passage to which Mr. Benn refers, closes a chapter devoted 
to an examination of all the various standards of goodness 
in conduct ; and considering that the analysis aims to show, 
and does, I think, show, that happiness as an ultimate end is in 
every case involved ; it seems to me an unusual application of the 
word to characterize as dogmatic, a proposition which sums up 
the results of the inquiry. A dogmatism which appeals step by 
step to the judgment of the reader, is of a species not before 
known. 

I remark this by way of introduction to Mr. Benn's first 
criticism. Respecting my statement that optimists and pessi- 
mists by their arguments both imply acceptance of the hedonistic 
view, Mr. Benn says : — 

"Here with all deference I must observe that Mr. Spencer is doubly if 
not trebly mistaken. In the first place, although Schopenhauer and his 
school are hedonists, it is perfectly possible to be a pessimist without thinking 
that pleasure is the end of life and that we do not get enough of it. Some 
persons if they were conyinced that certain knowledge was unattainable, even 
if they expected it to yield them no pleasure, might regard that as a reason for 
preferring non-existence to existence. In the second place, as it is generally 
better if possible to meet your adversary on his own ground, an optimist 
who believes that life affords a surplus of pleasurable feeling may very well 
advance that argument without conceding that such a surplus alone makes 
life worth having. And, thirdly, as a matter of fact the optimists do not 
make this concession. M. Caro, an eminent representative of the spiritualistic 
school in France, has distinctly declared that granting the excess of pain 
over pleasure to be possible and even probable, he still remains an optimist, 
that even an unhappy life is worth living, and that suffering is preferable 
to nonentity." 

The first of the three proofs that I am mistaken is curiously 
hypothetical. " Some persons " " might regard " non-existence 
as preferable to existence, if they thought " certain knowledge 
was unattainable," even if they expected no pleasure from 
attaining it. Disproof of my statement concerning the beings 
we know, by the help of supposable beings, is not, I think, very 
satisfactory. But passing over this, let me point out that if tlje 
attainment of " certain knowledge " were an adequate motive for 
existence, and inability to attain it a motive for preferring non-

existence, it is difficult to conceive otherwise than that the 
attainment of it would be a satisfaction ; and a satisfaction of 
whatever nature is a kind of pleasure. To say that the attain- 
ment of the knowledge was not expected to yield them any 
pleasure, is to say that they would regard the attainment of the 
knowledge with indifference ; and if they were indifferent to the 
attainment of it, how could attaiument of it be regarded as a 
sufficient reason for preferring existence to non-existence ? 

Mr. Benn's second disproof, somewhat hypothetical also, does 
not, I think, much strengthen his case. He says : — 

" An optimist who believes that life affords a snrplns of pleasurable feeling 
may very well advance that argument without conceding that such a sur- 
plus alone makes life worth haying." 

Is this really another disproof, or only the same re-stated ? With- 
out naming any end, other than pleasurable feeling, which 
" makes life worth having," it alleges that even an optimist may 
believe in such an end. I do not see that by leaving this end 
unspecified, and supposing an optimist who thinks it a sufficient 
end, the argument is made different from the last ; and the same 
reply serves. The end, of whatever nature, being one which it is 
desirable to attain rather than not attain, implies satisfaction 
of desire, or pleasure. The third argument states in the concrete 
that which is stated in the abstract in the preceding two, and is 
the sole argument. This argument is that M. Caro thinks " even 
an unhappy life is worth living ". Now I suspect that were M. 
Caro cross-examined, it would turn out that the unhappy life 
which he thinks worth living, is one which, though it brings 
misery to the possessor, does not bring misery to others, but con- 
duces to their happiness.* If M. Caro means that life is worth 
living even on condition that its possessor, suffering misery 
himself in common with all individuals, shall aid them in 
living that they may continue to suffer misery, and shall beget 
and rear children that they, too, may pass lives of misery ; and 
if M. Caro means that misery is to be the fate of all, not only 
here but during the hereafter he believes in ; then, indeed, and 
only then, does he exclude happiness as an end. Bnt if M. Caro 
says he believes that even under such conditions life woald be 
worth living, then I venture to class him with those who have 
not practised introspection. I once heard a person assert that a 

* Since this was written I have referred to M. Caro's essay, and find he 
says that if there is really an excess of suffering in the average of human 
life, " il ne faut pas s'empresser d'en conclure que le pessimisme a raison, 
que le mal de la vie est absola, gu' iX est vMwrdbW^ Which makes it clear 
that M. Caro had in the back^und of his consciousness the conception of 
misery to be diminished, that is, happiness to be increased, as a reason for 
tolerating present misery ; and probably this conception was not wholly 
absent when he wrote — " la souffrance vaut mieux que le n^ant.*'

cat thrown across a room coxild drop in tHe middle if it pleased ; 
and, presumably, this person thonght he conld himself do the 
same. The defective conscionsness of his mechanical powers 
which this person displayed, is, I think, parallelled by M. Carols 
def ectire conscionsness of his mental powers, if he thinks he can 
believe that existence would be preferable to non-existence did 
it bring pain to all men thronghont all time. 

Mr. Benn, however, regards this testimony of M. Caro as con- 
clusive. If there is Anyone who says he thinks that universal 
and eternal human misery is better than non-existence, we must 
accept his seK-interpretation as settling the question ; for men 
never misconceive their own thoughts or fail to understand their 
own feelings. And then Mr. Benn continues : — 

'' A fortiori wonld sach persons maintain that a perfectly nentral state of 
consciousness, a life totally devoid both of pleasure and pain, is worth having. 
Thns the appeal to anthority completely breaks down, a single recnsant being 
enough to invalidate it." 

Passing over the question whether any such recusant exists, 
it may be as well, before admitting the alleged break-down, 
to ask what is the meaning of the word " worth," as used in the 
above relation. There presents itself the problem to define 
" worth " in terms which exclude all reference, direct or indirect, 
to satisfaction, or pleasure, or gratification. It is required to 
find a case in which men, or things, or acts, are contrasted as 
having worth and as being worthless, without there entering the 
conception of preference ; or if the conception of preference enters, 
then it is required to state what kind of preference it is which 
takes place between things of which one is not liked more than 
the other; or if difference of liking is admitted, then the 
question to be answered is what kind of liking is it which does 
not connote pleasure. Similarly with the words used in a sen- 
tence which shortly follows : — 

** For the question is not whether pleasure is- a good and pain an evil, but 
whether pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil." 

Which question at once raises the inquiry for the kind of evil 
which, neither proximately nor remotely, to the actor or to any 
other being, now or hereafter, produces any pain. Until some 
such kind of evil has been pointed out, I do not see any proposi- 
tion against which I have to contend. There is merely the 
alleged possibility of a proposition. 

As already hinted, I cannot follow further the course of Mr. 
Bonn's argument, but must leave its validity to be judged by 
that of this first portion. The only remark I will add, concerns, 
not a matter of argument but a matter of evidence. B/cferring 
to my account of the origin of the religious sanction, Mr. Benn

says : — " It seems a pity to disturb sucli an ingenious and sym- 
metrical theory, but I am not aware that it is supported by any 
external evidence, while there are strong reasons for dissenting 
from it." Does Mr. Benn mean that no such external evidence 
is contained in the Data of Ethics f 11 he does, then the reply 
is that such evidence, occupying more space than that afforded 
by the entire volume, would have rather too much interrupted 
the thread of the argument. Does he mean that I have not 
given such external evidence elsewhere ? Then the reply is 
that in the first division of the Frinciples of Sociology, evidence 
so great in quantity is set forth, that I have been blamed for 
over-burdening my argument with it ; and a further reply is that 
if Mr. Benn wishes for still more such evidence, he will find 
abundance of it in Nos. II., III., IV., V. and VI. of the Descrip- 
tive Sociology, where the religious ideas of some eighty un- 
civilized and semi-civilized peoples are described in detail. In 
disproof of my view concerning the genesis of the political and 
religious controls, Mr. Benn goes on to say : — " Modem inquiries 
into the history of jural conceptions show that among primitive 
men kings were not legislators but judges," and by way of 
showing what happens among "primitive men" he instances 
" the original judgments or Themistes " of the Greeks. On this 
my comment is that Mr. Benn seems unacquainted with 
inquiries, more " modem " than those he refers to, which show 
that theories about primitive ideas and institutions, based on 
facts furnished by historic peoples, are utterly misleading. The 
origins of religious and jural conceptions and usages, Mr. Benn 
thinks may fitly be sought in the traditions of the early Greek 
world; though, as Curtius remarks (Bk. I. 136-?), this "is 
not ... a world of beginnings ; it is no world still engaged 
in an uncertain development, but one thoroughly complete, 
matured and defined by fixed rules and orders of life." For 
myself, in seeking for origins, I prefer to look for them among 
peoples who have not yet arrived at a stage in which there are 
metal weapons and metal armour, two-horse war-chariots, 
walled towns, temples> palaces, and sea-going ships. 

I had orginally intended to notice briefly, certain other criti- 
cisms — one by Prof. Calderwood, which formed the inaugural 
lecture to his class at Edinburgh in the session of 1879, and was 
afterwards published in the Contemporary Eeview ; and the 
other by Prof. Wace of King's College, which was first addressed 
to the Victoria Institute, and also afterwards published in the 
Contemporary Eeview. But I have already occupied as many 
pages of Mind as I can reasonably ask for ; and, further, I can- 
not longer suspend more important work for which my time and

energies are already insiifficient. Replying to criticisms is, 
indeed, a bootless undertaking, save in those cases where the 
positions defended are further elucidated, and so rendered more 
acceptable to those who are not committed to antagonist views. 
On such as are committed to antagonist views, repHes, however 
conclusive, produce no appreciable effects; and especially is 
this so when such antagonist views are involved in tiieological 
problems*
