S for the not yet communicated Tryals that I made in 
profecuting my Defign of difcovering or obferving 
fome latent Qualities of theAir, I will not deny you fome of them, 
as imperfect as they yetare, but will venture to fend them you , as 
my Notes or my Memory fuggefts them to me ; not only, becaufe 
without being ccmpleated ihey may be fit enough to countenance

fufpicittu (for you know,that I do not call them fo much as ■opinions,') 
but for a weightier inducement, to be told you at the end of this 
Paper. , 

The two chief things aimed at in-the imperfect Attempts I now 
fend you, were to difcover ; firji, whether, as fome Corrofionsof 
Eodies do in clofe VefTels increafe the Spring of the Air ( as I long 
fince noted them to do,) fo fome other Corrofions may not, by a 
contrary or fome othemvay, weaken the Spring of the Air ; and 
next, whether in fome Solutions and Precipitations the Air on the 
account of fome unobfervcd Quality may not be found to produce 
fome Phxwmeni not yet taken notice of. 

In order to each of thefe Enquiries,I fliall mention a few Tryals, 
though without curioufly for ting them, becaufe fometimes in the 
fame EXperitnentboth thofe Attempts were jointly profecuted. 

You may remember that in fome of my formerly publifhed Try- 
als I acquainted you with an odd Phenomenon of the Ch&nge of Co- 
lor producible in foltitions of Copper by the operation of the Air; 
I fliall now add what further Tbanomem my Memory or Notes fup- 
ply me with,about the SubjecVof that and the like Experiments. 

Experiment th'e Firji. 

We took filings of crude Copper, and put them intoaCryftal- 
linGlafi of a Conical fhape, into which we poured fome ftrong 
Spirit of Salt, (that was fitted for our peculiar purpofe) to the 
Jheighthof about a fingers breadth above the Filings ; and then clo- 
fing the Veflel withaGlafs-ftopple exquifirly fitted to it, we fuf- 
fer'd it to continue unmoved in a Window for fjme dayes, till the 
liquor had both obtained a high and darkifh brown colour by the 
folutionof fome of the Copper, and loft that colour again, grow- 
ing clear like common water, (which is it felf a fomewhat odd Phe- 
nomenon;) and then taking out the ftopp'e, (without fhaking the 
liquor)and thereby giving accefs to the outward Air, we percei- 
ved, (as we had conjeflur'd) that the upper furface of the liquor 
did in a few minutes re-acquire a darkifh brown colour, which pe- 
netrating deeper and deeper, at the end of about a quarter of an 
hour the whole body of the liquor appeared to be lifcewife tinged. 
The Conical Glafs being again well ftopt,theM<f»j?r«»»» did again 
in very few dales let fail or otherwife !ofe its tincture ; which, the 
ftopple being taken oat, it re-gained as before. Nor were thefe 
two the only Tryals I made with the like fuccefs for the main ; but 

after- 



C 469 ) 

aftervvards being defirous by a further Trya! to refolve a doubt I 
had, 1 kept the Glafsyet longer in the fame place with the fame 
Filings and tMcn^rmm in it for (if I mif-remember not) a moneth 
or two together ; but obferved not,that the liquor would any mere 
grow clear. 

Experiment the Second. 

Having taken fuch aGJafs,as is mention'd in Experiment thefrjl, 
wherein the liquor was grown clearer than is ufual, and had pro- 
bably been To a good while before, (for the VefTel, having been hid 
by others which flood before it, had been for fome weeks forgot- 
tenO We took out the ftoppleand left it opan for about half an 
hour , but did not perceive the liquor to have acquired any colour 
ib much as at the top. Whether this proceeded from the long de- 
barring of commerce with the frefh Air, or from fome other caufe, 
being unable to wait the event *s long as would perhaps be requi- 
fite, I thought fit to try, Whether the Air had already had fome o- 
peration upon the liquor, (hough it did not yet appear; and ac- 
cordingly putting in the ftopple, Iltft theVeflTel clofed for two 
or three hours, and at my return to vifit it, I perceived,that it had 
acquired a faint colour tending to a green ; wherefore taking out 
the ftopple again, J open'd its Commerce with the outward Air , 
leaving theGlafs unftopt for 20 or 24 hours, but found, that in all 
that time it had not re-gained its wonted dark colour,but was only 
arrived at a green, deep enough , but not true nor very tranfpa- 
rent. 

This Obfervation being made in the fame VefTel that had been 
formerly employed, fuggefted to us an Enquiry , Whether the ad- 
vanced time of the year, which was the middle of October , might 
not have an intereft in the flow and imperfeft fuccefs of this TryaL 
Experiment the Third. 

Some ftrong Spirit of Salt having been kept upon Filings of Cop- 
per till the folutioh was come to be of a dark brown colour,about 
three fpoonfuls of it by guefs was put into a Receiver that might 
hold eight or ten times as much : Being kept in vacuo ( if the time 
be rightly remember'd) about half a year, it rctain'd its colour, 
but the VefTel being open'd and the External Air permitted a free 
accefs to it, the fo'ution in about an hour was turn'd into a fine 
transparent green,though no Precipitation of any muddy fubftance 
appeared by any Sedimeftt to be made.

Experiment tkk Fourth. 
Tri one of that fore of Conical Glafles that has been already more 
than once defcrib'cl, we had put' upon forae Filings of Copper a 
convenient quantity of our Spirit of Salt ; and though we obferv'd, 
that for a great while it would not part with its deep and fomewhat 
muddy tintture 5 yet we left it in the window for many weeks 
longer,andat length,towards the latter end of December, we found 
it to have loft its tinfture, fo much that the liquor appear'd like 
common water. Upon which obfervation, though the time of the 
year were unpromifing, I thought fit to try , whether the Air in 
that Ceafon would not have fome, though perhaps but a flow, ope- 
ration on the Saline Spirit, and accordingly taking otit the Glafs- 
ftojpple to give freeaccefs to the outward Air-, we obferv'd, that 
in feme hours its operation on the liquor was fcaree fenfible , but 
within about 24 hours the Menftrmm had acquired not juft its for- 
mer colour, but a fonaewhat faint and moderately tranfparent 
green : So that this tin&ed Menftruim,** it had been very flow in 
lofing its colour, foic, did but flow-ly and imperfcGly reacquire 
it. 

I Have not in the foregoing Experiments made mention of any I>h<e* 
nomena of them relating to the Spring of the included Air, be- 
caufe I do not remember, that they were fuck ,is invited me to draw any 
pofithe Conclujion from them, andmy filence on this occajion tmty he 
the more Allowable, because the way of farther making fuch Obfet vali- 
ent maybe Efficiently dedue'd from the infuing Trials ; in reciting of 
which I alter very little, and in fome of them not at all, the expressi- 
ons \ find them regifter din, though more than once the Phenomena 
tha t relate to the Air's Elaflie power be mingled in the fame Experi- 
ment with the mention of its operations uponColoms, 

'J he Spring of the Air and its variations, by the wayes now kmwn 
to many of the Curious, being things that mamfeflly appear to have a 
notable inter eft in divers Phenomena ofXature, whofe Caufes, if not 
thcmfelvts alfi, were unknown to former Philofophors ; it feem'd an 
Attempt, though not very promifing , yet worth the making , to try 
whether the Spring of the Air, which may clivers wayes, ashy Heat, 
Compreffion, ej-c. be increased, may not by fome other way than Cold 
and Dilatation be weaken d: And having often found <zJMenftruurns 
tha! corrode Metals, fo as to produce bubbles to invigorate the [Irtngth 



C 471 > 

«f the Spring of the Air included in the Veftels, wherein thefolutkn 
was made, I thought Jit to try, whether infome metalline Dijfolutionj, 
wherein I had observed that few or no vifible bubbles at all were pro ■ 
duced, the Spring^/ the neighbouring and included Air would net be 
debilitated j and in order tot hi} were made the following try ah.

Experiment the Fifth.

with a Mercurial gage * in a Conical 



Glafs fitted with an exaftly ground ftopple of ^~£ ,„,»

(Vim an inch or better above them j then care- 
fully flopping the Glafs, coming to look on it many hours after,\ve 
perceived that the Mercury in the feaPdleg was confiderably de- 
preft, and gently drawing out the ftopple to let in the outwaid 
Air, we perceived that accefs to have a manifeft effect upon the 
Mercury*] 

But this will be better understood by the more Circumftantial 
Experiment that infues. 

Experiment the Sixth. 

[We took a Cryftal Glafs of an almoft Conical fiiape, andcapa* 
bleof containing bet ween five and fix ounces of water, and lur- 
nifhed with a ftopple of the fame matter, that by grinding was 
exactly fitted to it. Into this we put a convenient quantity of 
clean Filings of good Copper, on which wc poured as much 
ftrong Spirit of (fermented, or rather) putrifi'd Urin, as ferved to 
fwim about ah inch above the Copper, and having letdown a 
Mercurial g3ge, Co that it leaned upon the 
bottom and fide of the Glafs, we clofed it very g^J^f/i^ 
well with a ftopple, and fet it in a quiet and 
well enlighten'd place, having taken good notice at what mark 
the Quickfilver refted in the open leg of the Gage. This done, we 
let the Menflrmm alone to work upon the Filings? which it did, 
asweforefaw, fame what flowly and very calmly without produ- 
cingany noife or fenfible bubbles, acquiring by degrees a very 
pieafant blew colour, and the Glafs being kept quiet in the fame 
place for two or three daieslonger , the liquor, as I conjeclur'd 

' WOlild 



( 472 ) 
would happen, began to lofe of the intenfnefs of its colour, whicis 
by degrees grew fainter and fainter, till at the end of three or four 
daies the liquor was grown very pa'e, and left pie little doubt but 
that, if I would have ftaidfome daies longer, it would have loft 
the remaining Eye of blew, and have lookt almoft like common 
water. But being unwilling to tarry fo long, I took out the 
ilopple, that the Air w//;kw/ the Glafs might have accefs to that 
within ; and leaving the Vial in the fame place and pofture,my ex- 
pectation was fomewhat anfwer'd by finding, that within four or 
five minutes, if not lefs, the upper part of the liquor , that was 
contiguous to the Air, had acquired a fine blew colour, which de- 
fcending deeper and deeper, before the end of the tenth minute 
had diffufed it felf, but fomewhat weaken'd, through the liquor, 
whofe colour was fuffer'd to deepen for a while longer ; fo that in 
lefs than a quarter of an hour from thefirft unftopping of the Vial, 
the liquor was grown to be throughout of a rich Ceruleous colour, 
which grew almoft too opacous within a few minutes longer: When 
carefully doling the Vial again with the fame ftopple as before.we 
fet it afide in the fame place , where, the included Air being deni- 
ed all Commerce with the External, the liquor began again within 
two or three daies to lofe of its colour ; and, to be fhorr, afforded 
me the opportunity of making afecwd Experiment, much like the 
former. And the like fuccefs I had, for the main, in a Tryal or 
twomadeinanotherGlafs with another portion of the fame Spi- 
rit of Urin, put upon the Filings of Copper j fo that the Expe- 
riment was, in all, made divers times, as well when I was not, as 
when I was alone : And particularly, once to be fure that the di- 
urnal Air as fuch had not any great intereft in the Phtnomenm ; I 
made the Tryal fuccefsfully about Nine a clock at night in the pre- 
fence of fo well-known a Wifnefs a"s the Learned Secretary of the 
Royal Society. 

One Circumftance I forgot to take notice of, which was, that 
in mod of thefe Experiments I forbore to (hake the Glafs, left 
it fhou'd be fufpefied, that the Agitation of the liquor might have 
raifedfome little fine powder that might have been fuppofed to 
have been precipitated out of the tinflure, and, being thus ming- 
led with the liquor again, reftore it to its former colour $ but in 
truth I did not perceive any fuch powder to be precipitated. And 
though, to obviate the objection, I forbore to fhake the Vial ; 

yet 



( 475 ) 
yet I juftly fuppofed, that if> by the agitation of the liquor, 
morepa«*of it fliould be quickly expofed to the adionof the 
Air, the Coloratiou would be haften'd, which upon tryal appear'd 
tobe true.] 

Experiment the Seventh. 

[Experience having made me think it likely, that ftrong Spirit of 
Sal Armoniac, made without Quick-lime , would operate more 
nimbly and more powerfully on that metal than our Spirit of Urin 
had done; we took fuch a Conical Glafs, as has been lately de- 
fcribed , and covering the bottom of it with a convenient quanti- 
ty of Filings of good Copper, we poured on them as much firong 
Spirit of SdArmonm as ferved tofwim about a fingers breadth 
above them ; and,having let down fuch a Mercurial Gage as is for- 
merly mention'd, fo that it leaned upon the bottom and fide of the 
Glafs, we clofed it very well with a ftopple and let it in a quiet 
and well enlighten'd place, having taken good notice at what mark 
the Quickfilver refted intheopenlegof theGage; Thisdone,we 
let the Menftrttitm alone to work upon the Filings, which it did, 
asweforefaw, forr.ewhat flowly and very calmly, without pro- 
ducing any noife or fenfible bubbles, acquiring by degrees a very 
pleafant blew colour, and afforded us a!fo the Phenomenon we 
chiefly lookt after 5 which was, that repairing from time to time 
to the window to fee what pall, we perceived, that for two or 
three daies together the Mercury in the feal'd leg of the Cage did, 
though very flowly, defcend till it appear'd to be near a quarter 
of an inch lower than at firfr ; and probably the deprefiion mighc 
have been greater, if fome indifcreet body or other had not, by 
tampering with the Glafs, disturbed the Experiment* whofe e» 
vent yet feemed fufificiently toargue, that the Spring of the Air , 
contained in the cavity of the Glafs, and communicating with that 
in the open leg of the Gage or Syphon, was weaken'd in comparifon 
of that in theclofed leg, which by the Hermetic Seal on one fide, 
and the Quickfilver on the other fide, was kept from fuch Commu= 
nication. 

And becaufe I thought, it might be fufpected, that the Phsnc- 
menon might be referrable to fome Inequality in the preflure of 
the Air, occafioned by the greater operation of the heat of the 
day on the more imprifon'd Air of the Gage, than on that more 
immediately included in the cavity of the Vial; I was careful to 

obferys 



C 474 ) 

obferve, whether the Depreflion did not continue at differing 
times of the day, and found it to do fo, as well at night as at 
noon, though at this laft: named time the Sun fliincd hot upon the 
place and VeflTels too. 

This Experiment was made, in all, four or five times,though not 
alwaies with equal, yet ftiH with fome, fuccefs, the Mercury in 
the feal'd leg of the Cage being fometimes more and fometimes lefs, 
but alwaies manifestly depreft ; which Phenomenon was confirm- 
ed by the Obfervation we more than once made of the fudden re- 
curnof the Quickfilver to it former /larion, upon the unflopping 
of the Glafs, to give free admifllon to the outward Air. 
Experiment the Eighth^ 

Confidcring,whih'n was about thefc Tryals, that Spirit of Vi- 
negar, though in working upon Coral and fome other Bodies it 
not only produces ftore of bubbles, but a'fo, as I have elfewhere 

deliver'd *,a fomewhat odd kind of Ela-

of the Gage three marks or Divifions, 'which Igueffed toamount roaboutthe third 
partof the extent it had before.- But fome hours after the Cor rofioB had ceafed, 
the Comprcffi >n made by this newly generated Air grew manifeAly fainter, and 
the imprifon'd Gage-Air drove down the Mercury again 'till 'twas depreft within 
ontdivifionof itsfirft ftariun; and thereabouts, or iittle lower, continued five 
or fixdsyev, fo that in this operation there feemed to have been a double Coin-

[ A pretty quantity of Spirit of Vinegar being put upon Mi- 
nium in a Conical Glafs, furniflied with a Glafs ftopple and a Mer- 
ciwrial Gage, continued divers dayes without any fenfible Depref- 
fionof the Mercury in either leg, nor did any change appear in 

the 



( 47$ ) 
the Gage, upon the removal of the ftopple, though 'twas evident 
by the great fweetnefs acquired, that it had made a Solution of a 
great portion of the Minium.'} 

But U return to our Trysts upon Coffer $ 

Experiment the Ninth. 

[We took fome Filings of Copper, and in a Vial capab!e of 
holding fome two or three Ounces of Water, we poured on them 
ftrong Spirit of Sal Jrmoniae made without Quicklime, till the 
liquor reached near an Inch above, them* This was done about 
the twentieth of Augufi on the Friday before Noon , and the fol- 
lowing Munday presently after Dinner it had acquired a deep Blew 
tinfture, and loft again fo much of it, that 'twas pale almoft like 
common water: Then to fatisfie a Virtuoft, IunftopttheVial,de- 
Gring him to place his eye level with the furface of the liquor, 
which in aminute of an hour or Iefs appeared, to hisfurprize and 
wonder, to have acquired a deep Blew tin&ure, that reached 
downwards to the thicknefs of the back of a knife, the whole 
liquOr becoming of the like Colour in four or five minutes more , 
and the Glafs being prefently ftopt again , and left where 'twas 
before, appeared not at the end of nine daies to have loft its tin- 
fture; though now and then within that time it feemed manifeftly 
paler than when the Vial was ftopt] 



NOne of the firmer Tryals with Spirit of Sal Armonm having 
been made in an Hermetically fealed Glafs, it will not he amifs 
both to diverfijie and to eonjirm our Experiments, by jetting down the 
fuccefs of one made in fucb a Veffel: 

Experimtnt the Tenth. 

[We took a round Vial holding about eight Ounces of water, 
ana 7 having pat into it Filings of Copper and a Mercurial Gage,we 
poured on the Metal ftrong Spirit of Sal Armoniac, till it reach- 
ed to a good height in the Vial, which then being Hermetically 
fealed up, wasfetby in a South- window , where it quickly ac* 

Q^q q quired 



( 47* ) 
quired a deep Blew tinflure; There it flood about twelve dates,, 
before that tin&ure, which decayed but flowly, did little by 
little grow To diluted that the liquor was pale and almoft like wa- 
ter : During this flayof the Glafs in the window, the Mercury 
in theopen leg appeared to be impeli'dup, and when after nine 
a clock at night, (which time I chofe to try whether the Nofturnal 
Air, as Nocturnal, would have any thing to do with the Phenome- 
non,) the Hermetic Seal was broken off; immediately upon which 
there was produced a noife , and the Mercury in the fhorter and 
clofed leg was briskly impel Pd up, by our guefs, near three eights 
of an Inch, and though the Orifice at which the Air had accefs was 
fcarce wide enough to admit a middle feized pea, yet within a 
minute and half the furface of the liquor being held between the 
Eye and the Candle, appeared to have acquired a very lovely and 
fair Colour, which reached downwards a quarter of an Inch; fo 
that the Vial feemed to contain two very differing liquors fwim- 
ming on one another , and the Coloration piercing deeper and 
deeper within five Minutes in all, the whole liquor had attained a 
rich Blew colour,] 

With this Experiment lfhall conclude this Taper : For, though I 
made fever al other tryals , with the (ame defgn that I made the 
foregoing ones, as with Spirit of Niter, ^Minium, Spirit of Vi- 
negar and Copper ;yet a prefent want of time hinders me from trcub- 
ling you with them, which Ithe rather forbear to do, becaufe I fear, 
they would prove lefs ftitisfaciory than tho/e I have fet down ; which 
themfelves mufi, to a lefs discerning eye than yours, appear very im- 
perfect, notwithflanding that prolixity in reciting fome of them; 
which I was obliged to by my not yet knowing, in fuch odd attempts, 
what Circumjlances might fafely be omitted. But fuch as they are I 
fendthemyou, who by your diffufed Correfpondency have great opportu- 
nity to get them made, if you think them worth it, by Cur torn persons 
in fever al Countries, various manners, and differing feafom of the 
Tsar: And ) however the things! fend you be but trifles, yet their 
Novelty may perhaps excite the Indufry of others, and give ri r e t( 
further Inquiries.
