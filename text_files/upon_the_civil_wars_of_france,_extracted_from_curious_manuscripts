famous Prince of Conde, Brother to Anr*

Year of his own. ' . 

The Mother of Henry was 'Jeanne itAl" 
hrety Daughter to Henry d^Alhret, King (3t 
Navarre j a good Man, and a worthlefs 
Prince, rather flothful than peaceable^; who

This Prince, who lived in a time of

Cauie of his Euemies againft the Intereft 
of his own Houfe i and be died, as he had 
livedo uncertain and anxbus. 

Jeanne d'Alhet was quite of an oppo- 
fite Temper, fiUI of Courage and Refolu- 
tion, feared by the Court of France^ beloved 
by the Jproteftants, eft^emed by both. She 
knew all the fuperior pares of Policy, buc 
ijever the mean Craft of Intrigue. It isi 
very remarkable, that ftie turned Prote^ 
ftant at the very time her Husband turned 
Catholick > but from that day Ihe was as 
firmly attached ta her new Religion, asi 
. Anthony was wavering in his. By thefe 
means flie became the Head of one Party,; 
^ whilft her Husband was the Slave and 
Bubble of the other. 

She took the Education of her Sqn en^ 
tirely into her own hands. Hemy was 
born with all the Endowments of his Mo-, 
ther, and he improved *em enjiqently ]^f- 
terwards. He had nothing of his l^atber^

in Anthony was Uncertainty and Weaknpfs,

young Companions of his Age, climbed 
tip with them among Rocks and Woods 
to the Tops of the neighbouring Moun- . i 
tains, according to the Cuftom of that 
Country, and of thofe Times. 

Whili he was thus bred up With his 
Subje£ts in a fort of Equality, without 
which a Prince is too apt to forget ne is 
bom a Man; Fortune opened in France 
a bloody Scene, and through th^ Ruins of 
that Kingdom almoft overturned, and over 
the Graves of many Princes untimely cut 
off, prepared him a way to a Throne, 
which he was in time to conquer, and to 
reftore to its Grandeur. 

Henry the Second, King of France, the ^ 
Head of the Branch of Valois, was killed 
at Paris, in a Tournament, which was the 
laft in Europe of thefe romantick and dan- 
gerous Sports. 

He leff four Sons, Francis the Second, 
Charles xht Ninth, Henry the Third, and 
the Duke d^Alenpn ; all the unworthy Po- 
feerity of the great Francis the Firft, all 
(except Aknfun) afcended the Throne one 
after another ; all lived Ibamefully, died; 
untimely, and without Iffue.

He was married to that famous and 
unfortunate Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland^ 
whom her Beauty and Weakncfs led after- 
wards into great Faults, greater Miferies, 
and at laft to a dreadful Death. She go« . j^

without Virtue, bom with an infirm Body, ^ 

and a weak Mind. \ 

Incapable of Governing by her fclf,

Guife, her Mother's Brother; he influ- 
enced the King by her means, and laid 
deep the Foundations of the Grandeur 
of his own Houfe* Catherine di Medicis, .Z 

the late King's Widow, and the prefeht 
King's Mother, began now to ihew the

Matters of the Court, were \>y cburfc 
Mafl^rs oiF the Kingdom ;, the one in 
Prance being generally a neceffary Coirfe- 
quence of the other. 

The Houfe of Bourbon wa^ groaniap 
under the Oppreffion of the Houfe fi£ 
Lorrnin • Anttmy of Navarre bore pa- 
tiently many tcandalous Affrcmts ; thr 
Prince of Conde^ his Brother, ftill moM 
bitterly abufed, endeavoured to ftakc oSL 
the Yoke. He iraited in his great De*' 
figns with the Admiral Go%«y, the Heajd 
of the Hou<e of ChatiUon : Thefe tlvo 
Men were the moft terrible Enemies that 
the Court bad to fear ; Conde more ambi- 
tious, mgre forward, more jwftlefs ; Oh 
ligny of a more fedate Temper, Six^tlb 
in his Beliaviour, fitter to be the Head 
of a Party, indeed as unfuccefsful in War 
as Conde^ but repairing often by his Wif- 
dom what fcem d irrepairable, more dan- 
gerous after a Defeat, than his Enemies 
after a Viftorj' ; endowed befides with as 
great a (bare of Virtue as thofe Tim^ 
could permit, and as the Spirit of Fadioa 
could allow. 

The, Proteftants began then to grow 
i\umerous, and to be confcious of their 
Strength;' - \

Knavery of the Monks, the over^grbwn 
Power of Rome, Men's Paflion for No^

^Ity, the Ambition of Luther and Cal^ 
'viriy the PoJicy of many Princes j all thefo 
had given rife and countenance to this 
Se£l, free indeed from Superftition, but 
running as headlong towards Anarchy, as 
the Church of.Rowe towards Tyranny. 
The Proteftants had been unmercifully 
perfecuted in Prance ; but it is the orj^i- 
pary cffeft of Perfecution to make Pro- 
felytes ; their 8e6t increafed every day 
amidft the Scaflfolds and Tortures, .ponde^ 
Qdigtiy^ th« two Brothers of Coligny^ all 
their Adherents, all who were oppreffed 
ipy the GuifeSj turned Proteftants aiJ once ; 
they united their Griefs, their Vengeance, 
and their Interelts together, fo that a Re- 
volution both in the State and in Religion 
was at hand. ^- ^ 

The firft Enterprize was'^a Plot- to feizc 
the Guifes at Amhife^ and to get the Per- 
fon of the King into their hands : The 
Plot boldly contrived, fecretly carried on, 
w^ difcoyercd jull as it was ready to be 
ipUt in execution ; the Guifes putjiflied the 
Copfpirators in the moft cruel n\anner, 
in order to terrify their Enemies from 
the like Attempts hereafter; more thj^n 
feven hundred Proteftants were executed 
CmcU was made Prifoner, impeached of 
High Tieafon, tried, and fentenced to 
death.

Daring liis Trial, King Anthony of 
Navarre, his Brother, ftirred up by his 
Wife, and by the Colignys, raifed in Gfui" 
enne a powerful Number of Gentlemen, 
as well Proceftants as Catholicks, attached 
to his Houfe : he went with this Army 
through Gafcogne ; but upon a fingle Met 
fagechat he received in his way from the 
Court, he difmifled them all with Tears ; 
/ muftfubmit, fays he, but t will obtain ytmr 
pardon from the King. Go, and ask pardm 
for yoa,fc^f^ virfwered an old Officer, our 
Security is in the Point of our Swords, 
Whtrenpon the Nobility, who followed 
him, returned ^ome with Scorn and In- 
dignation: Anthony purfued his Journey 
to the Court; there he follicited for th6 
Life of his Brother, being not fecure of 
his own'; and helntreated everyday the 
Duke and the Cardinal of Gui/e^ who 
received him fitting with their Caps on, 
whilft he was bare-headed and ftanding. 

Every thing was now ready for the 
Death of the Prince of Conde, when ou 
a fudden the King fell fick and died. The 
Circumftances, the Suddcnnefs of this 
Accident, the Propenfity of Mankind to 
believe that the untimely Deaths of •Princes 
are never natural, gave courfe to the ge- 
neral Opinion, that Francis the Second had 
been poifoned.

His Death gave a new turn fo Af- 
fairs : the Prince of Cmde was fist ap li- 
beny, his Party began to breathe, his Re-- 
ligion was propagatcfd more and more^ 
the Authority of the Guifes declined, 
tho* not pulled down : 4nthony of Nor^ 
^arre recovered, a Shadow of Authority, 
which was enough for him ; Mary Smart 
was fent away into Scotland i and Catherine 
de Medici s^ who now began to aA the 
nrft part on tho Stage, Vas declared Re- 
gent of the Kingdom during the Minority 
of Charles the Ninth her fecond Son. 

She found herfelf intangled in a Laby 
rinth of inextricable Difficulties, between 
two Religions^ and ieveral FaAions firue« 
Un^ with each other, and contending tor 
the Power.

Clb^irch of Rome and that of Geneva, jea-*

The iSuifef, who were zealous Catho- 
licks, beddife Conde and Coligny were 
Proteftants, were a long while at the 
head of the C^tholick Troops : Many 
Battlts were fought, the Kingdom was

Civil War, accepted of it eagerly ; Charles^ 
in order to leave no room for any Sufpi-

The King's Palace was one of the 
chief Theatres of Murder, for the Prince 
Henry of Navarre had his Lodgings in 
the Louvre, and all his Domefticks were 
Proteftants ; many of them were kiUed 
in their Beds with their Wives; others 
were flying naked, ^ and purfued by the 
$oldierson the Stair-*Caie$, through all 
the Rooms, of the Palace, nay even to 
the King's Antichamber. The young 
Wife oiMemy q£ Navarre, awakened, by 
the dreadful Uproar» fearing for her tixn^

much in the King's favour, for his comely 
Air, his Honefty, and a certain peculiar 
Happinefs in the Turn of his Converfation. 

Twas the Earl of la Rcchefoucauk^

Murderers fell upon all three promifcu- 
oufly, and ftruck them at random ; the 
Father and the Sons, covered with Blood, 
fell and lay upon one another. The 
youngeft received not one Blow, coun^ 
terfeited to be dead, and made his efcape 
the next day ; his Life fo wonderfully 
preferved, lafted Fourfcore and Five Years. 
He was the fame famous Marfhal de la 
Force, Uncle to the Dutchefs otla Force 
who is now in England. 

Mean while many of thofe miferable 
Viftims fled to the River-fide ; fome were 
fwimming over to the Fauxbourg St. Ger-^ 
mahu The King ikw them from his Win- 
dow, which look'd upon the River, and 
(what is almoft incredible, but too true) he 
hred upon them with a Carbine. Catherim 
de Medicfs, undifturbed and ferene in 
the midft of the Slaughlter, look'd down 
from a Balcony fituated towards the City, 
encouraged the Aflfaffins, and laugh'd at 
the dying Groans of the Murdered ; her 
Maids ol Honour and fome Ladies of 
the Court went down into the Street, and 
with an impudest Curiofity, tallying 
with the Abominations of that Age, ob^ 
ferved the naked Body of one Sm^bife^ who 
bad been fifpe£^ed of ImpotenqVi Md 
was juft then killed under the Queen'< 
Windows.

The Court reeking with the Blood of 
the Nation, tryed fomc Days after to pal- 
liate fuch a Crime with Forms of 
Law. They juftified the Maflacres 
with a Calumny ,• they imputed to the 
Admiral, a Confpiracy which no body 
believed. The Parliament was ordered 
to proceed againft the Memory of Colig- 
ny, his dead Body was hanged in Chains 
at the Gallows of Montfaucon. The King 
himfelf went to fee that loathfome Spefta- 
cle, and as one of his Courtiers advifed 
him to retire, and complain'd of the 
ftench of the Corps, the King anfwered, 
A dead Enemy fineOs fweet. 

That the Head of the Admiral was 
fent afterwards to the Pope, is a Thing 
which cannot be proved; Certain it is, that 
the Ma{facres of St. Bartholomews Day are 
painted at Rome in the Royal Hall of the 
Vatioan^ with thefe Words under the 
Pifturc, Pontifex Colignii necem probat. 

Young Henry of Navarre was fpared 
rather by the. Policy than by the Pity of 
Catherine y wHo detained him a Prifoner,,

him a Security and a Pledge for the fub- 
mifllon of the Proteftants who fliould ef-

perhaps her Death was natural, ^twas not 
a rafti Opinion to believe her to have been 

poifou'd. 

However, the Execution was not con- 
fined alone to the City of Paris, the fame t 
Orders were fent from the Court to the 
Governors of /all the Provinces of France ; 
fo that in a Week's time, more than a 
hundred thoufand Proteltants were mafla- 
cred all over the Kingdom. 

Two or three Governors *cnly refuted 
to comply with the King's Orders ; one 
among others, called MommoYrin, Gover- 
nor of Auvergne, wrote to the King the 
following Letter, which delerve$ to be 
tranfmitced to Pofterity : 

Sir * 

*' I have received an Order under your 

" Majefty's Seal to put to death all the 

•' Proteftants in my Province. I have too 

'' much Refpeft for your Majefty not to

yours, I have too much Refpeft for your 
" Majefty to obey it."

teftants who efcaped. Rage inftead ot 
Terror ; their irreconcileable Hatred a-

Not long after, the King was taken 
with a ftrange Sicknefs, which carried 
him off in two Years. His Blood was 
daily ftealing out, and girfhing through • 
the Pores of his Skin : Such an unaccoun- 
table Diftemper, which was fo much a- 
bove the Knowledge and the Skill of Phy- 
ficians, was look'd upon as a Divine Ven- 
geance, as if the Blood of a Prince could 
attone for the Blood of fo mt ny thoufand 
innocent Men. 

During the Sicknefs of Charles^ his 
Brother Anjou had been elefted King of 
Poland^ on account of the great Reputa- 
tion which he had happily obtainM when 
he was a General, and which he loft when 
a King. 

As foon as he knew of his Brother's 
Death, he ftole away from Poland^ and 
ran into France^ to enjoy the dangerous 
Inheritance of a Kingdom (hattered by . 
Faftions, fatal to its Sovereigns, and 
ftained with the Blood of its Inhabitants. 
He found at his Arrival nothing but Par- 
ties and Calamities, which he increafed to 
the laft degree. 

Henry ^ then King of Navarre^ headed the 
Proteftants, and gave new Life to their 
Party. On the other fide, the young Duke 
of Guife began to dazzle the Eyes of the 
World with his great aiid dangerous 
Qualities ; he had a Gewuft mpre enter-^

prizing than his Father. He feemM bo- 
lides ;o have a fair Opportunity of aiming 
at that pitch of Grandeur to which his 
-Father had opened the way. 

Anjon^ now Henry the Third, was re- 
puted unable to get Children, becaufe of 
the Infirmities, v^hich the Debj^uches of 
his Youth had brought upon him. Henry 
of Navarre was the lawful Heir of the 
Crown. Guife tried to fecure it to him- 
ftlf, (at leaft after the Death of Henry 
the Third) and to wreft it from the Houfe 
of Capets^ as formerly the Capets had u- 
iurped it from the Defcendanrs of Charle- 
niagney and as the Father of Charkrna^ne 
from his lawful Sovereign. 

Never did fo bold an Undertaking feem 
fo well and £b happily laid. Henry pf 
Navarre^ and all the Houfe of Bourbon^ 
were Proteftants. Guife began to ingra- 
tiate himfelf with the Nation by the 
outward Shew of a Ca^fiolick Zeal. His 
Liberality lecured to him the common 
People, he had all the Clergy at his de- 
votion, Friends in the Parliament, Spies 
at Court, Servants throughout all the I 

Kingdom. His firft politick Step was to I 

make an Aflbciation under the NaAie of 
the Holy League^ againlt the Proteftants, 
for the Security of the Cathoiick Religion j ' 
iialf the Kingdom came with Eagernesft • 
into that new Project. Pope Sixtus Quintm 

bleffed . 






( 21 ) 

bleffed the League, and fupported it as a 
new Rontifh Militia. Philip the Second, 
King of Spaitty according to the Policy of 
all Sovereignis, who always help on the 
Ruin of their Neighbours, gave all forts 
of Encouragement to the League, in order 
to rend France to pieces, and enrich himfelf 
with its Spoils. 

Thus Henry being flill an Enemy to 
the , Proteftants, found liimfelf betrayed 
by the Cacholicks, furrounded with fe- 
cret and openyFoes, and overpowered by a 
Subjeft, who, tho* fubrniflive in appea- 
rance, was really more. King than him- 
felf. 

The only way perhaps to emerge from 
thefe Difficulties, was to join with Hen- 
ry of Navarre^ wbofe Fidelity, Courage, 
and indefatigable Spirit, was the only 
Match for Guifi^ arid Who could lecure to 
the King all th^ Proteftant Party, which 
would haVe thrown tiiuch Weight into 
the Ballance. "^ ^ . 

The King, ovfer-ruled by Guife (whom 
he diftrufted, but durft not provoke) ter- 
rified by ^he Pope, betrayed by his Coun- 
fellors, and by his Wrong Policy, took the 
contrary way. ti^ put himfelf at the head 
of the Holy League, in hopes to matter it ; 
he .united w:ith Gr/i/J', his R.^^ Subjcft, a- 
gainft his Succeflbr atid his Birother-^in-la w, 

B J * whom

whom Nature and true Policy pointed for 
his Ally. 

Henry of Navarre was now in Gafcogne 
at the head of a little Army, while a 
ftrong Body of Troops was coming to 
his Relief from the Proteftant Princes of 
Germany^ through the Borders oiLorrain. 

The King imagined that he could at 
once reduce t\ic Navarrois^ and fink Guife ; 
in order to that, he fent the latter with a 
fmall inconfiderable Army againft the 
Germans^ by whom he had like to have 
been overcome. 

At the fame time he caus'd his Favou- 
rite ^oyeufe to march againft the Navaf- 
rois^ with the Flower of the French No- 
bility, and with one of the ftrongeft Ar- 
mies that had appeared in the Field fince 
Francis the Firft. He was difappointed in 
all his Hopes ; Henry of Navarre defeated 
intirely at Coutras his powerful Army, and 
Guife got the better of the Germans. 

The only Ufe the Navahois made of 
his Vidory, was to o6fer a fure Peace to 
the Kingdom, and his Afliftance to the 
King ; but he was refusM, tho* Conque- 
ror, becaufe the King was ftiU more afraid 
of his Subjefts than of him. 

Guife returned viftorious to Paris, he 
was received like the Saviour of the Na- 
tion, his Party grew more audacious^ 
the King more defpis'd^ infomuch that 

Guife 



(25 ) 

Guife fcem^d to have triumphed over him 
more than over the Germans. 

The Kingjprefs'don every Side, awak'd 
from his Lethargy, but too late ; he try'd 
to humble the League, he defignM to 
feize fome of the moft feditious Ci- 
tizens, he had the Courage to forbid 
Guife to come to Paris ; but he felt at 
his own Expence what it is to command 
without Power. Guife came to Paris 
in defiance of his Orders, the Citi- 
zens rofeup in Arms, the King's Guards 
were taken Prifoners, and himfelf invef- 
ted in his Palace. Men are feldom good 
or bad enough* Had Guife attempted 
that Day againft the Liberty or the Life 
of the King, he had been in all likeli- 
hood Matter of France : but he let him 
efcape after having befiegM him ; and 
thus he did too much and too little. 

Henry the Third fled to Blots y where he 
held the General States cf the Kingdom. 

Thefe States refemble the Parliament 
of Great Britain in their Convocation, 
but are very different from it in their O- 
perations j as they are very feldom called, 
they hate no Rules to guide them, they 
are generally made up of Men who ne- 
ycr having been in any regular Meeting, 
know not how to behave themfelves^ and 
'tis rather a Confufion than an Affem- 

biy. 

B 4 Guife

(14) 

Guife did not ftick at going to Bhis td 
defy his Sovereign betore the Reprefcnta-^ 
tives of the Nation, after having expelled 
him from his Capital. 

Henry and he made a folemn Reconcilia- 
tion. They went together to the fame Al- 
tar, they received the Communion toge- 
ther,- the one fwore to forget all the paft 
Injuries, the other to be for ever true and 
obedient : And at that very time the King 
Intended to put Gtiife to death, and Guije 
to dethrone the King. 

Guife was fufficiently wam'd to beware 
oi Henry y but he defpis'd him fo much 
as not to think him bold enough, even 
to attempt an Aflaffination. This Ra(h- 
nefs betray'd him. The King was re- 
'lblv*d to be revenged on him, and upon 
hi^ Brother the Cardinal of Guife^ the 
Partner of his ambitious Defigns, and 
the moft ardent Promoter of the League. 
He provided Daggers himfelf, and diftri- 
buted them to fome Gafcoons^ who offered 
to be the Minifters of his Vengeance. They 
niurdered Guife in the King's Clofet ; but 
thefe very Men who ponyarded him re- 
fufed to imbrue their Hands in the Blood 
of his Brother, becaufc he was a Prieft 
and a Cardinal ; as if the Life of one who 
wears a Band and a Caflfock, were mor^ 
facred, than that of one who wears a fliort 
Veft and a Sword. 

The

The King niet with four common Sol- 
diers, who, as the Jefuit Maimhonrg fay^, 
having not fo much Honour as the aforc- 
faid Gentlemen, killed the Cardinal for 
an Hundred Crowns a-piece. 

The two Brothers were put to death 
under Catherine of Medicis* Apartment,- 
but flie was totally ignorant of her Son's 
Defign," being at that time diftrufted by 
all Parties, and fbrfaken even by the 
King. 

Had fuch a Vengeance been perpetra- 
ted with the Formalities of the Law, 
which are the natural Inftruments of 
the Juftice of Kings, or the natural Veil 
to their Iniquity, it had terrified the 
League; but as it wanted that folcmn 
Form, it was looked upon as a villanous 
Murder, and did but exafperate the Party. 
The Blood of the Guifes invigorated the 
Strength of the League, as the Death of 
Coligny had given a new Life to the Pro- 
teftants. Many Towns in France decla- 
red openly againft the King ; he went im- 
mediately to PariSy but he found the 
Gates (hut againft him, and all the City 
in Arms. 

The famous Duke of Mayenney younger 
Brother to the late Duke of Guije, was 
then in Paris. He was eclips*d by the 
Glory of Guife during his Life ; but af- 
ter his Death he provM as dangerous a 

Foe 



y 



(26) 

Foe as his Brother ; for all his Qualities 
were as great, tho* not fo (hining. 

The Houfe oi^ Lorraine was very nu- 
merous in Paris. The mighty Name of 
Guife, their Magnificence, their Libera- 
lity, their apparent Zeal for the Catho- 
lick Religion, had made them the Dar- 
lings of the City. Priefts, Burgeffes, 
Women, Magiftrates, Soldiers, all united 
vigoroufly with Mayenne in the purfuit 
of a Vengeance that was thought very 

The Duke s Widow prefented a Peti- 
tion to the Parliament againft Henry as a 
Murderer. The Tryal begun according 
to the common Form of Law> two Coun- 
fellors were appointed to draw up the 
Articles of Impeachment againft the King 5 
but the Parliament did not proceed fur- 
ther, the Heads of that Aflembly being 
firmly attached to the Royal Caufe. 

The Doftors o{Sor bonne were not fo cau- 
tious ; feventy of that Society iflued forth 
a Writ, by which Henry de Vahis was 
deprived of his Right to the Crown, 
and the Oaths of Allegiance w^re dif- 
folv'd. 

But the moft dangerous Enemies to the 
Royal Authority, were feme private Bur- 
geffes of PariSy called the Sixteen, not be^ 
caufe of their Number^ for they were for- 
ty i but from the Sixteen Wards of Paris 

which 



III II 11 - I IMBll' MBIBaMill 



which they had divided among them- 
felves to rule over. The moft conuderable 
of thefe Citizens, was one le Clerc^ who 
had aflfumed the great Name of Bufji. He 
was a bold Burgefs and a bad Soldier like 
his Affociates. Thefe Sixteen had got an 
abfolute Power, and grew at laft as infup- 
portable to the Duke of Mayenne hicifelf, 
as terrible to the King. 

Moreover, the Priefts, who have ever 
been the Trumpeters of all the Revolu- 
tions in the World, thundered in the 
Pulpit, and affured in the Name of God, 
that whofoever fliould attempt to kill the 
Tyrant, fliould go infallibly to Heaven. 
The facred and dangerous Nam^s of £- 
hud, of Judith, aud all the Afl'aifinations 
which the Holy Scripture hath confecra- 
ted, were then cryed out every where into 
the Ears of the Nation. 

The King in fuch an Extremity was 
forced at laft to call to his Aid the fam6 
Naruarrois, whofe Help he had refufed 
before. This Prince was better pleafed 
to fupport his Brother and his King, than 
to have vanquifli'd him. 

He brought his Army over to the 
King, but before his Troops were ar- 
riv a, he went forward to him, followed 
by a finglePage. The Ring was amazed 
at .fnch a piece of Generofity, which he 
had himfelf been uncapable q£ 

How-

(28) 

ilowevcr, the two Kings marched id 
Paris at the head of a powerful Army. 
The Town was not in a condition to refill. 
The League was upon the brink of Ruin^ 
when a young Fryar of thfc Order of 
St. Dominic, changed the whole face of 
Affairs. 

His Name was James Clement^ born in a 
Village of Burgundy called Sorbonne, and 
then four and twenty Years of Age. 
His furly Piety and melancholy Mind 
had been worked up to Enthufiafm by the 
common Cry of the Priefts : He took up^ 
on him to be the Deliverer and the Mar- 
tyr of the Holy League. He difeovered 
his Defign to his Friends, and to his Su-^ 
periors j all encouraged him, and made 
a Saint of him beforehand. Clement pre- 
pared himfelf for his Undertaking i he 
fafted, fpent whole Nights in Prayer, 
confefl'ed his Sins, received the Sacrament^ 
bought a good Dagger, and went away to 
St. Cloud, where the King had his Quarters. 
He asked for Admittance to the King, un- 
der pretence of revealing an important Se- 
cret, which could allow of no Delay. Be- 
ing brought before his Majefty, be kncel-^ 
ed down, and with a blufliing Modefty 
delivered into his hands a Letter, which he 
pretended was writ by the firft Prefident 
Achilles de Harlajf. As the King was per- 
ufing the Letter, the Fryar fUbb'd him 

in 






( 29 ) 

in the Belly, and left the Dagger flicking 
in the Wound ; then with an uncon-? 
cerned Look crofled his Hands over his 
Bre^ft, and lifted up his Eyes to Hea- 
ven, waiting for the Event without ftir- 
ring. 

The King cries out, rifes up, fnat- ' 
ches the Dagger ft'om his own Belly, 
and thrufls it into the Forehead of the 
Murderer. 

Maqy Courtiers; rufli in at the Noife, 
Jt had been their Duty to fecurc the 
Fryar, and referve him for Examinatioo 
and Torture, in order to a Difcovery of 
his Accomplices. But they killed him 
on the fpot with a precipitation that laid 
them under the fufpicion of having known 
too much of his Defign. 

Henry of Navarre was now King of 
prance by his Birthright, part of the Ar- 
my acknowledged him, and part forfook 
him. 

Duke dEpermn and fomc others retired, 
aUedging they were too good Catholicks, 
to fight for a King who did not go to 
Mafs. They fecrecly hoped that a total 
Subverfion of the Kingdom (which they 
wilhed for, and relyed on) would give i 
them an opportunity of making them- ^ 
felves Sovereigns in their refpe&ive Maflh 
nors.

Mean whil^ the Deed of &^nent was 
approved at Rome; and himrclf wor- 
jrtlhipped m Paris. The Holy League ac- 
^kn<>wlec^ed for their King the Cardinal 
oi Bourbm^ an old Prieft, Uncle to Henry 
the Fourth, in order to ftiow the World 
that it was the Hereticks, and not the 
Houfe of Bourbon^ which their Ha^^rcd 
purfued. * ' 

Thus the Duke of M^enne was wife 
enough not to aflume the Title of King, 
yet to gee all the Royal Power in his 
hands ; while the miierable Cardinal of 
Bourbon, whom the League call'd^King, 
was kept Prifoner by Henry t;he Fourta 
during the remainder of his Life, which 
lafted but two Years;. 

The League more fupported than ever 
by the Pope, affifted by the Spaniards, 
and extremely powerful by itfelf, was 
at the height of its Grandeur, and looked 
down upon Henry the Fourth with that 
Hatred which Religion inlpires, and 
with a Contempt begot by their Suc- 
ceiTes. 

Henry had few Friends, few great 
Towns, no Money, a imall Army^ but 
his Courage, his Aftivity, his Policy 
fupplied all thole Wants. Kfe gained fe- 
veral Vi<ftorics, efpecially that of lyry 
againft Mayenm. This Battle was one 
the moft remarkable that ever was 

fought.

fought. The two Generals exerted on 
thit Day all their Art, the Soldiers all , 
their Courage; few Faults were com- 
mitted on either fide. Hemy owed at 
Uft the Viftory to the Superiority of his 
Knowledge and Valour i but he confefs'd 
that Mayemie had fulfilled all the Duties 
of a great General. He was^ faid the 
King, deficient only in his Caufe. 

He proved as clement in the Viflory as . 
he was terrible in the Battle. He knew be- ^ 

fides, that Power is often leffened by the j 

full ufe of it, and extended by Moderation. 
He ftoppM the Fury of the Soldiers who 
were purfuirig the Enemy, he took care 
of the Wounded, fer at liberty many Pri- 
foners. Yet fo much Valour, and fo 
mwh Generdfity, did aot mollify the 
Heart cf the League. f 

The >Civil Wafs of Trance were now 
become the Quarrel Qi Europe, King 
Philip the .S^con4 ^as eagerly engaged 
in the jDtefence of the League : Queen 
Elix^th gave a:ll forts of Afliftance to 
Hem% not becaufe he was a Proteftant ; 
but becaufe he^ was an Enemy to Philip 
the Second, wbofe incroaching Power was 
dangerous to herfctf : Shefent him five 
thoufand Men under the Command of th$ 
Earl of Ejjex^ her Favourite, the fame 
whom ihc caufed afterwards to be be- ; ;^! 
headed. ,

Th? King continued the War with va-^ 
rious Succefs :. In one Day he took by 
Storm all the Suburbs of Paris. He had 
taken the Town perhaps lil^ewife, had 
he had no other View but to conquer. 
But he. was afraid of giving up his Ca- 
pital as a Prey to the Soldiery, and of de- 
ftroying the City which he had a mind 
to lave. He befieged Paris^ he raifed 
the Siege, he begun it again ; at laft 
he blocked it up, and cut off all the 
Communications to * the Town, hoping 
that the Scarcity of Provifions would 
force the Parifians to furrender without 
Bloodfhed. 

But Mayenne^ the Priefts, and the Six- 
teen Burgefles managed fo dexteroufly thq 
Spirits of the People, worked up their . 
Hatred againft the Hereticks to fuch a 
Decree, and fopl'd their Imgaination to 
fuch an Enthufiafm, that they chofe ra- 
ther todie by Hunger, than to fubmit. 

The Fryars and the Monks made a 
Show, which, as ridiculous as it was in 
itfelf, was yet of great ufe to animate 
the People. They made a kind of mili- 
tary Mufter, marching in Rank and 
Files, wearing rufty Armours over their 
Cowls, having at their Head the Fi- 

fure of the Virgin Mary, wielding 
words in their Hands, and crying, they

were ail ready to fighr, and to die in the 
Defence of the Faith. So that the Citi- 
zens, who fa w their G)nfc(rors in Arms, 
thought really that they fought the Caufe 
of God. 

However, Scarcity occafioned foon an 
univcrfal Famine. That prodigious Mul- 
titude of Citizens had no other Support 
but the Sermons of their Priefts, and the

ESSAY 

O N 

Epick poetry. 



WE have in ere: 
Rules than E 
Men are more 
ing, than able to perform ; 
more Commentators than E 
r/ Writers who (:ould n 
Verfes, have OTcr-charged us with volu- 
minous Treatifes of Poetry, All thofe 
Teachers feem to have much labour'd by 
their Definitions, Diftinftions, &c. to 
fpread a profound Obfcurity over Things' 
in their own Nature clear and perfpicu- 
ous ; and 'tis no wonder if fuch Lawgi- 
vers, unequal to the Burthen which they 
took upon themfelves, have embroii'd the 
States which they intended to Kinilate. 

C J '^ The 



TW 



(?8) 
The greateft Part of the Cricicks have 
fetched the Rules of Efkk poetry £rooi 
the Books of Homer, according to the 
Cuftom, or rather, to the Weaknefs of 
Men, who miftake commonly the Begin- 
ning of an Art, for 'the Principles of the 
i Art itfelf ; and are apt to believe, that 

every Thing muft be by its own Natnre, 
what it was, when contrived at firft. 
But a^ Homer wrote two Poems of a 
quite different Nature, and as the JEneii 
of l^irgil partakes ot the Iliad, and of 
the Odfjfey^ the Commentators were forced 
to eftabliih different Rules t6 rccbncUo 
Homer with himfelf, and other new 
Rules again to make l^gil agree with 

HomiT : Juft as the Aftrondmers laboured 
tmder the Neceffity of adding to, or tft- 
l^ing from their Syftesis, am of bring* 
ing in concentric and eiicentric Circles,' 
as the difcovered new Motions in thq. 
^leavens. 

The b[norance of the Aftronomefs 
was excuiable, and tbeif S^rch afte;: 
the unfathomable Syften) of Nature^ was 
to be commended ,- because it is certain, 
that Nature hath its own' Prihciple) ntfr 
variable, unerring, and as worthy of our 
Search, as remote from our CoQceptions. . 

. But it is not with the Inventions of 
Art, *s with the Works of Nature. The 
fame Fapcy which hath iovfinted ij^oe--!

try, changes every d^y til its Trodu- 
^ions, becaufe it is liable itfelf to cter- •• 
nal Viciffitudcs. The Poetry and Mufick 
of the Perfians^ differ as much from ours, 
as their Language. Even a Nation differs 
from itfelf, in lets than a Century. There. 
arc not more Revolutions in Governments, 
than in Arts. They are Ihiftin^, and gli- 
ding away from our Purluit,when we en-. 
deavour to fix them by our RiUes and De- 
jSnitions. 

K I am to give a Definition of a Suit 
cf Clothes, I ought not to defcribe any 
particular one. Neither the Roman nor 
the Greek^ nor the French ought to be fet 
up for a Pattern. A Suit of Clothes in 
)€lelf, is the Covering of the Body, that 
is all that is efTential to it. The reft is 
but acceflfary Ornament, which Fancy 
and Cuftom create, preferve, and de- 
ftroy at their Will ; and if we like one 
Fafhion beft, we are not to exclude every 
pther. 

So 'tis perhaps with Epic^ Poetry. 
The Word Epick comes from Efos^ which 
toiific5 Difcourfe. An Epkk Poem is a 
Kfcoiirfe in Verfe. Ufe alone has pre- 
fixed the Nanrxc of Epick^ particularly to 
thofe Poems which relate fome great 
A£lion. Let the Aftion be fingle or 
complex, let it lie in one fingle Place, as in 

C 4 t^.

the Iliad^ or let the Hero wander all the 
World over, as in the Odijfey ; let , 
there be one fingle Hero, or a great 
many ; happy, • or unfortunate ; f uri- ♦ 
ous as AihilleSy or pious as JEneas; let 
them be Kings, or Generals, or neither 
of them ; let the Scene lie upon tht Indian, 
Ocean, as in the Lufiada of Cimmens ; 
in the tVe/i-lidies, as in the Araucana of 
Alom.0 of Ereilla ; in Hell, in Heaven, 
out of the Limits of our Nature, as in 
Milton ; the Poem will equally deferve 
the Name of Epick^ unlefs you have a 
mind to honour it with another Title pro- 
portionable to its Merit. 

In fo boundlefs a Career, the Point of 
the Queftion, and of the Difficulty, is to 
know what all polite Nations agree upon, 
and in what they differ. 

An Epick Poem ought to be grounded 
upon Judgment, and embcUiih'd by Ima- 
gination J what belongs to good Scnfe, 
>elongs to all the Nations of the World. 
The Greeks^ the Romans, tt^ Italians, 
French, Englifh and Spaniards^ tell us in 
all their Works, that they chiefly Ijjce 
Unity of ASiion, becaufe the Und€r- 
ftanding is better fatisfy'4 when it repo-? 
fes upon a fingle Objeft, adequate to our 
Vicur, and which we may take in eafily» 
than when ;t \s loft i^^ the Hurry ol 
(ilcmfufipi^.

They tell us, chat fuch an Umty 
oudit to be attended with Variety, as a 
Body is made up of Members, all di&- 
reot, and all conducive to the fame End ; 
That the Aftion fliould be greats to ftrike 
us with A\¥c ; inurejling^ becaufe we dc- 
l^ht in being moved ; entire^ that our 
Mmds may t^ wholly fatisfy'd. 

Thefe, and the like, are a kind of 
eternal Laws, fubmitted to by all Na- 
tions, becaufe ena£ted by Nature. But 
the Machinery^ the Efifodes, the Stile it- 
felf, and all that depends upon that In- 
ftinft caird Tafte, and upon the Tyranny 
of Cuftom, that is the Point in which 
there are too many Opinions and no 
Rules. 

It is true, there are Beauties which 
the Tafte of every Nation equally relilh. 
Since all Europe hath fet up the Greek 
and Rfiman Authors £ar Models of Wri- 
ting, Homer and Demcfihenes, Virgil and 
Tmy, [have in fome meafure united un- 
der tlfeir Laws our European Nations, 
and made of fo many and different Coun- 
tries, a fingle G>mmon wealth of Letters. 
But fkill our particular Cuftoms have in - 
troduc'd among them all, a new Sort oC 
Tafte, peculiar to each Nation. 

The beft modem Writers hav^ mix'd 
the Tafte of their Country, with that of 
^ Ancients* Their Flowers^ and their 

Fruits, 



C4>> 

Fruits^ warmM and ihaturM by the fittie 
San, yet draw from the Soil they ' git)w 
upon, their di6Eerent Colours, their Ba* 
vburs and their Sze. It is as eafy to di«« 
ftinguifh a Sfanifh^ an bakan, or an Bxig-i « 

1^ Author, by their Stile, as to know 
by their Gait, their Speech, and their 
Features, in what Country they were 
bom. 

The JioliaH Softnefe, their Wittieifiii, *^ 
fb often degenerating into Conceit, the 
pompous and flietaphoriCal Stite c^ the 
^miardy the Exaonefs and Perif^uity 
cf the French^ the Strength peculiar to 
the Englijb, their Fondneft of Allegon; 
ries, their runnmg into Siimles, are & 
many diftinguKhable Marks, which do 
not efcape the Obfervation of proper \ 

Judges. 

From their different CharaAers flowsi^ 
that diflike which every Nation fliows fior 
the Tafte of its Neighbour. Hence it is 
that the Battle of the Angdis in Mikpn, 
would not fucceed among the Premb^ 
Hence ic is, that the long, but noble 
Speeches of Gnna^ and Augujius . in .Odt- 
mitte, could not be tolerated tipod the 
JE^f/z/^^tage.

No Lights but rather a Darknefs vifibk^ 
Served only to dif cover Sights rf Woe. 

Antonio de Solis, in his excellent: Hifto*

Thought, when fpcaking of the Htce 
wherein Montezuma was wont to confult 
his Deities ; *' 'Twas a large dark fub- 
** terran(|pu^ Vaults fays he,, whore fome 
*' difmalTBapers afforded jufk Light cnoi^h 
'* to fee th*Obfcurity." 

Such daring Thoughts would be looked 
trpon as Nonienfe, by a French CriticK, 
whofe Exaftnefs is often called in Eng-^ 
land Timidity. And fince the greateft 
Poet among the Englijh, and the bcft 
Writer among the Sfaniards, have not 
fcrapled to indulge now and then fuch 
Flights bordering on Bombaft, that proves 
at leaft, that in their Countries, the 
Authors have a more free Scope than in 
France. 

I need no more Examples to demon- 
ftrate, that there is fuch a Thing as a 
National Tafte. 

Jhis once gfanted, if we have a Mind 
to get a true Knowledge of Efi^k Poetry, 
it would be worth our while to take a 
Survey of all the diflferent Poems of that 

Kind, 



'< 45 ) 

Kind, which have focceeded in different 
Ages, and in diflfercnt Countries. 

TTis' not enough to be acquainted with 
Virgil, and Homer : As in regard to Tra- 
gedy, a Man who has only perufed So^ 
f hocks and Euripides, could not have an 
entire Notion of the Stage. We fhould 
be their Admirers, not their Slaves. We 
do not fpeak the fame Language. Our 
Religion (the great. Bafis of Epick Poe- 
try) is the very Reverfe of their Mytho- 
logy : Our Battles, our Sieges, our Fleets, 
are more diflferent from theirs, than our 
Manners from thofe oi America. The In- 
vention of Gun-powder, th»t of the Com- 
pafs^ that of Printing, fo many Arts 
belides newly emerged 'into the World, 
have altered the Face of the Univerfe; 
and an Epick Poet, being furrounded with 
fo many Novelties, muft have but a fmall 
(hare of Genius, if he durft not be bew 
himftif.

homer: 

IT would (eem too afTuming, ftnd piMz 
very nfclcfe, to expatiate upon Homer 
and VirgiU efpecially in England^ where 
there is fcarce a Gentleman unacquainted 
with Latin and GreA. 

As to Homtr, thofe who cannot read 
him in the Original, havd Mr. Pope^s 
Tranflation ; they may difcern the Fire of 
that Father of Poetry, reflefted froni fudi 
a'polifh'd and faithml Glafs. I wilt neh» 
ther point out his Beauties, (ince none of 
them are loft in the Tranflation ; nor cavil 
at his Faults, which are for the moft part 
lefTenM or embcllifh'd 

Let every Reader confult himfelf, when 
he reads Homer, and reflcft how that Poem 
works upon his Mind; then he will judge 
if Homer hath reached t6 the utmoft pitch 
of the Art, in any thing elfe but in that 
predominatit Force oiPaimir^y which makes 
his peculiar Charafter. '. 

Notwithftanding the Veneration due^ 
and paid to Homer, it 'is very ftrange, 
yet true, that among the moft Learned^ 
and the greateft Admirers of Anti- 
quity, there . is fcarce ore to be founds 
who^ ever read the Hiad with that 
Bagernefs and Rapture, which a Wo- 
man feels when flie reads the Hovel 

of 



(49-) 

of Zai'da : and as to the common Ma Cs 
of Readers, left converfanc with Let- 
ters, but not perhaps endowed with a 
lefs fhare of Judgment and Wit, few 
have been able to go through the whole 
Iliady without ftruggling agaiiift a fecret 
Diflike, and fbme have thrown it afide 
after the fourth or the fifth Book. How- 
does it come to pafs, that Homer hath fo 
many Admirers, and fo few Readers ? 
And is at the fame time worfliipped and 
negledled ? 

ril Endeavour to give fome Reafons 
for this Paradox. The common part of 
Mankind is awed with the Fame of Ho- 
mer^ rather than ftruck with his Beau- 
tics. The judicious Reader is pleafed, no 
doubt, with the noble Imagination of 
that great Author ; but very few have 
Command enough over their own Preju- 
dices, and can tranfport themfelves far 
enough into fuch a remote Antiquity, a$ 
to become the Contemporaries of Homer 
when they read him : Good Senfe bids 
them po make allowances for the Man- 
ners of his Time, but 'tis almoft impof- 
fible to bring themfelves to a quick Re- 
lifli of them. The Rays of his Light 
tranfmitted to their Eyes through fo 
k>Qg a Way,; afibrd them but a feeble 
glimmering Twilight, and no Warmth. 
They, are like the old CounfejUors of 

D Priam^ 



C so) 

Priam^ who conCeflfed without anyEmor 
tion of Heart, that Hekna was a Beauty. * 

A fecond Reafon of their Diflike, is 
that Uniformity which fecms difiufed 
through all the Work. The Battles tabs 
tip three parts of the whole Biad. The 
Reader is more likely to be difgufted by 
the continual Glare of that predominant 
Colour which is fpread over the Poem, 
dian to be pleafed with the Variety of 
Teints, and Shades, which require a re- 
fined Sight to perceive them. 

Thirdly, the Poem is certainly too long, 
and 'tis an Exception, that all the Efick 
Poets are liable to ; for there is no Efick 
Poetry without a powerful Imagination, 
and no great Imagination without over- 
flowing- 

1 wave here all the Quarrels raifed by 
the Enemies of Hcmer, to fuck parts of 
his Poems, as may be the Obje£ts of our 
Cricicifm, but never the Caufe of our 
Sleep. 

His Gods are perhaps at once abfurd 
and entertaining, as the Madneis of Ariofta 
amufes us with a bewitching Delight* 
And for his other Faults, the MaJOTiy, 
and the Fire of his Stile, brightens them 
often into Beauties. 

But in my opinion, the beft Reafon 
for that Languor which creeps upon the 
Mind of fo many ReaderSj in Ipite ofv 

thev 



r 

the FJafties which roufe it no\v and then, 
is, that Homer interefles us for none of 
his Heroes. Achilles is too boifterous to 
infpire us with a tender Concern for him. 
And fuppofe his very Fiercenefs could 
extort irom' us that favourable Difpofi- 
tion Which the over-powering Idea of 
Y^Iour generally forces us into, his long 
Idlenefs wears away the Thought of hinn, 
and as the Poet lays him afide, fo does the 
Reader. 

MenelauSy who is the only Occafion of 
the War, and in whom of courfe our 
Affeftions ought to center, is very far 
from being a fliining Character. Paris^ 
his Rival, excites our Contempt. Afr- 
nelaus is in the Poem but the Brother 
of Agamenmott^ and Paris the Brother of 
He£ior. Agamemnon^ King of Kings, 
ihocks us with his Pride, without gi- 
ving us any great Idea of his Condu£tr 
I do not know how it comes to pafs, 
but every Reader bears fecretly an Ill- 
will to the wife Ulyjfes. The fair flip/f- 
na, the Gaufe of fo great Mifchiefs, is 
infignificanc enough. Nobody cares wbofe 
(bare flie will fall to, fince Ihe feems 
herfelf indiflfcrent between her two Huf- 
bands. 

When two Warriors fight in the Iliad, 
we are awed ipdeed with the Delcrip-' 
tion, nay ofijcn transported with their 

D 2 Fury; 



(51) 

Fury 5 but we feel neither Hope nor Fear 
for any of them. 

We are like Juno in the jEneid, 

Tros Rutulufve fuat^ nuUo dtfcrimine hor 

\bebQ. 

We pity indeed the Misfortunes of 
Priam^ nor will I quarrel with the Tears 
that we give to his AfHiftions. I wilh 
only that Homer would have interefted 
us for the Greeks^ throughout all the 
Poem, fince he intends to praife them^ 
and fince they are the Heroes of the Poem ; 
but Til go no further than to obferve, 
that if we are moved with the Sorrow 
of Priam, at the very End of the Poem, 
we are indifferent towards him in the 
Courfe of the Adlion. 

Of all the Warriors, the courageous, 
the tender, and the pious Heilor^ de- 
ferves mofk our Affections. He hath the 
beft Charafter, though he defends the 
wrong Caufe ; and he is betrayM by the 
Gods, though he hath fo much Virtue. 

But our Concern for him is loft, in the 
Crowd of fo many Heroes. Our Atten- 
tion is divided, and leffen'd, like a Stream 
cut into many Rivulets. 

Thus the Reader^s Imagination is of- 
ten filled with great and noble Ideas, 
while the Aflfeftions of the Soul ftag- 
V - * ' pate; 



nate; and if in any long Work whate- 
ver, the Motions of the Heart do not 
ieep pace with the Pleafures of the Fan- 
cy, 'tis no wonder if we may at once 
admire and be tir'd. 

If all thefe Reafons are contefted (for 
what AfTertion of our Mind is undif- 
putable ?) I muft add a further Ohferva- 
tion; which is a Matter of Fad out of 
the reach of Difpute. Many of the 
Books of the Iliad are independent from 
one another ; they might - be tranfpos'd 
without any great Alteration in the 
Aftion : And perhaps, for that Reafon, 
they were call*d Rapfodies. I leave to 
the Judgment of the Reader, if fuch a 
Work, let it be never fo well written, 
never fo teeming with Beauties, can be in- 
terefting, and win our Attention. 

VIRGIL. 

MR. Addifon was the firft who con- 
fidered in their proper View the 
Materials which composed the Strufturc 
of the JEneid. 

It is certain Virgil framM his Poem 
out of many Fables concerning the Set- 
tlement of ^neas in Italy ^ handed down 
to his Time, which were credited by 
the People, with a kind of fupcrftitious 
JBelief.

dovvn by he Bvjfu^ wno bids an Epick 
Poet invent, and difpcfethc Conftitution 
of his Fable, before he thinks of the 
Name of his Heroes, is not indeed aa- 
tuial : In all likelihood they did not cut 
the Coat, without knowing whofe Shape 
it could fit. Such a Rule may be obfer- 
vcd in Comedy, which deals chiefly in 
the Expofition of the Manners, and of 
the Ridicule of the A^e ; or delights 
in a Plot, made up of^furprizing, but 
little Incidents, which never require the 
Teftimony of Hiftory, or the Weight of 
any celebrated Name. 

But the Epick^ as well as the Tragick 
Poets, generally pitcK ^pon a Subjeft, 
and a Hero well known, whofe fingle 
Name muft ftrike the Reader with Awe, 
and command his Attention. They a- 
dapt their Invention to the Hiftory, for 
if one fliould begin by laying down a 
Fable intirely oi his own Imagination, 
all the Records in the Univerfe could 
not afford him an Event, adequate to 
his Plan; he muft need^ alter it. And 
I canQot apprehend why Mr. Le Bofii 

tdvitts 



(ss) 

advifesto build what muft fiecefTarily be 
deftroyU 

Whatever it be. Part of the Events 
included in the ^neid^ are to be found 
in Dionjfius HaUcamaJfus. He mentions 
With Accuracy, the Courfe of the "Navi- 
gaticn of ^urox. He does not omit the 
Fable of the Harpies^ the Prediftions ut- 
tered by CeUnoy the eating up of the 
Cakes, &c. 

As to the Meutmorphoie of the Ships 
into Nymphs, if Dionyfius does not men- 
tion it, Virgil himfelf takes care to jufti- 
fy fuch an Abfurdicy, by telling us, that 
it was an antient Tradition ; 

Ffifea fides fa^o^ fed jama fetemis. 

It feems that J/irgily aikam'd of fuch a 
fairy Tale, hath a mind to excuie it by 
the common Belief. 

Many Parages of Virgil conlidered in 
this View, are intirely vindicated againft 
bis Critick^ whole good Senfe was mif- 
led in that Particular by their Inatten* 
lion* 

If an Author among the F\rimb at* 
tempts a Poem on Clovis^ he is ^low'd 
to fpeak of the Holy Vial, brought down 
from Heaven in the Bill of a Dove, in- 
to the Cbureh «f ^im, for tbe CoroN 
M?}on of the King. If an EHfUP^ Wri- 

D 4 ter 



.er takes K^ng Arthur for his Subjeft, he 
,nay wichout Cenfurc bring in the In- 
canr.itions o^ Merlin ^ it being the Fate 
of all thcl'e antient Fables, which the . 
Beijinnin' of every Nation is involved in^ 
to be revered for their Antiquity, when 
they are laujTt/d at for then- Abfurdity : 
but upon the Whole, it would be better / 

to omit them, though we are allowed to 
inentit n them ; for a fingle Reader of 
Senfe, who will be Ihock'd at fuch $to* 
ries, dcferves more Refpeft, than the 
Crowd which gives them Credit. 

As to the Conftruftion of , his Fable, 
he is accus'd by fome, and commended 
by others, for having followed Homer 
clofely ; but if I dare fpeak my Opinion, ^ 

he deferves neither fuch an Injury, nor 
fuch a Conipliment. He could not avoid 
introducing the Gods of Horner^ who 
were the Roman Gods too, nor talking c^ 
the Siege of Tray, fince ^neas was a Trq- ^ 
jan Hero. 

Thofe Things were common to the 
Greek Author, and to him. He draws 
his RichefTes from the fame Source, 
but not at the Expence of his Prede- 
cefibr* 

^>X^7i 'tis true, hath tranflate^ fome 
Paflfages of the Wad, ttnd^ the Odiffey ; < 
he hath borrowed i9|kc ^^^^ Dofcrip-

ly his great Genius did not want, by 
which but a Jittle Glory could accrue to 
him, and which are rather an Honour 
paid by him to Horner^ than a Proof o£ 
his ftanding in need of Help* 

^is pleafant to fee how fome Criticks 
have triumphed, in the Difcovery of thofe 
Trifles. Thofe who take up Arms for /fo- 
i»^, againft f^rgi/, and who facrifice the 
Pleafure <^ being plcas'd with both, to 
the chimerical Fancy of raifing the Glo- 
ry of the one, at the expence of the o- 
ther, pretend that Dido is the Copy of 
Calipfo :. That -^»^^/ is fent to the Shades 
^fter Vjyjlfesj and the like. Let the Rea- 
ders compare thofe pretended Copies with 
the ftipposM Original, they will find a 
wonderful IXffereftce. 

The Paffion of Dido^ her Misfortune, 
her Death, brought in as the Caufe of 
that cvcrlafting Hatred between Carthage 
and Rome ; and Anchifes calling forth from 
the Womb of Time, the Fate of the Rxh 
man. Empire ; all thefe Beauties are not 
certainly owing to Homer. 

It is not in the Nature of a Genius^ 
to be a Copift, Wherever Vtrgil is great, 
he is himfelf ; but in thofe little Paiutges 
-borrowed from Horner^ he commonly 
falls (licrt of the Original % and 'tis ^

If he has ftolen from them^ th^n he 
hath iiot robb'd Homer. But all that ought 
to be flatly deny'd i and the only Anfwer 
which is to be made to fuch Difcoveries^ 
is, that the feqond and fourth Book en.

The trrrfi Poet lay uoder theNecefll- 
ty of f applying the Abience of his firdt 
Hero, with fome other Warriors ; ^ buc 
what was judicipus in Ikmer^ would 
have been prepofterous in Vtrgil: flle 
knew coo much of his Art, to drown 
bis principal Chara£ber in the Crowd of 
many ocher Heroes, indifferent to the 
main Aftion. 

Thus lac found the Way to center our

Monk^ than of an Empire. 'Tis true, 
'^neas hath the Misfortune to pais ge<- 
nerally. under the Notion of a (»ous 

H^m' and not a gr^ac Warrior > the 
-' *.' ^ Fault 



/ 



(6o) 

Fault IS not in P^rgil, it lies in the 
wrong Notions which the Generality 
of Mankind entertains of Courage. Our 
Eyes are dazzlM with the boifterous 
Fury of a wild Hero. Had Ptrgil been 
lefs wife, had the Courage of /Eneas been 
a barbarous Raflfinefs, inftead of a fedate^ 
and calmly-daring Valour, perhaps he 
might pleafc better, but furely he would 
delerve it lefs. 

It is a juft Criticifm on Virgil, that the 
latter Part of his Poem is le& anin^ated 
than the firft, not that the fix laft Books 
are intirely languifhing, but their milder 
Light is overpowered by the Luftre of the 
others. 

That great DefeA is owing to the Dif- 
pofition of the Poem, and to the Nature 
of the Things. The Defign <^ a Match 
between jEueas and Lavinia, unknowa 
and indifferent to each other, and a War 
rais'd about a Stag wounded by a young 
Boy, could not indeed command out Con- 
cern as well as the burning of Troy^ and 
the Love of I>iV/o.

timents and Grandeur; his Poem had 
been as unexceptionable as the Bounds of 
human Talents will permit. In ihort, his 
Fault lies in having reached to the utmolt 
pitch of the An in the middle of his Courfe. 

LU C A N. 

AFter we have lifted up our Eyes to- 
wards Virgily arid Hwier^ we need 
not look down on the other Roman Au- 
thors who have been ftumbling in the fame 
Career. Let us lay afide their mean and 
monftrous Mimicks^ Statius, and Silius Ita^ 
licus; but we ought not to overlook Lucany 
who took entirely a new Courfe, and 
whofe free Genius borrow'd neither its 
Beauties^ nor its Faults. 

He was of an antient Equeflrian Fami-^ 
ly, born at Ordcva in Sfaiu under CjA- 
gula ; he was brought to EMme when 
eight Months old, and educated there^ 
under the Influence of his Uncle Serieca, 
with the nice Care that his Birth, his 
opulent Fortune, and efpecially the Preg- 
nancy cf his early Genius deferved. I 
mention this, only to filence thofe Cri- 
ticks who have call'd in queftion the Pu- 
jity of his Language ; they took him for 
a Spaniard, who wrote Roman Verfes ; 
and prepoffefled with that Notion, they 
fancied they difbovcred in his Language 
- - fome 



( '6^ ) 

fome Faults which do not i^Uy exift ; and 
which if they did e^cifi, could not be per- 
qeivM by any Modern. 

He was at firft a Favourite to iVJfre, 
till be had the noble Imprudence to con- 
tend with him for the Prize of Poetry; 
and the dangerous Honour of carrying 
it. 

He praifed that Emperor in his^Pihir- 
falia^ while iNfo'o was yet the Delight of 
die Empire ; he confpired againft himj 
when the Emperor became a Tjrant. Ail 
the World knows be was i^enteno^ to 
die ; and the Choice .of the Manner (^ 
bis Death bdng left to him^ . he chofe t^ 
have the Veins of his Arms and l,eg$ 

?»en'd in a hot Bath ; and died with that 
ranquillity^ which in thpi^ niomeiits is 
the trui^GreatAefs of Soul. 

He was not the firft who f bought a re* 
crat Hiftoiy the proper Subjed of aii 
l^isk P<)em, for Varius had ventured be- 
fore him (and with Succe&) on fuch a 
dahgofous Undertakings 

The Broximity of the Times, and th^ 
Notoriety of the Event$ which he took 
for his Theme, were certainly a great 
Clog to his Poetical Invention^ (if he 
had any.} 

The greater his Su^'eft was; thc|^a- 
ter the Difficulty. G?A»r and P^m^l 
were, no doubt, Men of bigbwr inpor-^

the War waged before the Walls of Trojr, 
and before Latium^ were but Frays of 
diMldi:^ in comparifbn of the Roman 
CivU War» in which the greateft Men of 
A^me fou^t for the Empire of the 
World. 

L$ieaM could hardly give any fcope to his 
ImagtnatioB on a SubjeA fo well known, 
and with more difficulty come up to its 
Grandeur* On thefe accounts the Frame 
of Us Poem is dry and tedious, becaufe he 
dafesnot deviate from the Hiftory ; and his 
Stile fwells too often into Fuflian, when 
he endeavours to raife it to the Anions of 
his Heroest 

So ^neas and Achilles^ who were in- 
conliderabJe in. tihemfelves^ are for ever 
gffeat in Hmner and Virgil; while Cafar 
and Pomptey fmk under the Bombafl: <^ Lu^

Sublime licre and there, faulty through all 
the Work. 

He is to be commended for having* 
laid the Gods aHde, as much as Honur 
and Virgil for having miade ufe of that 
Machinery. Thofe Fables were adapted 
to the dark fabulous Ages in which Priam 
and Latinus lived, but no way fuitable 
to the Wars of Rome. What brightens 
the Charafter of ^neas, and confers a 
Majefty on the inconfiderable Beginnings 
of Rome^ would have dcbafed the Ch»* 
rafter of Cafar^ and drawn a Ridiculer 
upon hiin. What a poor Figure would 
that Conqueror make in the Field of Phar^ 
falia, fliould he be affifted by Iris, or by 
Mercury ? 

Methinks that fhows evidently that 
the Intervention of the Gods is not ab- 
Iblutely required in an Epick Poem. They 
are fo far from being neccflary, that the 
beft PafTage of Lucan '(and perhaps of all 
the Poets) is the Speech of Cato in the 
ninth Book, when he fcorns to c^nfixlt 
Jupiter. 'T\s not for want of God^, but 
for want of managing with Art the Af- 
fairs of Men, that Lucan is inferior ta 
Virgil. 

The Judgment of the World is juftly 
pafTed upon him. He is looked upon as 
a ftrong Genius, tho* not as a good Po«: ; 
and the precious Scones which ihine in the

ftine in our Eyes. Monfieuf de Corneilk 
was ufed to fay, that he was more indebted 
to Lucan than to Vhgil, Not that he was 
fo unjuft, and of io injudicious a Tafte, 
as^ to prefer the Phavfalia to the j^neid. 
But an Author who brings real Heroes 
upon the Stage, has but little to do with . 
Poetical Fidtions, and will be better 
help'd by the vigorous Tiioughts of L«- 
caUy than by the elegant Narration of 
Virgil, Mr. Addifon borrowed from the 
Pharfalia fome Strokes, in the drawing 
of his Cato, That antient. Poet never re- 
ceived a greater Hoik)ur, than when h^ 
was imitated by Mr. de CorneiJle, and by 
Mr. Addifotty two Men every way fuperior 
to him. 

TRIS S I NO. 

AFTER the Fall of the Roman Em- 
pire in the Wefl^ feveral Kingdoms 
rofe out of its Ruins, and many Lan- 
guages were form 'd out of the Remains 
of the Latin Tongue. The Northern Inva- 
ders brought every where their Rough- 
nefs and their Ignorance : Their Lan-' 
guage made up at firft of a corrupted 
LatiHy and of irregular Gothicky was as 
uncouth as their Manners, and as defti- 
tuteof Words, $.$ their Minds oi Ideas.

In the Courfe of a Thouland Years, the 
Italians^ the French, the Spaniards, rcfin'd 
their Manners and their Idioms. And 
Learning fpreading itfelf by degrees al- 
moft over all Europe, enlargM the Sphere 
of every Language. 

Many Writers complain now-a-days, 
that the Latin is ufed only in the Schods^ 
and in the Romifl> Churches ; they upbraid 
the Infufficiency of modern Language ; 
they fay that their own Idioms fink un- 
der their Imagination. But they would 
have more to complain of^ i^ according 
to their Defires, the Latin was ftill the 
Language of Europe ; for in that cafe, 
very little Room would be left for their 
Labours. A Multitude of Ancient Au- 
thors more generally read, and better un- 
derftocd, would fliut up all the Avenues 
to the Ambition of the Modem. To imi- 
tate Virgil or TuBy^ would be a Plariarifm ; 
to deviate from them, an Affeftation : 
The World, over-ftock'd with Models of 
Writing, would difcounrenance any new 
Endeavour ; and the greatefk Genius would 
be difcouraged. 

On the contrary, he who writes in a 
modern Language^ hath the Ancients 
for his Guides, not for bis Rivals ; when 
he imitates them, he enriches his own 
Country > the panicular Caft of bis 
Mocher-tcmgue^ aw^ens fais Imi^nadon 

into 



jnto new Turns, and (jeftows an Air of 
Novelty on fomc Conceptions, which o- 
tbcrwife would have appeared too common. 
In ihort, every new Language occafions 
Ipme new Produftions. 

The ItaUoH Tongue, was, at the End of 
the fifteenth Century, brought to the Per- 
fe^ion, in which it continues now ; and 
in which it will remain, as long as T'affo in 
Foetry, and AhMavel in Profe, fliall be 
the Standard of the Stile. 
. Tajfo was in his Childhood, when 
Iriffim (the Author of the firft Tragedy 
written in a modern Language) launched 
out into the Attempt of an Epick Poem. 
Hish Subjeft was Italy deliver^ from the 
G0tk5 by Belifarius under Juftinian. The 
Subjefl was noble, the Performance was 
tnean, but ilill fucceeded ; and this Dawn* 
ing (hone a little in a Time of Darknefs, 
tin it was abforb'd in the broad Day of 

Trifj^no was a Man of great Parts, and 
of extenfive Learning ; he was employed 
by Lia the Tenth in many great Affairs, 
Und had fucceeded very well in his Em- 
baflfy ta the Emperor Charles the Fifth. 
Bnt at hft be facrificed his Ambition, 
and worldly A£tairs, to his Paffion . for 
Letters 5 which at that Time were re- 
puted honourable, becaufe they were 
newly revived in Europe^ and in the Glo- 

Ea ^ ry 






ry of their Prime. He was juftly fond 
of Horner^ and yet his great Fault is to 
have imitated him ; for Imitation re- 
quires more Art than i$ generally believed. 
The Flowers of the Ancients appear 
but wirherVi, when gathered by unskil- 
ful Hands. Thi^ I infift upon, be-^ 
caufe nothing is more common than Au- 
thors who mangle Homer and Virgil ia 
their own Productions, and fcrccn them-* 
felves under thofe great Names, with- 
out fufpefting that the very Things, 
which are to be admired in Virgil^ may 
be ridiculous in them. 

Thus Tritjino^ for Example, endea- 
vours to imitate that beautiful Paffaee of 
Homer, where "Juno having fummond all 
her Charms, and adorned with the Gir- 
dle of Venus ^ deludes her Husband into

Trrffino hath cfpeciaHy endeavoured to 
follow Homer in the Detail of the De-

fcribing the Furniture of the Houfes of 
his Heroes : He does not omit a Button, 
or a Garter in their Dreffes ; and does 
not fay a Word of their Charaders. 

However, I do not mention him only 
to point out his Faults ; but to give him 
the juft Praifes he defcrvcs, for having 
been the firft in Europe, ^ho attempted

WHILE Trijjino was clearing away 
the Rubbife in Italy^ which Barba- 
rity and Ignorance had heap'd up for ten 
Centuries, in the Way of the Arts and. 
Sciences, Camouens in Portugal fteer'd a new 
Courfe, and acquired a Reputation which 
lafts ftill among his Countrymen, who 
pay as much Refpefbtohis Memory^ as 
the E^gUfi to Milton. 

He was a ftrong Inftance of the irre- 
iiftible Impulfe of Nature, which deter- 
mines a true Genius to follow the Bent of 
his Talents, in fpight of all the Obftacles, 
which could check his Courfe. 

His Infancy loft amidft the Idlenefs and 
Ignorance of the Court of Lishn ; his 
Youth fpent in romantick Loves, or in the 
War againft the Moors ; his long Voyages 
at Sea, in his riper Years ; his Misfortunes 
at Court, the Revolutions of his Country ; 
none of all thefe could fupprefs his Genius.

that Ui^tlfrtak'ng, wliich being new, was 
accounted ra(h and imprnfticable, and 
which of courfe gained iiin?i a great Repu- 
tation when it fuccceded. 

Camouetts fcUow'd Velafco de Gama in 
that dangerous Voyage, led by his 
FricncKhip to him, and by a noble Cu- 
riofity, which feldom fails to be the Cha- 
rzditv of Men born with a great Imagi- 
nation. 

He took his Voyage for the Subjeft of 
his Poem ; he ^njoy'd the fenfible Plea- 
fure, which no body had known before 
him, to celebrate his Friend, and the 
Things which he was an Eye-Witiiefs 
of. He wrote his Poem, Part on ithe 
Atlantic SeUy and Part on the Inaian 
Shore; I ought not to omit, that in a 
Shipwreck on the Coafts of Malabar, he 
fwam a-lhore, holding up his Poem in one 
Hand, which otherwife had been perhaps 
loft for ever. 

Such a new Subjeft, managed by an 
uncommon Genius, could not but pro-

the World over-turn'd for her Caure ; 
no Empire founded ; in fliorc, nothing of 
what was deem'd before, the only Subject 
of Poetry. 

The Poet condufts the Portuguefe Fleet 
to the Mouth of the Ganges^ round the 
Coafts of Africk. He takes notice in 
the Way, of many Nations who live up- 
on the African Shore. He interweaves 
artfully the Hiftory of Portugal. The 
Simplicity of his Subjeft, is rais'd by fome 
Fiftions of different Kinds, which I think 
not improper to acquaint the Reader 
with. 

When the Fleet is failing in . fight 
cE the Cape of Good-Hope, call a then the 
Cape of the Storms, a formidable Shape 
appears to them, walking in the Depth 
of the Sea; his Head reaches to the 
Clouds, the Storms, tJi 
Thunders, and the Lightn: 
him; his Arms are extei 
Waves. 'Tis the Guardi 
reign Ocean unplough'd 
Ship. He complains of h 
to fubmit to Fate, and to the audacious 
■Undenaking of the Portuguefe, and fore- 
tels them all the Misfortunes which they 
muft undergo in the Indies. 

I believe, that fuch a Fiftion would 
be thought noble and proper, in all Ages, 
and in all Nations. 

There 



( 74 ), 

There is another, which perhaps would 
have pleas'd the Italians as well as the 
Pmuguefi, but no other Nation bcfides s 
It is an inchanted I(land, call'd the Ifland 
of Blifi, which the Fleet finds in her Way 
home, juft riling from the Sea, for their 
Comfort and for their Reward: Gj- 
moaem defcribes that Place, as To/To itid 
fome Tears after, his Ifland of Armida. 
There a lupernacural Power brings in all 
the Beauties, and prefents all the Hea- 
fures which Nature can ag'ord, and which 
the^ Heart may wifh for ; a Goddefs ena-- 
mour'd with Vakfio de Gama, carries him 
to the Top of an high Mountain, horn 
whence (he fliows him all the Kingdonis

cufo foc.fuch an Invention, is, the charm- 

' ing Scile in which it is deliver'd, (if we 

believe the Partuguefe;) for the Beauty of 

the Elocution makes fometimes amends for

fhifs. As if that barlarous African^ vas 
acquainted with Homer and Virgil: 

His Poena, in my Opinion^ is full of 
numberlcfs Faults and Beauties, thick 
fown near one another > and almoft in 
every Page, there is what to laugh at, 
and what to be delighted with. Among 
his mod lucky Thoughts, I muft take 
notice of two, for the Likenefs which 
. they bear to two moft celebrated Paffages 
of Waller and Sir John Denham. 

Waller fays, in his Epiftle to Zelinda; 

Thy matchUfs Form will Credit brings 
To all the Wonders I can fing. 

Camotiens fays, in fpeaking of the Voyages 
of the Argonauts, and of Ulyjfes^ that the 
Undertaking of the Portugii^efe fhall give 
Credit to all thofe Fables, in furpalling 
them. 

* Sir John Denham^ in his Poem on Coo^ 
fers-Htlly fays to the Thames • ' 

could Ifow like thee, and make thy Stream 
-My great Ex ample ^ as it is my T'heme ; 
T'fjO^ deep^ yet clear ; tho^ gentle, yet not dull ,; 
Strong without Rage, without overflowing full. 

Camonens addreCfes the Nymphs ofTi- 
gus in 'the like manner; " O Nymphs, 
'' if ever I fung of you, infpire me now 

V with 



(rrJ 

" with new and Urong Lays ; let my 
" Stile flow like your Waves ; let it bd 
t' deep and deaif,;ffS your W«ers,<irf/' 

It is not to be' inferred from thence,* 
that JValler and Sir John Deuham haw 
imitated Camuens ; . we muft only con- 
clude, that Wit is of the Growth of every 
Country. It is very unjuft, and very com- 
mon, to call Plagiarifm what is but Re- 
feni^knce. 



Tji S S O. , V 

TORQUATO taffo began his >«- 
JctUm^ when Camuens was finilhing 
his Lufiada. He us'd to fay, that the only 
Rival he fear'd in Europe, was Camouens. 
His Fear . Of fincer^) was very ill-ground- 
ed > for he was as far fuperior to him, as 
that Portuguefe excelled the Poets of his 
own Country, 

No Man in the World was ever born 
with^a greater Genius, and more- quali- 
fy d for Epick Poetry. His Talents which 
gam d him fo great a Reputation; were 
the Caufe of his Misfortunes, His Life 
P^ovd a Chain of Miferies and Woes. 
Baniih d from his oym Couptry, he was 
reduc d to the grievous Neceffity of having 
ft: Patron, He fufer'd Want, Exile,; ttid 
^'ntoni and which is^raore.intolQriWe, he 
y^ras^opprefs'd by Cafumny.

Even liis poetical Glory, that chimexttaf 
Comfort in real Calamtde^ was codtefted. 
The Number of his Enemies eclips'd for 
fl long while his Repntaaon : And at kft 
when his Merit began «o overcome Env]^ 
when he was ready to receive the Honour 
of Triumph in Rente, which Petrarch 
had formerly enjoy 'd (though with le& 
Merit) and which was at that time as 
glorious as it is now ridiculous ; he died 
the very Day before the defign'd Solemr^ 
nity. 

Nothing difcovers more plainlv the 
high Senlo which Rome entertai|rd of 
his Merit, than the Infcriptsion on his 
Tomb. 

The Pofe^ who ordered him a magni- 
ficent Funeral, as if it were to attone for 
tht Misfortunes ci his Life, proposM a 
Reward for the beft Epitaph wiiich fhould

greateft Encomium* 

Time, which undermines the Reputa- 
tion of indifferent Authors, hath ftampM 
the Charafter of Immortality upon his 
Works. His Poem is fung now-a-days in 
many Parts of Itafyy as the Poems of Homer 
were in Greece j and if the Poets, his Suc- 
ceflbrs, have degenerated from him, if 
baly is now over-growji with oitiful Son- 
xrees and Conceits; ftill the Tafte of the 
Nation formed after his Poems remains in 
its full force : He is admired by the Rea- 
ders, though not imitated by the Writers. 
Thus in France^ Comeille^ Racine^ Boileau^ 
la Fontaine, Moliere, will claim for ever 
the pubiick Admiration, in defiance to a 
fccceeding Set of Writers, who have in- 
troduced a ncw-fangl'd Stile, kept up and 
dxerifli'd among themfelves, bvt delpis*d 
by the Nation* 

The Jernfahm Uherata is in fome Parts 
an Imitation of the Iliad. The Subjeft of 
Ti^o is nobler than that of Hotter, in as 
much as all Europe^ rifing up in Arm?

As 



■( So ) 

As to the Difpofition of fo great a. 
Work, the impnitial Reader may judge 
if Tqffo is flbove, or under his Mafter^ 
in what he copies from him. 

Goj[,'edo afts methinks the Part of Aga^ 
memnon^ with as much Grandeur, lefs 
Pride, and more Wifdom. 

The Hermit Piero is the Calcas ; and if 
I dare fpeak my Opinion, I find nothing 
very Alining nor defedlive in either. 

Rinaldo is among the Chriflian Princes; 
what Achilles is among the Grecian He- 
roes. His * Courage is full as boifterous^ 
but his Charafter more amiable. The 
Fall of Jerufalem is referv'd to his Sword, 
as that o( Troy to the Arms of Achilles. 
The ift)fence of the one from the Camp, 
is borrowed from the Ina&ion of the 
other ; but certainly Rinaldo employs his 
Leifure more to the Satisfaftion oi the 
Reader, than the Hero of Homer does. 

AladinOj Siiltah of Jerufalem, is in no- 
things Jike Priam, but in his being the 
King of the Town befiegM ; and Argante 
bears no other Refemblance to HeUor, but 
in his being the firmeft Bulwark of the 
City. 

Certainly the Charafter oiHeBw is every 
way above that oi Argante, and the Gran- 
deur of Priam more ma jeftick, and his Mis- 
fortunes more touching than thofe of Ala-^ 

ditto* 



(8i ) 

tadin. I will not decide, if Homer bath 
done right or wrong, in gaining upon 
our Affeftions towards HeShvy and in 
moving our t^ity for Priam ; but fare it 
is, tbat if lajfo bad not reprefented Ala^ 
din and Argame rough and unamiable, 
if he bad not skilfully created an Aver- 
lion to them, in the Mind of the Rea- 
der, he had defeated his own Intention ; 
for in that cafe, inftead of being cm- 
iem^d for the Caufe of the Qjriftian 
Princes, we ihould look upon them as- 
Plunderers, united together to lay wafte 
a foreign Country, and to maflacre in 
cold Blood, an old venerable Eaftern 
Monarch, together with his innocent Sub- 

Tajfo hath 'learn'd from Homer, the 
Art of marking the different Shades of 
the fame Colour ; I mean the different 
Kinds of the fame Virtue^ of diftin- 
guiihing the Valiant from the Valiam, 
and the Prudent from the Prudent^ &c. 
Thus Goffredo is fedate and wife, Ala- 
din anxious and cruel. The generous 
Valour of Tancrede, (bines in oppofi- 
tion to the brutal Itnpetuofity of Argame. 
Love in Armida is a Mixture of Coquet- 
try and Rage, in Herminia a gentle Ten- 
demefs. Every one of his AAors is to 
be known by fome diftinguifliable Mark, 

F « a$ 



(82-) 

as in the lUad^ and every one of them afts 
always fuitable to his Charafter, which 
is not always to be found in Homer ; and 
in that refpeft methinks he hath improved 
the Art which Homer taught him ; biit 
an Art which he learn'd from no body. 
^Tis that inchanting Way of interefting 
us for his Heroes, 'tis that inexpreffible 
Addrefs in interweaving the diflferent Ad- 
ventures of the Poem, in leading us 
from the Alarms of Wars to the Allure-' 
ments of Love, and from Love to War 
again ;. in working up our Concern by 
degrees, and in rifing above himfelf froift 

* Book to Book. 

As to his Style, it is perfpicuous and 
ejegant through all the Poem: and when 

. he enters into Defcriptlons which Require 
Strength and Majefty, it is wonderful 
how the natural Effeminacy of the ba^ 

liUn. Language, foars up into Sublimity and 
Griandeur, and affumes a new Charafter 
in his hands, if we except about an 
hundred Lines in which he flattens into 
pitiful Conceits ; but I look on thcfe 
Errors as a kind of Tribute, which his 
Genius condefcended to pay to the Italian 

■fafte. 

If his Excellencies challerjge the unani- 

* mous Admiration of Eiir6p there are 
Faults in him which methiims are cen- 

fur'd 



Tur^d every where. The Eprfode of O- 
imdo and Sophrmia m the beginning of 
the Aftion, feems defeftive in all Re- 

The^Poet introduces a Mahometan Ma- 
[ician^ called If mem ; who, againft the. 
trift, and never violated Laws of the Ma- 
^dtnetab Religion, carries an Image of the 
'^rgin Marj into the principal Mofque^ 
in ord^r to mahe it, by the Force of his 
?>ndiantments, the Pledge and Security 
of the Town, as formerly the Fate of 
'Trey depended upon the Palladium. It 
-happws one Night, that the Image is 
"ftokni away, the Chriftians oijerufalem 
-being -fufpefted of the Theft, the Sultan 
incens'd, ftntences them all to Deaths 
that he might be fare to punifli the Guil-

while Sophronia, a pious Chriftian Vir- 
gin, comes bofoi*^ the Sultan. She 
faves her Countrymen b^ a generous 
Lye, ffie declares that fhe hath ftolen the 
Image. The King condemns her to be 
inurnt. Olindo her Lover endeavours to 
fave her Life by another noble Lye ; he 
takes rfie Guilt upon himfelf, and claims 
'the Pile prep^r^d for her. At laft

Source of fo many Beauties. Befides, 
Ihe is a MdhoTnetan, and the Chriftian Re- 
ligion allows us to believe that thofe InH- 
dels are under the immediate Influence of 
the Devil. 

But indeed no body but an Italian can 
bear with the wild Excefs, to which 
T^ajfo hath carried that Machinery. Ten 
Chriftian Princes turned into Fifh in 
the Ponds of Armida^ and a Parrot finging 
amorous Songs of his own making, are 
very ftrange Things in the Eyes of a fe- 
rious Reader, tho' one is precedented by 
the* Story of Gne in Homer ; and tho* 
the Parrots are thought among us to mi- 
mick now and then human Voices. 

Still we fhould eafily forgive fuch po- 
etical Extravagancies for the fake of the 
Beauties which are mingled with them. 
Let the Devils ((ince they are admitted) 
have a free Scope to play their wild 
Pranks, efpecially in Italy^ where the 
Supcrftition of the People brings Credit to 
no lefs ftrange Tales. 

But it is unaccountable, how Men of 
Senfe can approve of the Chriftian Ma- 
gicians, who help Rinaldo out of the hands 
of the Mahometan Wizards. It is Angular,

M'ljat ftvange Fancy ! to fend JJbaldo anit 
his Companion to an old Mj Cottjurer, 
who carries them jw/? imathi Outer of tht 
Earth. The two Kniphts walk there on the 
Baiksofa PJvul^c covered with precious 
Stones of all Kinds. From that Place 
they are font to Jfiakn to an old Woman, 
who carries them Iwifiiy in a little Ship to 
the Canary lilands. Thither they arrive in 
the Name of. God, holding in their 
hards a magick Wand, they perform 
their Ambaffy, they carry Rinaldo back 
with them to the Camp of the Chriftiaos ; 
fertile Army was in need of him. But 
what was the great Exploit which muft 
ncceffarily be perform^ by RwaUo, and 
by hira only ? 

He was deftin'd by Providence, and- 
broupht by Enchantment from the Pike 
of Teneriff to JerufaleTn, in order to cuC 
down fome Trees in a Foreft inhabited by 
Elves and Hcbgoblings. That Foreft is the 
great Machinery of lajfo. It is remarkable, 
that in the former Books God Almighty 
orders his Arch-angel Michael to drive 
down into Hell tlie Devils who were let 
loofe in the Air, railing Storms, and ma- 
naging his Thunders againft the Chri- 
ftians, in favour of the Mahometans. 
Afichael forbids theip ftri£tiy to meddle 

* ' any 



( 87 ) 
any more in thofe Affairs. They obey, 
and plunge into Hell immediately ; but 
foon after the Enchanter Ifmeno recalls 
them out, they find Means to elude the 
Orders of God, and under the pretence 
of fome Jefuitical Diftinftions, they take 
Pofleffion of the Foreft, wherein the 
Chriftians intended to provide the Timber 
neceflary to build a wooden Tower. 

There they aflume innumerable Shapes, 
to frighten away thofe who come to 
cut the Trees. There T'ancred finds his 
ClorinJay after her Death, (hut up in ^ 
Pine, and bleeding for the Blow, which he 
ftrikes at the Root. There Armida peeps 
put of a Myrtle, while (he is fome Miles 
off, in the M,gyptian Army, and totally 
unapprised of her being in two Places ac 
once, tho* flie is the beft Sorcerefs in the 
World. At laft the Prayers of the fkr-- 
mity and the Merit of Rinaldos Contri- 
tion, after his 0>nfeiSon, break the En- 
chantment. 

Methinks it is not very foreign to the 
Purpofe, to fee how differently Lucan 
hath handled, in his Pharfalia^ a Topick 
pretty much of the fame nature. *Ti$

how folid and firong Thoughts excel 
thofe Inventions, which the Crowd calls 
poetical Beauties, and on which wife 
Men look down as Tales fit for Children. 

The yirtuojl in Italy have difputed for 
a long while, and ftill contfcft which of 
the two, Ariofto ovtajfo, deferves the Pre- 
«cdcoc/. But every where elfe the chiefeft 

Exception 



Exception that Men of Uxuietftan<£ii|; 
take to T'affo^ is that of having too mam 
of Ariofio ia him. 'Tajfo feems to have 
been confcious of this Fault. He couki 
not be unfendble that foch wild Fairy 
Tales, at chat time fo much in Fafliioo, 
not in ludj only, but in all Europe^ were 
altogether inconfiftent with the Gravity of 
Epick Poetry : In order to cover this De- 
feft, he printed a Preface, in which he 
pretends that all his Poem is but a Shadow 
and a Type. 

The Army of the Chriftian Princes, 
fays he, reprefents the Body and the 
Soul. Jerufalem the Figure of true Hap- 
pinefs, which cannot be obtained but by 
Labour and Difficulties. Gofredo is the 
Mind, Tancredo, RaimonJo, &c. are the 
Faculties of the Mind. The common Sol- 
diers make up the Limbs of the Body. 
TheDevih are at once figured, and Figures 
{figura i figurato.) Armlda and IfmeuQ arc? 
the Temptations which befiegt our Soal$« 
The Spells and the lUufioiiS of the in- 
chanted Foreft fhadow out the falfe Rea- 
foning (Jalji Syllogifmi) into which our Paf- 
(ions are apt to miflead.us. 

Such is the Key that Tajfo thinks fit to 
give us ^f his Works. He deals with him- 
^If, as the Commentators have done with 
Hi^m^r and Vmil. Tbofe Centkmen dre 

lik« 










like fpccuiative and dully wi(e Politicians, 
wha conftrue the moft inlignificant Aftions 
of great Men, into Defigns of cne greaceft 
Depth and Importance. But T^^To was 
l3ce that Ambal&dor, who having fpent 
all the Time of hrs Ambaffy in Debauchery 
and Riot, wrote to his Mafter that he 
was whoring and drinking for the Service 
of bis Majefty. 

However, the ridiailous Explanation 
which Taff^ gives with fo much Gravity 
of his Extravagancies, cannot impofe upon 
Mankind ; for we no more aHow an Au- 
thor t(^ comment upon himfelf, than a 
Pricft to prophefy of himfdf. 

If the Devils aft va lafj^ the infipid 
part of defpicable Jugglers ; on the? other 
hand, what is relating to Religion, is writ 
with Majefty, and I dare fay in the Spirit 
of Religion itfelf. Nay, Proceffions and 
Litanies, and all the Parts of P^^fffl) Re- 
ligion, which are accounted comical and 
mean in England^ appear in a reverend 
Awefulnefs in that Poem. So prevalent 
is the Art of Poetry when it exerts itfelf 
in its full force, and fo peculiar to it is the 
tower of raifing what is low, and of en- 
larging the Sphere o£ all Things ! 

He is guilty of indulging the inaccurate 

Cuftom of calling the Evil Spirits by tha 

Names of PlutOy AleBo, and of mingling 

- often 



often PjjgM Ideas with Chriflian MytlioK 
logy. A is ftrange that none of the mo- 
dern Poets are &ee from that Fault. It 
feems that our Devils and our Qhriftian 
Hell, have fomethit^ in them low att4 
mean, and muft be rais'd by the Hell of 
the Pagans^ which owes its Dignity to its 
Antiquity. Certain it is, that the Hell 
of the Gofpel is not fo fitted for Poetry as 
that of Homer and Virgil. The Name of 
Ttfiphme founds better than that of JBeet^ 
%ebub ; but with all that, it is as prepo^ 
ilerous in a Poet to bnng Michael and 
Ale£lo together, as in fome Italian and 
Flemifb Painters to have reprefente4 the 
Virgin yif^ry with a Chapelet of Beads 
hangiig at her Girdle,- to have plac'd 
ibme Swifs Guards at the Door of the A- 
partment oi Pharaoh ^ and to have mix'd 
Cannons and Carabines with the ancient 
Arrows in the Battle oiy^fbuah.

AT the End of the fixteenth Century, 
Sfain produced an Efick Poem, fa-

of its Subjed, but ftill more illuftrious 
by the Character of the Author.

!AUnzo of Ereilla y Cmiga^ Gentlemaa 
of the Bed-Chamber to the Emperor Mix* 
itniUany was bred up in the Houfe of Phi^- 
lif the fecond, and fought under his Or- 
ders, at the Battle of St. Quintin, where 
the French were utterly defeated; 

PkiUp^ after fuch a Succefs^ being lefs 
de(i/ous to augment his Glory abroad, 
than to fettle his Afikirs at home, went 
back to Sfain. The young Al(mx,o of £- 
reillay led by an infatiable Avidity of true 
Learning, (I mean of knowing^Men, and 
.of feeing the World) travelled through all 
France y law Italy y Germany ^ and ftay'd a 
long while in England. Wbilft he was 
in London^ he heard fome Provinces of feru 
and Chily had taken Arms againft the 
Spaniards ythtw Conquerors ; which Strug- 
gle for their Liberty, is, by the by, ftild 
Kebeliion by . the Spanijh Authors. His 
Thirft of Glory, and his eager Defire dc 
feeing and doing new and (ingular Things, 
carry'd him, without any hefitation or 
delay,, into thofc Countries. He went 
to Chily y at the head of a few Troops, an^i 
he ftay*d in thefe Parts all the time of the 
War. 

Near the Borders of Chily ^ towards the 
^uthy lies a fmall mountainous Country, 
called Araucana^ inhabited by a Race of 
Mep, ftronger and more fierce, than all 

the Nations of that new World. They 

£>ugh{ 



/ 



fought for their Liberty, linger than ^e 
other Americans^ and were the lafft wjio 
inrcre fubdu'd. Ahnz^ waged againft them 
a t6ilf(.me and danf:erous War, under- 
weht inexpreffibk Hardfliips, faW <^nd 
atchiev'd tlie moft furprifing Deeds, thi 
Prize whereof was only the Honoui*^ of 
reducing feme Rocks and barren Coun- 
tries, in another Hemifphere, to the CrpvrnL 
of Spain. 

Ahnz/)^ in the Courfc of that War, 
conceived fhe Idea to immortalize his Ene- 
mies and himfelf, he was at once the Con^ 
^ucror and the Pbet. tie made ufe <rf 
the Intervals of the War to fing it, and as 
he wanted Paper, he wrote the firft Part^ 
of his Poem upon little Pieces of Leather, 
"which afterwards he had^^uch ado to fct 
Tight, and po bring toget;her. ThePoerii 
is called the Araucana^ from the? Nan^ ttf 
the G)untry. 

It begins with a geographical Account 
of Chily, and with a Defcription of tfeb 
Maiinef s^ and Cuftoros of the People'; fueh 
^ beginning, which woujd bfc qiute fl^ 
and intolerable in any 6ther Poem, is nc>- 
cdTary and not uppleafant in a Subje^ 
where the Scene lies under the other Tro- 
pick, and whierc the Hferoes he writes ot, 
are barbarous Americatis^^ yriho nnift* h^v^ 






Ifbefi'fer everniibiown, if he had not cdn-*

As the Subjeft was qnite new, fo it 
gave birth to new Thoughts. There is 
ont which I prefent to the Readers, both 
ts an Example of Novelty, and aS a Spark 
of the Fire which animated fometimes the 
Author.

" M 6t&, to fee Creatures like Men, with

kr. The firft Aftion of the ArMcdna^ is 
a Quarrel which happened between all the 
barbarous Chiefs^ as m Homer between 
Achilks and ^^imemvon. The Difpute 
was not about a Woman, but about the 
Right of commanding the Army. * Every * 
one of thofe favage Warriors alTumes an 
uncontroul'd Behaviour upon the Con^ 
fcioufnefs of his own Worch ; and at laft 
the Diipute grew fo high, that they were 
ready to fight one againft another, when 
one of the Cafiques called Cdocok^ as old 
as Nefiwy and lefs boafting of himCclf 
than the Grecian^ made the following 
Speech : 

" Cafiques, ye illuftrious Defenders 
of our Country, the vain Defire of 
Empire does not move me to fpeak 
to you. I do not complain that you ^ 
all contend fo eagerly for an H(»K)^ir

^ and (hould adorn my Dc«;tine. ' T is

** Yoke with one Hand, aflaulr the Spa--

in an unprofitable Quarrel, thofe laft 
Drops of Blood of this State, which 
** the Gods have left in it for its Re- 
*' venge. I am not difpleasM, I confefs, 
" to fee the undaunted Haughtinefs of

which 1 blame, heightens the Hopes 
I conceive of our Defigns ,• but let not 
your ill-govern*d Valour prey upon 
itfelf, and deftroy with its own Force, 
the Country you rife to defend- If 
you perfift in your Quarrels, let your 
Swords firft be imbru'd in my Blood, 
already frozen with old Age. I have 
** liv'd too long, Happy is he who dies 
** before his^ Countrymen are unfortu- 
" nate, and unfortunate by their own 
** Fault. Attend then to what I dare 
propofe for your Welfare. Your Va* 
lour, O Cafiques, is equal ; you are 
all equally illuftrious by the Honours

" Power and Riches ; your Souls are

** Charge ; then fince there is no Dif- ^ 
" ference between your Courages, let 
** the Strength of the Body decide what 
" the Equality of your Virtues would 
" keep undecided for ever, &c.*' 

Then that old Man propofes a Game, 
fit only for a barbarous Nation, and con- 
fequently very proper. It was co carry 
a ponderous Beam, and he who could 
fuftain the Weight longeft, was to be 
the Chief. 

Now fince the beft Way of improving 
our Tafte,\^s that of comparing together 
Things of the fame nature, let us bring * 
in the Difcourfe of Neftor^ in oppofitioa 
to this of Colocoloy and laying afide that 
Worlhip, which our Minds juftly pre- 
judiced, pay to the great Name of Homer, 
Ipt the Reader weigh the two Speeches in 
the Ballance of Equity and Reafon. 

As foon as Achihs warn'd and in- 
fpir'd by Minerva, the Goddefs of Wif- 
dom, has called Agamemnon Drunkard^ 
Dog, and Stag, the wife Neftor arofe to 
calm the ruffled Minds of thofe Heroe$ i 
and among other Things which I i 
wave, to come dofeJy to the Point of 

Com-

Comparifon, thus he faid ; ^^ What a Sa- 
** tisiadtion will it be to the Trojans^ 
*^ when they hear of your Diflenfions ! 
'' Young Men, you muft refpeft my 
*' Years, and fubmit to my Wifdom ; I 
*' have liv*d in my Youth with Heroes, 
** by far fuperior to you ; no, my Eyes 
** will never fee fuch Men, as the un- 
** daunted Pirithous^ the bold CeneuSy the 
" divine Thefeus, Sec. I went to war 
" with them, and though younger, I 
** fway*d their Strength by my perfua- 
*' five Eloquence ; they liftned to, they 
" obey'd Nejior. If in my early Years 
*^ they deemM me fo wife ; you, young 
" Warriors, attend to the Advice of 
*^ my old Age. Atrides^ do not feize oa 
** the Slave of Achilles ; you Son of T'he^ 
** tisj do not treat our Prince with 
^ Pride. Achilles is the greateft, the moft 
** courageous of the Warriors, Agamemmn 
" is the greateft of Kings, &c'* Thus 
fpoke the wife Neflor^ and his Speech 
prov'd entirely ineffeftual, for Agamemmn 
commended his Eloquence, and negledied 
the Advice. 

Let the Readers confider on one part, 
the Endearments by which the barba- 
tous Cohcolo ingratiates himfelf into the 
Favour of the Cafiques, the awful Ma-^ 
jefty with which he checks their Animo-^ 
fity, the Tcndcrncfs with which te fc* 

G 2 tens 



tens their Boifteroufnefs, how the Love 
of his Country animates him, how the 
true Senfe of Glory enlivens his Speech, 
in what a prudent manner he praifes 
their Valour, when he curbs their Fu- 
ry ; with what Art, he gives Superiority 
to none, and is at the fame time an in- 
«»6fenfive Cenfor, and a noble Panegyrift : 
So that all fubmit to his Reafon, and 
comply with his Advice, confeffing the 
Force of his Eloquence, not by empty 
Commendations, but by a fudden Obe- 
dience. 

On the other fide, one may judge, if 
Nefior is fo wife in talking £o much of 
his Wifdom, if it is a good Way to re-r 
concile the Attention of the (?rf ^ Prin-« 
ces, by telling them that they are by far 
inferior to their Fore-fachers ; if to fay 
to Agamemnon^ that Achilles \s the moft 
valorous of the prefent Chiefs, ought to 
be very acceptable to Agamemnon ; and 
after having comparM the haughty Talka-« 
tivenefs of Nefior^ with the modeft E- 
loquence cf Colocolo ; the Injury ofiered 
by one to all the Greeks^ by the offenfive

Courage, artfully extoird in all the Ca- 
fiques : Tiien let the Reader pronounce. 
And if there is a General in the World, 
who would hear his Inferior preferred to 
him in point of Courage ; if there is any 
Affembly who would bear without Re- 
fentmenr, a Speaker talking to them- with 
Contempt, and villifying them, by ex* 
tolling at their Expence their Predecef- 
fors 3 let then Homer be preferred to Alon-^ 
Z.0 in that Particular. 

It is true, that if AlonzA) is above Homer 
in this Point, he is in all the reft inferior to 
the meaneft of the Poets. It is wonderful, 
how he falls fo low from fo high a Flight. 
There is undoubtedly a great deal of Fire 
in his Battles, but no Deiign, no Invention, 
no Variety in the Defcriptions, no Uni 
ty in the whole Frame ; the Poem i 
more wild, than the Nations who ar 
the Subjeft of it. In the latter End c 
the Work, Alonzo^ who is one of the 
chief Aftors in the Poem, makes a long 
ai]d tedious March with fome Soldiers 
by Night ; and to divert the Time, he 
raifes a Difpute between them about Vir^ 
gil, and chiefly on the Epifode of Dido. 
Alonz.0 takes his Opportunity, in the 
Converfation, of relating the Hiftory of 
Dido, as it is reponed by fome antienc 
Authors.; and in order to give the Lye 
to T^rgil, and to reftore Dido to her for- 

G 3 mcr 



( 102 ) 

mer Glory, he fpends two long Canto's in 
dcfcanting upon her. 

One of the greateft Exceptions befides, 
which may be taken againft it, is, that the 
Book conlifts of thirty-fix long Canto's. 
The Reader will think it probable, thart 
a Man who does not know how to ftop, 
is not qualified to run fuch a Career. 

So many Defefts have not deterred the 
celebrated Michael Cervantes from writing, 
that the Araucana may cope with the beft 
Authors of Italy. 

The Judgment of Cervantes was mif-led 
in that Point by an over- weaning Incli- 
nation towards his Countrymen^ The true 
Love of our Country is to do good to it, 
to contribute to its Liberty, as far as it 
lies in our power ; but to contend only for 
the Superiority of our Authors, to boaft 
of having among us better Poets than our 
Neighbours, is rather Self-love than Pa- 
triot ifm. 

MILTON. 

MILTO N is the laft in Europe who 
wrote an Efick Poem ^ for I wave 
all thofe whofe Attempts have been un- 
^ifuccefsful, my Intention being not to de- 
fcant on the many who have contended 
for the Prize, but to Ipcak only of the 

very 



( i03 ) 

Very few who have gaind it in their re- 
fpeftive Countries. 

Milton^ us he was travelling through W 
Italy in his Youth, faw at Florence a Co- 
medy caird AdnmOy writ by one Andreim a 
Player, and dedicated to Mary de Media's 
Queen of France. The Subjcdl of the 
Play was the Fall of Man ; the Aftors, 
God, the Devils, the Angels, Adam^ Eve^ 
the Serpent, Death, and the feven mortal 
Sins. That Topick fo improper for a Dra- 
ma, but fo fuitable to the abfurd Genius 
of the Italian Stage, (as it was at that 
time) was handled in a manner intirely 
conformable to the Extravagance of the 
Defign. The Scene opens with a Chorus 
of Angels, and a Cherubim thus fpeaks 
for the reft : " Let the Rainbow be the 
'' Fiddleftick of the Fiddle of the Hea- 
" vens, let the Planets be the Notes of 
*^ our Mufick, let Time beat carefully the 
** Meafure, and the Winds make the 
" Sharps, &c.^ Thus the Play begins, 
and every Scene rifes above the firtt in 
Prof ufion of Impertinence. 

Milton pierc'd through the Abfurdity of 
that Performance to the hidden Majefty 
of the Subjed, which being altogether 
unfit for the Stage, yet might be (for the 
Genius of Milton^ and for Ihs only) the 
Foundation of an E^ick Poem. 

G 4 H# 



( 104 ) 

He to<*k from that ridiculous Trifle 
the firft Hint of the nobleft Work, which 
human Imaf^ination hath ever attempted, 
and vviiich he executed more than twen- 
ty Years after. I 

In the like manner, Pythagoras ow'd the 
Invention of Mufick to the Noife of the 
Hammer of a Blackfmith. And thus in our 
Days, Sir Ifaac Newton walking in his 
Gardens, had the firft Thought of his 
Syftem of Gravitation, upon feeing an 
Apple falling from a Tree. 

If the Diflference of Genius between 
Natic n and Nation, ever appeared in its full 
Light, *tis in Milton's Paradife Loft. 

The French anfwer with a fcornful 
Smile, when they are told there is in 
England an Epick Poem, the Subjeft 4 
wiieieof is the Devil fighting againft 
God, and j4dam and Eve eating an Ap- 
ple at the Perfuafion of a Snake. As 
that Topick hath afforded nothing among 
them, but fome lively Lampoons, for 
which that Nation is fo famous ; 
they cannot imagine it poflible to build 
an Epick Poem upon the Subjedl of their 
Ballads. And indeed fuch an Error 
ought to be excufed ; for if we confider 
with what Freedom the politeft Part of 
Mankind throughout all Europe^ both 
Catholicks and Proteftants, are wont to ^ 
ridicule in Converfation thofc confecratcd 

Hifto- 



^ 



( I05 ) 

Hiftorics ; nay, if thofe who have the 
higheft Refpeft for the Myfteries of the 
Chriftian Religion, and who are ftruck 
with Awe at lome Parts of it, yet cannot 
forbear now and then making free with 
the Devil^ the Serpent^ the Frailty of our 
firft Parents, the Rib which Adam was 
robb'd of^ and the like ; it feems a very 
hard Task for a profane Poet to endea- 
vour to remove thofe Shadows of Ri- 
dicule, to reconcile together what is di- 
vine, and what looks abfurd, and to com- 
mand a Refpeft that the Sacred Writers 
could hardly obtain from our frivolous 
Minds. 

What Milton Co boldly undertook, he 
performed with a fuperior Strength of 
Judgment, and with an Imagination pro- 
duftive of Beauties not dream'd of before 
him. The Meannefs (if there is any) of 
fome Parts of the Subjeft, is loft in the 
Immenfity of the poetical Invention. There 
is fomething above the reach of human 
Forces to have attempted the Creation 
without Bombaft, to have defcrib'd the 
Gluttony and Curiofity of a Woman with- 
out Flatnefs, to have brought Proba- 
bility and Reafon amidft the hurry of 
imaginary Things belonging to another 
World, and as far remote from the Limits 
of our Notions, as they are from our 
Earth ; in Ihort, to force the Reader to 

fay, 



^^ 



( 106) 

fay, ** If God, if the Angels, if Satan 
" would fpeak, I believe they would 
*' fpeak as they do in Milton.'* 

1 have often admir'd how barren the 
Subjed appears, and how fruitful it grows ^ 

under his hands. 

The Paradife Lofty is the only Poem 
wherein are to be found, in a perfeft de- 
gree, that Uniformity which fatisfies the 
Mind, and that Variety which pleafes the 
Imagination : All its Epifodes being ne- 
ceflfary Lines, which aim at the Centre of 
a pcrteft Circle. Where is the Nation 
who would not be pleasM with the Inter- 
view of v^^Ai»f and the Angel? With the ^r 
Mountain of Vifion, with the bold Strokes 
which make up the relentlefs, undaunted, 
and fly Charafter of Satan ? But above * 
all, with that fublime Wifdom which 
Mihon exerts, whenever he dares to de- 
fer) be God, and to make him fpeak ? He 
leems indeed to draw the Pifture of the 
Almighty as like as Human Nature can 
reach to, through the monal Duft in 
which we are clouded. 

The Heathens always, the Jews often, 
and our Chriftian Priefts fometimes, re- 
prefent God as a Tyrant infinitely power- 
ful. But the God of Milton is always a 
Creator, a Father, and a Judge ; nor is < 

his Vengeance jarring with his Mercy, 

nor 



C 107 ) 

nor Ws Predetermioations repugnant to 
the Liberty of Man. Thefe are the Pic- 
tures which lift up indeed the Soul of the 
Reader. Milton in that Point, as well as 
in many ^thers, is as far above the ancient 
Poets, as the Chriftian Religion is ^bovc 
the Heathen Fables. 

But he hath efpecially an indifputable 
Claim to the unanimous Admiration of 
Mankind, when he defcends from thofe 
high Flights to the natural Defcription of 
human Things. It is obfervable, that in 
all other Poems, Love is reprefented as a 
Vice, in Milton only 'tis a Virtue. The 
Piftures he draws of it, are naked as 
the Perfons he fpeaks of, and as venera- 
ble. He removes with a chafte hand, the 
Veil which covers every where elfe the 
Enjoyments of that Paffion. There is 
Softnefs, Tendemefs, and Warmth, with- 
out Lafcivioufnefs ; the Poet tranfports 
himfelf and us into that State of inno- 
cent Happinefs, in which Adam and Eve 
continued for a ftiort time. He foars not 
above human, but above corrupt Nature ; 
and as there is no Inftance of fuch Love, 
there is none of fuch Poetry. 
1 How then it came to pafs that the 
Paradife Lofi had been fo long neglefted, 
(nay, almoft unknown) in England, (till 
the Lord Sommers, in fomc meafure, taught 

Mankind 



C io8 ) 

Mankind to admire it) is a Thing Mrhkh 
I cannot reconcile, neither ^ with the Tem- 
per, nor with the Genius of the Effgltjh 
Nation. 

The Duke of Buckingham in- bis Art 
of Poetry gives the Preference tA Spencer, 
It is reported in the Life of the Lord Ro- 
cheftery that he had no Notion of a better 
Poet than Cowley. 

Mr. Dry dens Judgment on Milton is 
ftill more unaccountable. He hath be- 
ftow*d fome Verfes upon him, in which 
he puts him upon a Level with, nay above 
Virgil and Homer ; 

The Force of Nature could no further go j 
To make a third, /he join d the former two. 

The fame Mr. Dryden, in his Preface 
upon his Tranflaiion of the ^neid, ranks 
Milton with ChapeDainy and Lemoine, the 
moft impertinent Poets who ever fcribbled. 
How he could extol him fo much in his 
Verfes, and debafe him fo low in his Profe, 
is a Riddle, which, being a Foreigner, I 
cannot underftand. 

In fliort, one would be apt to think, 
that Atikon had not obtained his true Re- 
putation, till Mr. Addifon, the beft Critick, 
as well as the beft Writer of his Age, 
pointed out the moft hidden Beauties of 
the Paradife Loft ; and fettled for ever its 
Reputation. 

It 



< 



( 109 ) 

It is an eafy and a pleafant Task to take 
notice of the many Beauties of AC/rtii, which 
I call univerfal : But 'tis a ticklifli Under* 
taking, to point out what would be repu- 
ted a Fault in any other Country. 

I am very far from Thinking, that one 
Nation ought to judge of its Produdtions 
by the Standard of another ; nor do I pre- 
fume, that the French (for Example) who 
have no Epick Poets, have any Right to 
give La ws on Epick Poetry. 

But I fancy many Englijh Readers, who 
are acquainted with the French Language^ 
will not be difpleas'd to have fome No- 
tion of the Tafte of that Country : And I 
hope they are too juft either to fubmit to 
it, or defpife it barely upon the fcorc of 
its being foreign to them. 

Would each Nation attend a little 
more than they do, to the Tafte and the 
Manners of their relpeftivc Neighbours, 
perhaps a general good Tafte might dif- 
fufe itfelf through all Europe from fuch 
an Intercourfe of Learning, and from 
that ufeful Exchange of Obfervations. 
The Englifh Stage, for Example, might 
be ciear'd of mangled CarcafTes, and the 
Style of their tragick Authors come 
down from their forced Metaphorical 
Bombaft, to a nearer Imitation of Nature. 
The French would learn from the EngUfl> 
tp animate their Tragedies with more 

Ac- 



( 110 ) 

Aftion, and wcaild concraf): now and then 
their long Speeches into fhorter and warmer 
Sentiments. 

- The SpamArds would introduce in their 
Plays more Pidures of human Life, more 
Charadlers and Manners, and not puzzle 
themfelres always in the Entanglements of 
confus'd Adventures, more romantick 
than natural. The Italian in point of Tra- 
gedy, would catch the Flame from the 
EngUjh, and all the reft from the French^ 
In point of- Comedy, they would learn 
from Mr. Congreve and fonw other Authors, 
to prefer Wit and Humour to Buflfoonery. 

To proceed in that View ; Til venture 
to fay, that ncme of the French Criricks 
could like the £xcur(ions which Milton 
makes fometimes beyond the ftrift Li- 
mits of his Subjeft. They lav down for 
a Rule, that an Author himfelt ought ne- 
ver to appear in his Poem, and his own 
Thoughts, his own Sentiments, muft be 
fpoken by the Aftors he introduces. Ma- 
ny judicious Men in England comply with 
that Opinion, and Mr. Addifon favours it* 
I beg leave in this place to hazard a Re- 
flexion of my own, which I fubmit to the 
Reader's Judgment. 

Milton breaks the Thread of his Nar-^ 
ration in two Manners. The firft con-' 
Cfts of two or three kinds of Prologues, 

which

(in) 

which he premifes ac the beginping of 
fome Books. In one place he expatiates 
upon his own Blindnefs; in another he 
compares his Subjefl, and prefers it to 
that of the Iliad, and to the common To- 
picks of War, which were thought before 
him the only Subjeft fit for Efick Poetry ; 
and he adds, that he hopes to foar as high 
as all his PredecelTors, unlefs the cold Cli- 
mate of England damps Us livings. 

His other way of interrupting his Nar- 
ration, is by fome Obfervations which he 
interfperfes now and then upon fome great 
Incident, or fome interefting Circumftancc. 
Of that kind is his Digreffion on Love, in 
the fourth Book ; 

Whatever Hypocrites aufterely talk, 
Defaming as impure , what God declares 
Pure, and commands to fome, leaves free to alli 
Our Maker bids increafe, who bids abftain 
But OUT Difirojer^ Foe to God and Men f 
Hail wedded l/^ve, tec. 

As to the firft of thefe two Heads, I 
cannot but own that an Author is gene- 
rally guiltv of an unpardonable Self-love, 
when he lays^afide his Subject to defcant 
on his own Perfon : but that human 
Frailty is to be forgiven in Milton • nay, 
I am pleas'd with it. He gratifies tte 
Curiofity it raiies in me about his Pe/- 
fon i when I admire the Author, I defire 

to 



(112) 

to know fomcthing of the Man j and he 
whom all Readers would be glad to know, 
is allowM to fpeak of himKlf . But this 
however is a very dangerous Example for 
a Genius of an inferior Order, and is only 
to be juftified by Succefs. 

As to the fecond Point, I am fo far 
from looking on that Liberty as a Fault, 
that I think it to be a great Beauty. For 
if Morality is the Aim of Poetry, I do not 
apprehend why the Poet fliould be forbid- 
den to interfperfe his Defcriptions with 
moral Sentences and ufeful Refleftions, 
provided he fcatters them with a fparing 
nand, and in proper places, either when 
he wants Perfonages ' to utter thofe 
Thoughts, or when their Charadler does 
not permit them to fpeak in the behalf of 
Virtue. 

Tis ftrange that Homer is commended 
by the Criticks for his comparing Ajax 
to an Afs pelted away with Stones by 
fome Children, Vlyjfes to a Pudding, the 
Council-board of Priam to Graflioppers : 
*Tis ftrange, I fay, that they defend fo 
clamoroufly thofe Similes , tho* never fo 
foreign to the purpofe, and will not allow 
the natural Refledions, the noble Digref- 
fions of Milton^ tho* never fo clofely linked 
to the Subjc6t 

I will not dwell upon fome fmall Errors 
of Mihn, which are obvious to every 

Reader i 



( "3 ) . 

Reader ; I mean fome few Contradic- 
tions, and thofe frequent Glances at the 
Heathen Mythology : which Fault, by the 
by, is fo much the more inexcufable in 
hirt, by his having premised in his firft 
Book, that thofe Divinities were but De- 
vils worlliippM under different Names, 
which ought to have been a fufRcient 
Caution tohim not to fpeak of the Rape of 
Proferpine^ of the Wedding of Juno* and 
yupiteir^ &c. as Matters of Faft. 

1 lay alide likewife his prcpofterous and 
aukward Jefts, his Puns, his too familiar 
Expreffions, fo inconfiftent with the Eleva- 
tion of his Genius, and of his Subjedl. 

To come to more effeatial Points and 
more liable to be debated : I dare affirm, 
that the Contrivance of the Pandamonium 
would have been entirely difapprov'd of by 
Criticks like Boileau, Racine^ &c. 

That Seat built for the Parliament of 
the Devils, feems very prepofterous: 
Since Satan hath fummonM them altoge- 
ther, and haranguM them juft before in 
an ample Field. The Council was ne- 
ceffary ; but where it was to be held, 
W^i very ihdifferent. The Poet feems 
to delight in Building his Pandamonium 
in boric Order with Freeze and Cornice, 
and a Roof of Gold. Such a Contri- 
vance favours more of the wild Fancy 
of our father le Moine^ than of the fe- 
ll • rious 




'Hit

( "4) 

rious Spirit of Mlton. But when after- 
wards the Devils turn Dwarfs to fill their 
Places in the Houfe, as if it was imprae- 
ticable to build a Room large enough to 
contain them in their natural Size ; ic 
is an idle Story^ which would match the 
moft extravagant Tales* And to crown 
all, Satan, and the chief Lords preferving 
their own monftrous Forms, while the 
Rabble of the Devils flirink into Pig- 
mies, heightens the Ridicule of the 
whole Contrivance to an unexpreflible 
degree. Methinks the true Criterion 
for difcerning what is really ridiculous 
in an Efick Poem, is to examine if the 
fame thing would not fit exafUy the 
Mock-Heroick. Then I dare fay that no- 
thing is fo adapted to that ludicrous way 
of Writing, as the Metamorphoiis of the 
Devils into Dwarfs. 

The Fidion of Death and iiu, feems 
to have in it fome great Beauties, and ma-^ 
ny grofs Defe&s. In order to canvafs this 
Matter with Order, we muft firft lay 
down, that fuch fliadowy Beings^ as 
Deaths Sin, Chaos, arc intolerable, when 
they are not aUegorfcai. For Fiftion is 
nothing but Truth in Difguife. It muft 
be granted too, that an Allegory muft be 
ihort, decent, and noble. For an Allega* 
ry carried too far or too low^ is like a 
beautiful Woman who wears always a 

Mask. 



^1-.

( 115 ) 

Mask. An Allegory is a long Metaphor ; 
and to fpeak too long in Metaphors muft 
be tirefome, becaufe unnatural. This be- 
ing premisM, I muft fay, that in general 
thoie Fi<5lions, thofe imaginary Beings^ 
arc more agreeable to the Nature of A//7- 
tott's Poem, than to any other ; becaufe 
he hath but two natural Perfons foi^ 
his AAoxSy I mean Adam and Eve, A 
great part of the Aft ion lies in imagi- 
nary Worlds, and muft cfcourfe admit of 
imaginary Beings. 

Then Sin fpringing out of the Head 
of Satan^ feems a beautiful Allegory of 
Pride, which is looked upon as the firft 
Ofience committed againft God. But I 
queftion if Satan, getting his Daughter 
with Child, is an Invention to be ap- 
proved of I am afraid that Fiftion is 
but a meer Quibble ; for if Sin was of a 
mafculine Gender in Englijh, as it is in aU 
the other Languages, that whole ASsHt 
drops, and the Fiftion vaniflies away« 
But fuppofe we are not £b nice, and we al- 
low Satan to be in love with Sin, becaufe 
this Word is made feminine in Engliih (as 
Death paiTesalfo for mafculine) what a 
horrid and loathfbme Idea does Mkon pre^ 
fent to the Mind, in this Fiftion? Sin 
brings forth Death, this Monfter inSam'd 
with Luft and Rage, lies with his Mother, 
as Ae. had ^pc with her Father. From 

H 2 chac 



(lis) 

thtt new Commerce, fprings a Swflrrri of 
Serpents, which creep in and out of their 
Mother's Womb, and gnaw and tear the 
Bowels they are born from. 

Let fuch a Picture be never fo beauti- 
fully drawn, let the Allegory be never 
fo obvious, and fo clear, ftill it will be 
intolera*ble, on the account of its Foul- 
nefs. That Complication of Horrors, 
that Mixture of Inceft, that Heap of 
Monfters, that Loathfomenefs fo far 
fetch'd, cannot but Chock a Reader of de- 
licate Tafte. 

But what is more intolerable, there 
are Parts in that Fidtion, which bearing 
no Allegory at all, have no manner of 
Excufe. There is no Meaning in the 
Communication between Death and Sin, 
Vis diftafteful without any Purpofe; or 
if any Allegory lies under it, the filthy 
Abomination of the Thing is certainly 
more obvious than the Allegory. 

I fee with Admiration, Sin^ the Por* 
trefs of Hell, opening the Gates of the 
Abyfs, but unable to (hut them again : 
That is really beautifbl, becaufe 'tis true. 
But what fignifies Satan and Death quar-* 
relling together, grinning at one another^ 
iand ready to fight? 

The Fiaion of Chaos, Night, and Di/- 
cordy is rather a Pifture, than an Alle- 
gory ; and, for ought I know, de&rnes

tofaeapprovM, becaufe it ftrikcs the Rea^ 
der with Awe, not with Horror. 

I know the Bridge built by Death and 
Sin, would be diflik'd in France. The 
nice Critjcks of that Country would urge 
agtinft that Fi<5lion, that it leems too com- 
mon, and that it is ufelefs ; for Men's 
Souls want no paved Way, to be thrown 
into Hell, after their Separation from the 
Body. 

They would laugh juftly at the Para- 
dife of Fools, at the Hermits, Fryars, 
Cowls, Beads, Indigencies, Bulls, Re- 
liques tofs*d by the Winds, at St. Peter- s 
waiting with his Keys at the Wicket of 
Heaven. And furely the moft paiEonate 
Admirers of Milton^ could not vindicate 
thofe low, comical Imaginations, which 
belong by Right to Ariofio. 

Now the fublimeft of all the Fiftions 
calls me to examine it. I mean the War 
in Heaven. The Earl of RofcotntHM^ and 
Mr.AddifQn (whofe Judginent feems ei- 
ther to guide, or to jumfy the Opinion 
dF his Qountrymen) admire chiefly that 
Part of the Poem. They beftow all the 
Skill of their Criticifm, and the Strength 
of their Eloquenice, to fet otf that favou- 
rite Part. I may affirm, that the very 
Things they admire, would not be tole^- 
rated by the Fremb Criticks. The Rea- 
der will perhaps fee with Pleafure, m 

H 3 ^ tvhae 



("8) 

v)bm coufifti fo firat^t a Dlfferemt^ and 
what may be the Ground of it. 

Firft, they would aflfert, that a War in 
Heaven being an imaginary Thing, which 
lies out of the Reach of our Nature, fliould 
be contracted in two or three Pages, ra- 
ther than lengthen^ out into two Books ; 
becaufe we are naturally impatient of re- 
moving from us the Obje^ which are not 
adapted to our Senfes. 

According to that Rule, they would 
maintain, ttait it is gn idle Task to give 
the Reader the full Charadler of the Lea^ 
ders of that War, and ter defcribe Aa- 
fbael^ MichaAy Abdiel^ Moloch^ and Nif" 
tfttby as Htmer paints Ajax^ Diomede^ and 
He£{or. 

For what avails it to draw at length 
the Praure of chefe Beings, fo utterly 
Strangers to the Reader, that he cannot 
be aftedted any way towards them ? By 
the fame Reafon, the long Speeches of 
thefe imaginary Warriors, either before 
the Battle, or in the Middle of the A^n, 
their mutual Infaks, feeman injudicious 
Imitation oi Homer. 

The aforefaid Criticks would not bear 
with the Angels plucking up the Moun- 
tains, with their Woods, their Waters, 
and their Rocks, and flinging them on 
the heads of their Enemies. Such a 
Contrivance (they would fay) \% the 

mor«

(119) 

m0tt puerile, the more it aims at Great- 
Bcfs. Angels arm^d with Mountains in 
Heaven, refemble too much the Dipfodes 
in RaMais, who wore an Armour of 
Pmland Stont fix Foot thick. 

The Artijlery feems of the fame kind, 
yet more trifling, becaufe more ufelefs. 

To what purpofe are thefe Engines 
brought in ? Since they cannot wound 
the Enemies, but only remove them from 
their Places, and make them tumble 
4own : Indeed (if the Expreffion may be 
forgiven) *tis to play at Nine-pins. And 
the very Thing which is fo dreadfully 

freat on Earth, becomes very low and ri- 
iculous in Heaven. 

I cannot omit here, the viable Contra- 
diftion which reigns in that Epifode. God 
tmds his faithful Angels to fight, to con- 
quer, and to punifh the Rebels. Go ((ays 
^e, to SiSchael stxid Oabriei) 



^And to the Brow of Heaven 



Purfinngy drive them out from God and Blifs, 
Into their Place of Puni/hment, the Gulfh 
Of Tartarus, vshich ready of ens wide 
ISs fiery Chaos to receive their Faff. 

Haw does it come to pafs, after fuch 
a pofitive Order, that the Battle hangs 
doubtful ? And why did God the Fa- 
ther command Gabriel and Raphael, to

I leave ic to the Readers, to pronounce^ 
if thefe Obfervations are right, or ill- 
grounded, and if they are carried too far. 
Bur in cdl'e thefe Exceptions are juft, the 
ievereft Critickmuft however confefs, th^re 
are Perfcftions enough in Milton^ toattone 
for all his Defefts. 

I muft beg leave to conclude this Article 
on Milton^ with two Obfervations. 

His Hero (I mean Adam^ his hrft Per- 
fonage) is unhappy. That demonftrates 
againft all the Criticks, that a very good 
Poem may end unfortunately, in fpight 
of all their pretended Rules. Secondly, 
The Paradife Loft ends compleatly. .The 
Thread of tht Fable is fpun out to the 
laft. Milton and Ti/T© bftve been careful 
of not flopping fhort and abruptly. The 
one does not abandon Adam and Eve^ 
till they are driven out of Eden. The 
other does not conclude, before Jerufa^ 
lent is taken. Homer and Virgil took a 
contrary Way; the Iliad ends with the 
Death of HeUor ; the ^neidy with that of 
Turnus : The Tribe of Commentators 
have upon that ena&ed a Law, that 
a Houfe ought never to be finifli'd, be- 
caufe Homer and yirgil did not compleat 
their own ; but if Homer had taken Tro;^, 
' i^ad yirgil married Lavinia to jEneas^ 

the 



i 



( «I ) 

the Cricicks would have laid down'^a Rule 
|ufl: the contrary. 

Was J fwayM by the cpmmon Aflfec- 
tation of commending our native Coun- 
try abroad, I would endeavour \n this 
place, to fet off, to the beft, Advantage, 
fome of our Efkk Poems ; but I. muft 
fmnkly own, among more than fifty 
which I have read, there is not one to- 
lerable. Then inftead of throwing away an 
unavailable Criticifm upon fome wretched 
French Poem, I am reduced to inquire why 
we have not a good one ; for it feems a 
Kttle ftrange, that a Nation who boafts of 
having fucceeded fo well in all the other M0f^ 
Parts of Poetry, falls fo fliort of herfelf 
in tfaiat Particular. ^ 

J have heard the French Tongue ar- 
raigned in England of Infufficiencyi as 
being neither ftrong nor lofey enough to 
reach the Sublimity of Epick Poetry. 

I am apt to think, that every Lan- 

fuage has its own particular Genius, 
owing chiefly from the Genius of the 
Nation, and partly from its own Na- 
ture. 

On the one fide, more or iefs Liberty 
in the Government, and in Religion, a 
Biore or Iefs free G)nverfation betweea 
the two Sexes, the Influence of the firft 
Authors who have written with Suc-

( "a ) 

cefsj und whofe Sdle is become the ge*- 
neral Standard, all tbefe Means have a 
great fhare m determining the Hature of 
a Language, in making it extenlife or 
ftinted, ftrong or weak^ fublime or fow. 
. On the other fide, the Roughnefs <^ 
too many Confonanc% the Softnefs of 
predominant Vowels, the Length or the 
ShoFtnefs of the Words, more or lefs Ar- 
ticles, and the like, give a ftrong Biafs to 
an Idiom, and render it ntore or lefs 
i^ceptible of fome particular ways of 
writing. 

Thus if we confider the Softnefs ami 
inacy into which the Luxuriancy of 

owels emafculates the haliam Tongue^ 

id the Idlenefs in which the hiJtam 
^^cnd all their Life, b\ify onlv in the 
purfuit of thofe Arts which u)ften the 
Mind ; we muft not wonder if that Lan- 
guage paflfes (as it were) for the Lan* 
guage of Love. 

The Freedom of Society in F^ance^ and 
the Turn of the Phrafes, which, as they 
admit of no Tranfpofition, are the mors 

?errpicuouS| qualify exceedingly tiitFrencb 
i'ongue |or Converfatton. The fomier 
Rou^n^ of the Engl^ language, now 
improved. into Strength and Energy i its 
Copioulheis, its admitting of many inver- 
fion^ lit it for more fublime Perfbrmances. 
Bifides, the Force of tha^ Uiom is won- 
derfully

dcrfully heigfaten'd^ by the Nature of the 
Governmetic, which allows the Englifb ta 
fpeak in piift>lk:k, and by the Liberty of 
Confidence^ which makes them more am-- 
verfant in the Scripture, and hath render- 
ed the Language of the Prophets fo fami- 
liar to them, that their Poetry favours 
very much of that Eaftem out-of-the-way 
SubMmity ; nay, fixty or eighty Years ago, 
all the Speeches in Parliament were cram- 
med yfnth Expreflions taken from the 
Jinbifi Writings. But fuch predominant 
Qualifications of a Language, do not im- 
ply an Exclufion of any other Aptitude in 
it. Lofty Perfbrmances have been made 
in baliM. Some Engli/h Poets have writ- 
ten gracefully upon Love, and it . is not 
impoflible for the French to have an E^ck 

Poem. 

The French Tongue has Strength and 
Majefiy enough in CorneHle^s Tragedies* 
Nay, now and then it ibars up in his 
Plays beyond the true Meafure of Sub- 
lime. Far from wanting Force or Gran- 
deur, I dare affirm it labours under a 
contrary DefeA. And this is a Secret 
which I unfold willingly. We can hardly 
exprels common Things with Felicity 
in our Heroick Poetry. The Genius of 
the Nation, and donfequently the Turn 
of the Lai^uage, does not aUow us to 

come 



( "4 ) 

come down to the Defcription of the 
Trappings of a Horfe, of the Wheels 
of a Chariot, tXc. We can commend 
roral Life in general, but not fpecify, 
with Dignity, the little Particularities 
belongine to it. This Task is avoided by 
all our sfcilful Writers, who are confcious 
of the Defe£Hvenefs of the Language in 
that refpeA. It Ihort, fuch is our l>if- 
advantage, that there is an infinite Numr 
bcr of ThingSj which we dare neither 
call by their Names, nor exprefs by a Be- 
riphrafe. Mr. Pofey in his Tranflation of 
Homer^ may vnthout any rifque, wound a 
Hero, v)ljere the Bone and the Bladder 
meet^ or pierce him through the right 
Shoulder. He may fay after bis Ori- 
ginal: 

■ ' ^ the Dart p ierced a vital Part^ 
Full in hit Pace it entered^ and betwixt 
T))e Nofe^ and the Eye-Ball, the prmd Lician 

[M 

Crafi^d all his Jaws, and cleft the Tongue 

[within. 
Till the bright Point looked out beneath the, 

ZChin. 

The like Attempt in French, would be 
thought Burlefque. The Fields of Na- 
ture lie wide and open for the Eng/lijh 
to range through at pleasure, whilft wc 

are 



i 



are ftinted and obligM to walk with too 
much Circumfpedion. 

To rfiis happy Freedom, that the JBri- 
tijb Nation enjoys in every Thing, are 
owing many excellent poetical Verfions of 
the ancient Poets ; whereas the French are 
reduced to tranflate Virgil^ Horner^ Lucre- 
tius^ and Ovid^ in Profe. 

Mr. de la Motte^ a Member of the French 
Academy, is the only Man of fome Repu- 
tation, who attempted the Iliad in Vcrfe ; 
but he was forced to contraft the four 
and twenty Books of Homer into twelve, 
yet thofe twelve do not contain fo many 
Verfes as four Books of Homer do. His 
Ili)id is a fliort Abridgment of the Greeks 
and yet is judged to be exceedingly too 
long. 

After all, if that Slavery, if that Goy- 
nefs of the French Language, makes it 
unfit for tranflating Homer and yirgil^ 
yet I do not perceive how that fhould 
hinder the Nation from having an Epick 
Toem of her own Growth ? 

A Poem, methinks, might fubfift very 
well without the help of mechanick, 
or anatomical Defcriptions. We rather 
require of an Author to excite our Paf- 
fions, to unfold the moft intricate Re- 
ceffes of the Soul, to defcribe the Cu- 
ftoms of the Nations, to mark the Dif- 
- £ercnces which arife in the CharaAers of 

Men, 



Men^ from the dififerent Governmentff 
they are born under ; in fliort, to fpeak 
the Language of the polite World ; than 
to play the Surgeon, the Carpenter^ or 
the joiner, though never fo elegantly. ^ 

Cardinal de Bjns^ and the Earl of Clor 
renddtt, in their Memoirs, unravel all the 
Springs of the Civil Wars^ and draw^ at 
full Length, the Pi^hires of thoTe vhofe 
Ambition ihook the Foundation of their 
refpedive Countries. But neither o£ thefe 
two great Writers, makes it his particuUr 
Care to defcribe, with Accuracy, how 
fuch a Colonel was wounded through the 
Bladder, and fuch a Captain in the Kid- 
neys. Nor do they throw away their 
Time in defcribing elegantly of what ^ 

Wood the Benches of the Houfe of Par- 
liament were made. Why then fhould 
an Epick Poet lie under the neceffity of 
elaborating thofe little DeicripticHis which 
every noble Hiftorian avoids with care ? 

Some impute our want of an Epick 
Poem, to the Shackles of Rhime. They 
fay, that the jingling Return of the 
ikme Sounds, which are chiming on, in 
the fame Scops, Meafures, Paufes, with- 
out any Variety, or any Relief to the 
Ear, muft needs occafion an infuppc^table 
Uniformity throughout all the Work. i 

They urge, that wivery cnmps the no^

( 1^7 ) 

bleft GenittS, ani a Poet, inftead of ufing 
Rhime as an Ornament ferviceable to 
his Senfe, makes his own Thoughts fub- 
forvient to Rhime. 

They add, Rhime is a barbarous Go^^ 
thick Invention, owing to the dull Spright- 
iinpfs of the Monks, and contend that 
nothing good can be built with fo bad a 
MateriaL 

Firft, I muft confefs we are Slaves to 
Rhime in France, and our Slavery is alto- 
gether irretrievable. Nay, all our Tra- 
gedies ought to be rhimed : For our Po- 
etry being fetter'd by too ftrift Rules, 
actoiitting of no Inverfions, nor of Ver- 
fes incroaching upon one another, would 
have nothing but Loftinefs of Stile to 
diftinguifli it from Profe, ^f it were not 
for Rhime. We have no manner of 
pretence to Blank Verfe^ we muft keep 
to Rhime neceflarily; and whofoever 
would attempt to throw off a Burthen 
which Mr. Brileau^ Racine^ and Cornetlle, 
have fo glorioufly fuftained, would be 
thought rather weak than bold, and cer- 
tainly would meet with a very unkind 
Reception. 

As to that pretended Uniformity, and 
Tediouiheis, objeded ajgainft Verfes in 
Rhime» it is not to be found in Authors 
truly good| of whatfoevcr Country. ^J- 
/q is read with Fleafure^ though all his 

yerfes. 



< "8 ) ^ < 

Verfes, nay, almoft ^11 his Syllabi^ 
end in a, r, i, o. And' thofe who fay 
Rhime is an Invention of the Monks of 
the feventh Century, are utterly in .the 
wrong. All the Nations, whofe tan- ♦ 

gua^es are known to us, have Verfes in 
Rhimc, except the Greeks and the Ao- 
wans. 

The Return of the fame Sounds, is a 
kind of natural Mufick^ more obvious 
to the Ear, and more eafily reduced into 
an Art, than the Quantity of Syllables. 
It is true, that Diftindion between long 
and (hort Syllables afforded to the Ro- 
mans and Greeks an harmonious Variety 
of Sounds, which by their Quicknefs or 
Gravity, were wonderfully expreffive of 
the impetuous, or flow Motions of the i 
SouL But we ought not (becaufe we 
want fo great an Advantage) to neg- 
left the only one we are in pofleffion of, 
and in the room of which we have nothing 
to fet up. Shou'd we not manure our dwn 
Soil, becaufe ibme others are more fruit- 
ful? 

After thefe little Hints upon our Lan- 
guage, and our Verfification, I will own, 
that an Epkk Poem is a harder Task in 
France^ than in any other Country what- 
ever ; not purely becaufe we Rhime^ but ^ 
becaufe our Rhimes, as well as the other 
Parts of our Verification^ are ty\i dowi^
