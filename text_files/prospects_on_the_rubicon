AN expreflion in the Britifli Parliamei^t 
reipefling the American war^i alluding 
to Julius Csefar having pafled the Rubicon^ 
has on feveral occafions introduced tha? 
river as the figurative river of war. 

Fortunately for England fhe is yet on the 
peaceable fide of the Rubicon ; but as the 
flames once kindled are not always eafily 
extinguifhed, the hopes of peace are not fo 
clear as before the late myfterious difpute 
began. 

Put while the calm lafts, it may' anfwer 
a very good purpofe to . tAke .a view of the 
profpefts, confiftent with the maxim, that 
Tie that goeth to war fhould firft fit down 
and count the coft. 

The nation has a young Minifter at its 
liead, fond of himfelf, and deficient in ex- 
perience ; and inftances have often fhewn 
that judgment is a different thing to genius, 
and that the affairs of a nation arc but un*

ence is wanting.

done, when we impartially confider the 
means, the force, aKfd the money employed. 

It was then Gre^t Britain and America

till nearly the en^ of the war. The great 
number of troopg^ which the American Co- 
lonies then raifed and paid themfelves, were 
fufficient to turn the fcale,"if all other parts 
had been equall. France had not at that time 
attended to Naval Affairs fo much as (he has 
done fince, and the capture of French failprs 
before any declaration of war was made^ 
which however it may be juftified upon po- 
licy, will always be ranked among the cl^n- 
deftine arts of war, affured a certain, but 
unfair advantage againft her, becaufe it was

Whoever will candidly review the pre- 
fent national charafters of England and 
France, cannot but be ftruck with furprize at 
the change that is taking place. The people 
of Prance are beginning to think for them* 
felves, and the people of England r^figning 
up the privilege of thinking. 

The affairs of Holland have been the 
bubble of the day; and a tax is to be laid 
on (hoes and boots' (fo fay the ne'ws-pa>pers) 
for the fervice of the S^adtholder of Hol- 
land. This will undoubtedly do honour to- 
the nation by verifying the old Englifh pro- 
verb, " Over fhoes, over boots/^ 

But tho* Democrites could fcarcely have 
forbore laughing at the folly, yet as Itrious 
argumeni and found rcafoning -^re preferable

to ridicule, it will be belt to quit the vein 
of unprofitable humour, and give the caufe a 
fair inveftigation. But before we do this, 
it may not be improper to take a general 
review of fundry political matters that will 
naturally lead to a better underftanding of 
the fubjcft. 

What has been the event of all the wars 
of England, but an amazing accumulation 
of debt, and an unparalleled burthen of 
taxes. Sometimes the pretence has been to 
fu|>port one outlandifli caule, and fomctimes 
another. At one time Auftria, at another 
time Pruffia, and foon ; but the confequcncc 
has always been taxes. A few men have 
enriched themfclvcs by jobs and contrails, 
^d the groaning multitude bore the bur- 
then. What has England gained by war 
finee the year 1738, only fifty years ago, to 
reeompence her for two hundred millions 
fterling, incurred as a debt within that time, 
and under the annual intereft of which, be- 
fides what was incurred before, fhe Is now 
groaning ? Nothing at all. 

The glare of fancied glory has often been 

held up, and the (hado\yy reeompence im? 

B ^ ppfed

pofed itfelf upon the fenfes. Wars that 
might have been prevented have been madly 
gone into, and the end has been debt and 
difcontent. A fort of fomcthing which 
man cannot account fdr is mixed in his com-* 
pofition, and renders him the fubjedt of de-. 
ception by the very means he takes not to 
be deceived^ 

That jealoufy which the individuals of 
evifery nation feels at the fuppofed defigns of 
foreign powers, fits them to be the prey of 
Mhiifters, and of thpfe among themfelves 
whofe trade is war, or whofe livelihood i^ 
jqbs and contracts. ^* Confufion to the 
^' politics of Europe, and may every nation 
** be at war in fix months,^^ was a toaft 
given in the hearing of the writer.-f-i 
The man was in court to tjie Miniftry for a 
job* — Ye gentle Gfaces, if any fuqh there 
be, who prefide over human actions, how 
muft ye weep at the vicipufnefs of man.

^a!ture cannot be difmifled, the calamities;

human fpecies/ the thoufands and tens of

dered wretched by .the event, lure ly there U 
Ibmcthlng in the heart of man that calls 
ijpon him to think ! Surely there is feme 
tender cord, tuned by the hand of its Creator, 
that ftill ftruggles to emit in the hearing of 
the foul a note of forrowing lympathy. Let 
it then be heard, and let man learn to feel, 
that the truegreatnefs of a nation is founded 
on principles of humanity ; and that to avoid 
la war when her own exiftcnce is not en- - 
dangered, and wherein the happinefs of 
jnan muft he wantonly facrificed, is a higher 
principle of true honour than madly to en- 
gage in it. 

But independent of all civil and moral 
confiderations, there is no poflible event 
that a war could produce either to England 
jor France, on the prefent occafion, that 
.could in the mofl: diftant proportion recom- 
pence to either, the expenccfhe muft be at. 
War involves in its progrefs fuch a train of 
nnforfeen and unfuppofed circumftances, fuch 
a combination of foreign matters, that no 
human wifdom can calculate the end. It 
has but one thing certain, aud that is increafe 
pf taxes. The policy of European Courts

is now fo caft, and their inte^efl: (b inter-* 
woven with each other, that however eafy 
it may be to begin a war, the weight and 
influence of interfering nations cooi pel even 
the conqueror to unprofitable conditions of 
peace. 

Commerce and maritime flrength arc now 
becoming the faOiion, or rather thi^ rage of 
Europe, and this naturally excites in them 
a combined wifli to prevent either England 
or France en crealing its comparative ftrength 
by dcftroying, or even relatively weakening 
the other, and therefore, whatever views 
each may have at the commencement of a 
w§r, new enemies will arife as either gains 
thjp advantage, and continual obftacles en^ 
fue to embarrafs fqccefs. ^ 

The greatnefs of Lewis the Fourteenth 
jnade ]plurope his enemy, and the fame caufo 
wjll Dfodupe the fame confequence to any 
other European Power.- That nation, 
therefore, only is truly wife, who contenting 
berfelf with fhe ipcans of defence, creates 
to herfelfno uimeceffary enemies by fceking 
to be greater than the fyftem of Europe ad- 
fii]ts. The Mpn;irch or th? Miftift^r who 

cxpceds 



[71 

exceeds this line, knows but little of hia 
bufinefs. It is what the poet ou another 
occafion calls-— 

•^ The point where fcnfc and nonfcnfc join.*' 

Perhaps there is not a greater inftance oi 
the folly of calculating upon events, than 
are to be found in treaties of alliance. • As- 
loon as they have anfwered the immediate 
purpofe of either of the parties, they arc 
but little regarded. Pretences, afterwards^ 
are never wanting to explain them away, 
nor reaibns to render them abortive. -And 
if half the money which nations lavifh on 
fpeculative alliances were referved for their 
own immediate purpofe, whenever the oc- 
cafion Ihall arrive, it would be more pro- 
duftivcly and advantngcoufly employed; 

Monarchs and Minifters, from ambition 
-or refentment, often contemplate to them- 
felves fchemes of future greatnefs, and fet 
out with what appears to them the faireft 
profpeft : In the naean while, the great 
wheel of time and fate revolves unobfcrved, 
and Ibmething, never dreamed of, turns up 
and blafts the whole. A few fancied or un- 
profitable 



[ 8 ] 

profitable laurels fupply the abferlce of fud- 
cefs, and the exhaufted nation is huzzaM into 
new Taxes. 

The politics and interefts of European 
Courts are fo frequently varying with re- 
gard to each other, that there is no fixing 
even the probability of their future conduct. 
But tlie great principle of alliancing feems 
to be but little underftood or little 
cultivated in Courts, perhaps the leaft 
of all in that of England* — No alliance can 
be operative, that does not embrace within 
itfelf, not only the attachment of the Sove- 
reigns, but the real intereft of the nations. 

The alliance between France and Spain^ 
however it may be fpoken of as a mere fa- 
mily compa^S:, derives its greateft flrength 
from national intereft. The mines of Peril 
and Mexico are the Soul of this alliance* 
Were thofe mines extinct, the family com- 
pa<ft would moft probably diflblve^ 

There exifts not a doubt in the mind of 
Spain, what part England would ail, re* 
fpe£ling thofe mines, could (he demolifh the 
maritime power of France ; and therefore 
the intereft of Spain feels itfelf continually 

united 



[ 9 i 

tinited with iPrance. Spain have high ideaS 
of honour, but they h^ave not the fame ideas 
of Englifh honour. They confider Eng- 
land as wholly governed by principles of 
tnteredj and that whatever flie thinks it her 
intereft to do, and fuppofes fhe has the 
power of doing, fhe nrji?ikes very little cere-- 
money of attempting.' But this is not all — ^ 
There is. not a nation in Europe but what 
is more fatisfied that.thofe mines fliould be 
in the poffeflion of Spain^ than in that of 
any other European nation, becaufe the 
wealth of thofe mines, fufficient to riiiii 
Europe in the hands of Ibme of its powers, 
is innocently employed with rcfgefl to Eu- 
rope, and better and more peaceably dirtri- 
buted among them all^ through the me- 
dium of Spain, than it would be through 
that of any other nation^ This is one of 
the fccret caufes that combine fo large a part 
of Europe in the intereft of 'France, becaufe 
they cannot but confider her as ftanding as 
a barrier to fecure to them the free and equ^l 
diftrlbution of this wealth throughout all 
the dominions of Europe. 

C This 



[ 10 1 

IPhls alliance of' intereft is Iikewifc o(t& 
of the unfecn cements tbat prevents Spainr 
and Portugal, two nations not very friendly 
to each other, proceerfin^g to hoftiliti'es. 
They are both in the fame fituation, and 
whatever their diflfikes may be, they can- 
not fail to coniider, that by giving w^ay ta 
refentment that wotrld weaken and exhauft 
themfelves, each would be expofed a prey- 
to fbme ftronger power. 

In (hort^ this alfiance of national intereft: 
is the only on^ ihat can be trufted, and tha 
only one that can be operative. All other al- 
liances formed on the mere will and caprice 
of Sovereigns, or family eonnedlions, un- 
combined with national iuterefts, are but the 
quagmire of politics, and never fail to be- 
come a lofs to that nation who waftes its^ 
prefent fubftanceon the expe^ucy €^f diftant 
returns. 

With regard to Holland a tt^aft mufS 
know very tittle of the matter^ not to know^ 
that there exifts a ftrongcr principle of ri- 
valfliip between Holland and England in 
point of commerce^ than prevails between 
England and France in paint of power :; 

and 



and, therfefore, whenever A Stswltholder of 
Holland fhajl fee it his intereft to vnite witb 
the principle of his country, and aft in con- 
cert with the fentiniiei>ts of the very people 
who pay him for his fervice^, the means 
now taken by England to render him for-^ 
midable, will operate contrary to the pohti- 
cal expedations of (he prefent day, 

Circumftanccs will produce their own na* 
tural effefts,and no other, let the hopes or. 
expeftationsofman be wl^at they may. It 
is not our doing a thing with the defignthat 
it (hall aaf\Ver fuch or fuch an end, that 
will caufe it to produce that end ; the ipear» 
talcen muft have a natural ability and ten-^ 
idcncy within themfelves to produce no other,, 
for it is this, and not our wiflies or policy, 
that governs the event. 

The Englifli Navigation AS: was levelled 
againft the intereft of the Dutch as a wholq 
nation, and therefore it is not to be fuppofed 
that the catching gt the accidental circum^ V 
fiances of one map, as in the cafe of the pre- Y 
iVnt Stadtholder, can combine the intereft 
of that country with this, A few years^

place where all things are forgotten, and his 
fucceffor, contemplating his father's troubles, 
will be naturally led to reprobate the means 
that produced them, and to repofe himfelf 
on the interefts of his country, in preference 
to the accidental and tumultuous afliftancc of 
exterior power. 

England herfelf exhibits at this day,* a 
ipecies of this kind of policy. The prefent 
feign, by embracing the Scotch, has tran* 
quilized and conciliated the fpirit that dif- 
turbed the two former reigns. AcCufetion'^ 
were not wanting at that time to reprobate 
the policy as thiiftured with ingratitude to- 
wards thofe who were the inimediate means 
of the Hanover fuccellion. The brilliant 
pen of Junius was drawn forth, but in vaiii. 
It enraptured without convincing ; and the* 
in the plenitude of its rage it might be faid 
to give elegance to bitterncfs, yet the policy 
furvived the blaft. 

• What then will be the nj^tural confequencc 

of this expence, on account of the Stadthoi- 

. oer, or of a war entered into from that 

caufe ? Search the various windings and ca- 

Y^rns of the human heart, and draw fror^ 



[ '3 ] 

thence the mofl probable conclufion, for 
this is more to be depended upon than th^ 
prdjefts or declarations of Miniftcrs. ' 

It may do very well for a paragraph in'ai 
news-paper, or the wild efFufions of roman- 
tic politicians, or the mercenary views of 
thofe who wifli for war on any occafion, or 
on ho occafion at all, but for the fake of jobs 
und contrads, to talk of French fineffe or 
French intrigue ; but the Dutch are not a 
people to beimpreffed by the fineflb or in- 
trigue of France or England, or any other 
Jiation; If there has been any fineffe in the 
cafe, it has been between the Eledlorate of 
Hanover, the Kingof Pruflia, and the Stadt-r 
holder, in which it is moft probable the peo- 
ple of England will be fineffed out of a funa 
of money. 

The Dutch, as is already obfcrved, aa 
not a people open to the impreffion of fineffe#' 
It is loft upon thepi. They are imprefled 
by their commercial intereft. It is the po- 
litical foul of their country, the fpring of 
iheir aftioQiS, and when this principle coin-» 
frjcjes with4baii: ideas qf freedom, it has all 

the 



C H } 

the unpulfe a Dutchmaa is ctpaUe o( 
Iceling. 

The Oppofitiort in Holland were the 
enetoies of the Staxltholder, upon a convic- 
tion that he was not the friend of their nz^ 
lional interefts. They wanted no impulfd 
Jbut this. Whether this defeft in bim pro-* 
ceeded from foreign attachment, from bri^ 
j^ery or corruption ^ or from the wcU-knowq^ 
i^efedt of bis underftanding, is hot the point 
pf enquiry. It was the effect rather than 
the caufe that irritated the Hollanders. 

If the Stadthpldisr made ufe of the power 
he held in the government to expofe and 
fndanger the intere^s and property of the 
very people; who fMpportpd him, what other 
incentive does any man in any country re^ 
quire. If the Hollander^ conceived the con- 
duit of the Stadtholdcr injurious to their 
Dational intereft, they had the fame right to 
jexpel him which England had to expel tho 
Stuarts ; and the interference of ipngland to 
re-eftabli(h him, feryes oply to confirm ift 
the Hollanders the fame hatred againft Engf 
land which the attempt of Lewis t^e XI Vtb, 
tp fe-eftablifh the Stuarts caufed ip England 

againfj; 



[ 15 7 

againft France ; therefore, if the prefent pO- • 
licy is intended to attach Holland to Eng- 
land, it goes on a principle exceedingly 
cJrroneous. 

' Let us now confider the fituation of thc' 
Stadtholder, as making another part of the 
queftion. 

He muft place the caufe of his troubles to: 
fomc fecret influence which governed his 
conduA during the late war, or in other 
words, that be was fufpefted of being the 
tool of the then Britifh Adminiftration. 
'Therefore, as every part of an argument. 
i:)ught to have its weight, inftead of charg- 
ing the French of intriguing with the Hoi-- 
landers, the charge more confiftently lies 
againft the Briti(h Miniftry, for intriguing 
with the Stadtholder, and endangering the 
nation in a war without a fufEcient object* 
That which the Miniftry are now doing con- 
firms the fufpicion, and explains to the Hol- 
landers that collufion of the Stadtholdej' 
againft their national interefts, which he 
muft wifti to have concealed, and the expla- ■ 
nation dloes him more hurt than the unne-

tcfliary parade of fervice has- dorie hitxj

• Nothing but riecefEty fhould h^ye ope- ' 
rated with England to appear openly .in a 
cafelhat fnuft'put^thc Stadthblder oh -ftill- 
worfe terms with his countryoien. Had 
France made any difpofition for war, hadfho* 
armed, had fhe'niade any one hoftile prepa- 
ration, there might'then have been fdrhepre-^ 
tence for England.taking a ftep, that cannot^ 
fail to expole to the world that the fufpi-* 
cions of the Hollanders againft the Stadt— 
holder wfere well founded, and that their- 
caufe was juft, however unfuccefsful has beene- 
the event. 

As to the confequence of Holland inthe- 
fcale of Europe (the great ftake, fayfome of 
the news-papers, for which England is con- 
tending) that is naturally pointed out by her 
condition : As'merchants for other nations het^ 
intereft didates to her to be a neutral power/ 
and this (he always will be unlpfs Ibe i$ madct 
war upon, as was* the " cafe in^ the Uft war ^ 
and any expeftation beyond what is the lin^ 
of her intereft, that - is,- beyond neutrality^ 
either in England or France, will prove abor- 
tive. 



i 17 j 

tive. It therefore cannot be policy to go to 
iyar to effeft that at a great cxpcnce, which 
will naturally happen of itfelf, and beyond 
which there is nothing to expedt. 

Let Holland be allied with England or 
With France, or with neither, or with bothj 
her national conduit, confeqUently arifing 
out of her circumftances^ will be nearly the 
fame, that iSj ftie will be neutrali Alliances 
have fuch a natural tendency td fink int6 
harmlefs inoperative things, that to make 
them a caufe for going to war, either to 
prevent their being formed, or to break 
any already formed, is the lillieft fpe- 
culatiori that war can be made Upon, or 
Wealth wafted to accomplifti. It would 
fcarCely be worth the attempt, if war could 
be carried on without expence, becaufe 
dlmoft the whole that can be hcfped at the 
rilk and expence of a war^ is efFe£ted by 
their natural tendency to inaflivityi 

However pompous the declarations of ^rt^ 
alliance may be, the object of many of them 
is no other than good-will and reciprocally 
Jecuring, as far as fuch fecurity can go, that 
neither fliallgoin the enemies of the other 
in any war that may happen* But the na- 
D tional 



[ i8. 1 

tional circumftanccs of Holland, operate t* 
enfiikre this tranquility on her part as effec* 
tnally to the power fhe is not allied with, aS' 
the engagement itfelf does to the power with 
whom fhe is allied ; therefore the fecurity 
from clrcumftances* is as good as the fecu* 
rlty from engagement. 

As to a cordrai union of intcrefl betwcca 
Holland and England, it is as unnatural to 
happen as between two individual rivals i» 
the fame trade : And if there is any fVep 
that England could take to put it at a ftill 
g^reater diftancc, it is the part fhe is now 
a£ling. She has increafed the animofity of 
Holland on the fpeculative politics of inte- 
lifting the Stadtholder^ whofe future r-epofe 
depends upon uniting with the Gppofition in^ 
Holland, as the prelent reiga did with the 
Scotch. How foolifli then has been the- 
policy, how licedlefs the expeiice^ of endan- 
gering a war on account of the affairs o£ 
Holland. * . 

A cordiality between England and France 
is lefs improbable than between England and 
Holland. It is not how an Englifhmaa 
feels .but how a Dutchman feels,^ that decides.

rtiis qucftlon. Between England tind France 
there is no real rivallhip of intcreft ; it is 
more the efFeft of temper, difpofition, and 
thejealoufy of confiding in each other, than 
any fubftantial caufe, that keeps up the 
animofity. But on the part of Holland 
towards England, there is over and ahove the 
^rit of animofityj the more powerful ibcv 
tivcs of intcrefted commercial rivalfliip, and 
the galling remembrance of paft injuries* 
The making war upon them under Lord 
North's adminiftration, when they were 
taking no part in the hoftilities, but merely 
ading the bufinefs of merchants, is a cir- 
cumftance that will not cafily be forgotten 
by them. On thefc reafo<is, therefore, 
which are naturally deduced from the ope- 
rative feelings of mankind, -any expeftation* 
of attaching Holland to England as a friendly 
power, is vague and futile. Nature has her 
©wn way of working in the heart, and all 
plans of politics not founded tliereon will 
difappoint themfelves.

out f3rftcm, To ^ftablifli this, it is only 
neeeffary to examine «ne circumftanqe freih 
in the mind of every man- 

The American war was profecuted at a 
very great expence, on the publicly declare4 
opinion, that the retaining America was n€- 
ceffary to thp exiftence pf England ; hut 
America b^ing^ow feparated from England, 
the prcfent politics ?re, that (he is better 
Y without \itx than with her. Both thefe 
y cannot be true, and their pontradidion to 
each other fhews a wantpf fyftepi. If the 

■ latter is true, it amounts tp an impeachment 
pf the political judgment of Qoyernmenti 
becaufe the difcov^ry ought to have been, 
made before the expence wa^ gone into* 
This finglc circumftance, yet frefli in every 

' paan's mind, is fufficient to create a fufpi- 
cion, whether tbe prefent me^fures are more 
wifely founded than the former ones ; an4 

• whether experience may pot prpye, that goingj 
to war for the fake pf the Stadtholder, or for 
the hope of retaining a partial intereft ir\

tral power, is' not as we^ 'policy at going ta 
war to retaiu America. 

If England is powerful enough to main- 
tain her own ground and confequencc in the 
world as m independent nation, (he needg 
no foreign connection. If (he is not, the 
fad contradi£ts the popular opinion that flie 
ii. Therefore, cither her politics are wrong, 
pr her true condition is not what (he fup- 
pofes it to be. Either (he muft give up her 
ppinion to juftify her politics, or renounce 
her poUtics to vindicate her opinion^ 

If fome kind of conuedion with Holland 
is fuppofed to be an objeft worthy fome ex- 
pence to obtain, it may be afked why was 
that connexion broken by making war upon 
her in the iafl war, If it was not then worth 
preferving withoyt expencc, is it now worth 
jre-obtaining at a vaft expence ? If the Hol- 
landers dp not like the Englifli, can they be 
jpcizdc to like them againft their wills ? If il 
ihall be faid that under the former connec- 
tion they were unfriendly, will they be 
jnore friendly under any other ? They were 
(hen in as free a iituation to chufe as any fu- 
ture cifcumAancesi (:an make them, and,

therefor^, the national governing fentimcnt 
of the country can beeafily difcovercd, for it 
fignifies not what or who a Stadtholder may 
bcf that which governs Holland is, and al- 
ways muft be, a commercial principle, and it 
will follow this line in fpite of politics. In- 
tereft is as predominant and as filcnt in its ope- 
rations as love ; it refifts all the attempts of 
force, and countermines all the ftratagem 
ofcontrouh 

The ^ moft able , Englifli Statefmen and 
Politicians have always held it as a principle, 
that foreign connexions ferved only to em- 
barrafs and exhauft England. That, furround- 
ed by the ocean, (he could not be invaded as 
countries are on the Continent of Europe, 
and that her infular fituation didated to her 
^ different fyftem of politics to what thofc 
countries required, and that to be cnleagued 
with them was facrificing the advantages of 
fituation to a capricious fyftem of politics, 
^■^ Thattho^ fhe might ferve them, they could 
not much ferve her, and that as the fervice 
muft at all times be paid for, it could always 
be procured when it was wanted ; and that 
ll would be better to take it up in this line 



[ 23 1 --•'— 

than to cmbarrafs herfcif with fpeculativc 
alliances that ferved rather to draw her into 
a Continental war on their account, than 
extricate htfr from a war undertaken an her 
own account. 

From this difcuflion of the affairs of Hol^* 
land, and of the inadequacy of Holland as 
an objeft for war, we will proceed to (hew 
that neither England nor France arc in a 
condition to go to war, and that there is no 
prefent objed to the one or the other to 
recqmpence the expence that each muft be 
at, or atone to the fubjefts of either for the 
additional burthens that muft be brought 
upon them. I defend the caufe of the poor, 
of the manufafturer, of the tradefman, of 
the farmer, and of all thofe on whonii 
the real burthen of taxes fall — but above all, 
I defend the caufe of humanity. 

It will always happen, that any rumour 
of war will be popular among a great num- 
ber of people in London. There arc thou- 
fands who live by it ; it is their harveft ; 
and the clamour which thofe people keep 
up in news- papers and converfations, pafles 
vinfufpicioufly for the voice of the people, 

and- 



6t)(3'it IS rtot ttll after the mifchicf is dontf/ 
that the deception is difcovercdi 

Such' people are continually holding up 
in very magnified terms the weahh of the 
nation, and the depreffed condition of - 
Prance, as reafons for cbmmendng a war, 
without knowing any thing of either of thefel 
fubjefts. 

But admitting them to be ds tfue^as they' 
are falfcj as will be het-eafter (hewn, it cer-^ 
tRinly indicates a vilcnefsj m the national 
difpofition of any country, that will make 
the accidental internal difficulties to which 
ajl nations are fubjedt, zhd fdmetimes en- 
cumbered with, a reafon for makhig war 
tippn theni. The amazing encreafe and 
magnitude of the paper currency, now float- 
ing in all piirts of England, expofes her to 
a (hock as much more tremendous than the 
Ihock occaiioned by the bankruptcy of the 
South Sea funds, as the quantity of credit 
and paper currency is now greater than they 
were at that time.:. Whenever fuch a cir- 
oumftance (hall happen, and the wifeft men 
hi the nation are, and cannot avoid .beings 
imprefiid with the danger, it would be 
looked upon a bafenefs in France to make

The little which nations know', or arcf 
fome times .willing to know, of each other^; 
feryes to precipitate them into wars whicK 
neither would have undertaken, had fhe 
fully ifnoWn the extent of the power and 
circumftances of the other ; it may there- 
fore be of fome. ufe to place the cirqurri- 
ftances of England and. France in a compa- 
rative point of view. 

In Order to do this the accidental circum- 
ftances of a nation muft be thrown out of 
the account. By accidental circumftances is 
meant, thofe temporary disjoin tings aiid de- 
rangements of its internal fyftcm which 
every nation in the world is fubjedt to, and 
which, like accidental fits of (icknefs in the 
human body, prevents in the interim the full 
exertion and exereife of 'its natural powers. 
•^ The fubftantial bafis of the power of a 
^nation arifes out of its popuhvtion, its wealth* 
and its revenues. To thefe may be addtd 
the difpofitioh of the people. Each of thefe' 
Will be fpokcn to as we pr©cecd# 
^ *' ' "^ Inftances 



C -?7 ] 

Inftances are not wanting to (hew that 
a 'nation confiding too much, on its natural 
ftrength^ is hfs inclined to be aftive iix its 
operations than one of lefs natural powers 
,who is obliged to fupply thqj: deficiency by 
encreafing its exertions. This has oftea 
been the cafe between England and France. 
The adlivity of England krifing frqm it's 
fears, , has fbcnetimes exceeded the exertions 
ef France repofing on its confidence. 

But gs this depends on the. accidental ^if- 
pbfition of a people, it will not alWays. be 
the fame. It is a matter well known to 
every man wh© has lately been In Francd, 
that a very extraordinary change is working 
itfelf in the ipin(Js pf the people ef that na- 
tion. A fpirit' that will rqiider France ex:- 
ccedihgly formidably whenever its govern- 
ment Ihall embrace the- fortunate opportu* 
nity of doubling its ftrength by allying, if 
it may be fo expreffed, (for.it is difficult to 
exprefs a new idea by old terms) the Ma- • 
jefty of the Sovereign with the Majefty of 
the nation ; for of all alliances this iS infi- 
nitely the ftrbngeft and the fafeft 'to bfQ 
tfyfted to, becaufe' the intereft fo formed, 



[ 2« 3 

f^nd operating againft external eneniies caft 
pcver be divi4ed. 

It may be taken ^s a certain rule, that 9 
fubjcfl: of ajiy pountr^ attached to the go^ 
ycrnment on the principles above-mentioned 
is of twice the valup he was before. Freen 
dom in the fubjeft is not a diminution, a,? 
was formerly believed, of the power of gor 
vrrnmcnt, but an iucreafe of it. Yet the 
progrcfs by which changes of this kind aro 
f fFefted, requires to \xe nicely attended to. 

Were governments to offer freedom to the 
people, or to fhew a,n anxiety for that puy- 
pofe, the offer moft probably would be re-» 
jelled. The purpof? for which it was of- 
fered, might be m.^ftrufte^. Therefore the 
defire mijft originate with, and proceed froni 
the mafs of the pcQple, and when the ipin 
preffion becomes unirerfal, and not beforcj^ 
is the important moment for ^he m©fl: ef? 
feftual confoUd^tipn of national ftren^h and 
greatncfs that can take place. 

While this change is working, there wiH, 
fippcar a kind of chaos on the nation ; but^ 
^hc creation we enjoy arofe out of ^, champs, 

an4 



tnd CHir greatefl bleffings appear to have t 
confufed beginning. 

Therefore, we may take it for granted, 
that what has at this moment the appear^ 
ance of diforder in France, is no more thaa 
one of the natural links in that great chain 
of circumftances by which nations acquire 
the fummit of their grcatnefs. The Pro- 
vincial Aflemblies already began in France^ 
are as full, or rather a fuller reprefentatioa 
of the people than the Parliaments of Eng-» 
land are. 

The French, or, as they were formerly 
called, the Franks, (from 'whence came 
the Englifli word Frank and Fjpee) were once 
the freed people in Europe ; and as nations 
appear to have their periodical revolutions, 
it is very probable they will be fo again« 
The charge, is already began. The people 
of France, as is before obferved, are begin- 
Jng to think for themfelves, and the people 
of England rcfigning up the prerogative of 
thinking; 

We fliall now proceed to compare the pre- 
sent condition of England and France as to 
population revenues ^nd wealth, and to fhew 

that

This is an important inveftigation, it ought 
therefore to be heard with patience, and 
judged of without prejudice. 

Nothing is more common than for people, 
to miftake one thing for another. Do not 
thofe who are crying up the wealth o( 
the nation, miftake a paper currency fot 
riches? Toafcertain this point maybepne 
of the means of preventing that ruin which 
cannot fail to follow by perfifting in the 
miftake. 

.: The higheft eftimation that is made of 
the quantity of gold andiilver.iu Briti.irt 
at this prefeut day is twenty millions : and 
thofe who are moft converfant with money 
tranfadtions, believe it to be coufidefably 
below that fum. Yet this is no more 
money than what the nation pofleflecJ 
twenty years ago, and therefore, whatever 
her trade may be, it has produced to her no 
|)rofit. . Certainly no man can be fo unwif«r 

as 



I 33 ] 

as to fuppofe that cncrcafing the quantity of 
bank notes, which is done with as littW 
trouble as printing of news -papers, is na* 
national wealth. 

The quantity of money in the nation was 
very well afcertained in the years I773f 
74, and 76, by calling in the light gold 
coin. 

There were upWards of fifteen millions* 
and a half of gold coin then called in, which^ 
with upwards of two millions of heavy gui** 
neas that remained out, and the filver coin, 
made above twenty millions, which is more .. r 
than there is at this day. . There is aa 
amazing increafe iii the circulation of Bank 
paper, which is no more national wealth 
than news-papers are ; becaufe an increafe of 
promiflary notes, the capital remaining'unin- 
creafed, or not incrcafirig in the fame propor- 
tion, is no increafe of wealth. It ferves to 
jaife falfe ideas which the judicious fbon 
difcoverj and the ignorant experience to their 
cofti 

Out of twenty millions fterling^ the pre* 

ifent quantity of real money in the nation^ 

it would be too great an allowance to fay 

' F thiit

that one fourth of that fiim, which is iitff 
millions, was in London. But even admitting; 
this to be the cafe, it would recjuire no very 
Gonjuring powers to afcertain pretty nearly . 
tvrhat proportion' of that fom of five millions 
cbald be in the Bank^ It would be ridi* 
cnloJus'-to fuppofe it could be lefs than hal^ 
a million, and extravagant to fappofe ir 
tould be two mrlKonS.

difcemm«nt to afcertain how immex^fe the 
qiianthy of Bank NotcSy compared to its ca^

fidered, that th^ national taxes are paid irt

name. There* it wa$ called Contmeiitat: 
Money, and here it is called Bank Notes* 
But it fignifies not what name it bears, if 
the capital is not equal to the redemption. : 
There is like wife another circumftancc 
that cannot fail to ftrikc* with feme force 
when it is mentioned, ,bec^p(e every mati 
that has any thing to do ^y^th money tranf-'; 
adions, will feel the truth of it, tho^'he may , 
not before have reflected upon it. Iris the 
embarfaffcd condition mto which the gold* 
coin is thrown by the necfeflity of weighing 
it> and by refuiing guineas that' are eyen 
flanding weight, -and there appears to be but 
few heavy ones. Whether this is intended 
to force the Paper Currency into circulation^ 
is not here attempted to be aflerted, but it., 
certainly has that efFeft to a very great de- 
gree^ becaufe people, rather than fubmit to 
the trouble and hazard of weighing, will take . 
paper in preference to money. This was once 
the cafe in America. 

The natural efFeft of encreafing and con* 

tinuing to increafe paper currencies is that 

of banifliing the real money. Thc/fhadow 

Fa takes 



[ 36 ] 

takes place of the fubftance till the country is 
left with only Ihadows in its hands. 

A trade that does not increafe the quan- 
tity of real money in a country, cannot bo 
ftiled a profitable trade ; yet this is certainly 
the cafe with England t and as to credit, of 
which fo much has been faid, it may be 
founded on ignorance or a falfc belief, as well 
as on real ability* 

In Amfterdam, the money depofited in 
the Bank is never taken out again. The de-! 
pofitors, when they have debts to pay, tranf^ 
fer their right to the perfons to whom they 
are indebted, and thofe again proceed by the 
fame praftice, and the transfer of the fight 
goes for payment ; now could all the money 
dopofited in the Bank of Amfterdam bepri-- 
yately removed away, and the matter be kept 
a fecret, the ignorance, or the belief that the 
money was ftill there, would give the fame 
credit as if it had not been removed. In 
ihort, credit is often no more than an opi- 
nion, and the difference between credit and 
money is that money requires no opinion to 
|upport it,

twenty years *• This has fpread itfelf over

are tiie firft to fuffeis thejr are often thelaffi 
to forcfee an evil. * 

Let us now caft a lobfc ttowards the ifta- 
flufaflures. A great deal has been faid o^ 
their flofurifliing condition, and perh&ps i 
great deal too much, for it' may agtin b* 
aflccd, where is the pro£t if there is no cii- 
crcafe of money in the nation* 

The woollen manufafture is the ftapl© 
manufafture of England, and this is ev- 
dently on the decline, in feme, if not in alf, 
its branches. The city of Norwich^ one 
of the moftrpdpulous cities in England, and 
wholly dependant on the woollen manufac- 
ture, is, at this day in a very impovcrifhed 
condition, owing to the decline of its trade. 

But not to reft the matter on a general 
aflertion, or cmbarrafs it with numerous 
ftatements, we will produce a circumftailcd 
by which the whole progrefs of the trade 
may be afcertamed. 

So long a:3 thirty years aga the price paid 
to the fpimier^ of wool was one (hilling for 
twenty-four fkains, each (kain containing five 
hundred and fixty yards* This, according 
to the term of the trade, was called giving a 

ihiHIiig 



C 40 3 

(hilUdg fbr a (hilling. A good hand would fpiti 
twelve ikains, which was fixpence a day. 
. According to the increafe of taxes, and 
the increafed price of all the articles of life, 
they certainly ought now to get at leaft fif-* 
teen pence, for -what thirty years ago they 
got a (hilling for. But fuch is the decline 
of the trade,, that the cafe is directly the 
contrary. They now get butninepence for rhe'^ 
ihilling, that is, they get but nine pence for 
what thirty years ago they got a (hilling for* 
Can thefe people cry out for war, when they 
are already half ryincd by the decline of 
trade, and half devoured by the encreafe of 
taxes. 

But this is not the wholeof the misfortunes 
which that part of the country fuffers, and 
which will extend to others. The Norfolk 
farmers were the firft who went into the 
praftlce of manuring their land with marie : 
But time has (hewn, that though it gave a 
vigour to the land for fome years^ it operated 
in the end to exh^uft its ftamina ; that the' 
lands in many parts are worfe than before 
they began to marie, and that it will ixOt an^ 
Iwer to marie a fecond time.

. It is very well known that papei^ has ttor 

the credit in France which it has in Eng-*

lefs of it. This has naturally operated to en- 
creafe the (Quantity of gold and filver ia 
France, and prevent the encreafe of paper. 

The higheft eftimaftion of the quantity of

is twenty millions fterling, and the quantity'

' The quantity of gold and filver in France^i

France, therefore, has a long run of credit ^

^Thc arfnual intereft of tlie national debt 
of England and France arc nearfy equal, be-* 
ing Nine Millions fterling'; bur witfi' 
this difference, that above thtee millions.' 
and a half of the annual infereft of France are 
only life annuities. The intertft, therefore, of ^ 
her debt leflens every year,' and (he will have 
a furplus up to the amount of three millions 
and a half, to apply to the purchafe of that 
part of the debt which is on perpetual in*^ 
tcreft ; therefore, without any new taxes for 
jhat purpofe, {he can difcharge her whole- 
debt in lefs than a third of the time on whicH ' 
it can be done in England, .according to Mr, 
Pitt*s plan, with his additional tax of. a^ 
million a year. .** * 

But let the event of Mr. Pitt's plan b? 
what it may, as to reducing the ^dbt, 
there is one circumftance that cannot fail to 
accompany it, which is» that of making i%_ 
the intereft of Governitient, in execut-. 
ing this plan, to undermine the intereft 
of its creditors, or the value of the funds, fpr 
the piirpofe of pVirchaiing at axheaper rate. 
The plan is founded on^the prefumption 
of a lo^ig uninterrupted peace,^ and that fu-* 



,ture loans would not be wanted, which can 

not now he expefted, for France in her turn 

is getting into a temper for war. The pl^n 

. naturally ftrikes at the credit of Govern- 

• tnent, in contrading further debts, for were a 

. loan to be opened to-morrow, the fubfcribers, 

naturally perceiving that it was the intereft 

of Government to undermine them as foon 

as they became creditors, would confequent* 

. ly feek to fecure themfelves, by demand- 

. ing higher prcihiums at firft. It is a 

queftion, whether a premium of thirty per 

. cent, is now as good as ten was before, and 

therefore the plan, in cafe of a war, inftead ot 

leflening the debt, fervcs to pufli it more ra* 

,pidly on. 

The Minifter certainly never undcrftood 
the natural operation of his plan, or he 
would not have a£ted as he has done. The 
plan has two edges, while he has fuppofed It 
to have only one. It ftrikes at the debt in 
peace, and at the credit in war. 

The gentleman who originally furniflied 

the Minifter with this plan, now gives it 

. totally up. He knew its operation both, in 

peace and war, but the Minifter apr ears not to

When a Bank makes tetf free with itt 
paper, it expofes itfelf in much the famt 

* manner which a Government. doe» that 
makes too free with its power ; too much 
credit is as bad as too little ; . and there i^ ^ch

e^poies a Bank more than being tmder the

to accompany the difputes of nations, fcarce- 
ly any thing is to be. feen but mean abufe 
and low fcurrility. This is not the cafe in 
^^l^ any other country in the worl(l bqt Eng- 
land, 

We will now proceed to conclude with a 
few additional obfervations on the ftate of 
politics. 

For leyeral weeks the nation was amufe^ 
with the daily rumours of fome great Ca^* 
binet fecret, and admiring how profoundly 
the fecrct was kept, when the only fecret 
was, that there was no fecret to divulge. 

But this opinion of a fecret very well 
fhews that thp opinion of the nation was 
different to the opinion of theMinifter,or the 
fuppofitionof fome great fecret would not have 
taken place, as the affairs of the Stadtholder 
were thep publicly known. It fliews that 
the nation did not think the Stadtholder 
of tjolland a fufficient reafon for laying new 
faxes on England, and running into the rifk 

an4 



^ 



and cxpence of a war, and great was tho 
furprifc when the declaration, and counter 
.declaration like twin naice peeped frpm the 
Cabinet. 

But there is one fecret that requires to be 
inveftigated, which is, whether th© Mipiftcf 
did not know that France would not engage 
in a war, and whether the preparations were 
not an idle parade, founded on that know* 
Jedge. 

Whether it was not meanly putting Eng-» 
land under the banners pf Pruffia, and tak- 
ing thereby a diflionourable advantage of the y^ ^ 
internal perplexity which France was then 
in, and which in its turn may happen to 
England, to affume the air of a challenge, 
which it muft be known would not be ac- 
cepted, becaufe there was nothing to make 
jhe acceptance neceflary. 

Whether this condudl in the Minifter does 
not mifchieyoufly operate to deftroy the har- 
mony that appeared to be growing up be- 
tween the two nations ; to leflcn, if not to- 
tally deftroy, the advantages of the Com- 
flStrcial Treaty^ ^^^f? t? l^y the feeds of fu- 
ture 



[ 6z ] 

ture XTars, when there was a profpefl: of » 
long and uninterrupted peace. 

When there are two ways ot accomplifli-' 
jng the fame objcdl:, it almoft alwayi happens 
that the one is better than the other, and 
whether the Minifter has not chofcn the 
wor{^. A few obfervations will elucidate this 
point. 

It fignifies not what airy fchcmeSt projeftst 
or even treaties may be formed, cfpeciaily if 
done under the point of the bayonet, for aU 
that can be expedcd from Holland is rieutra^ 
lity. Her trade is with all nations, and it is 
frc>m her neutrality that this trade has arifent 
Deftroy this neutrality and Holland is de- 
ft royed. Therefore it matters not what 
party fentiments men may be of in Hbllandi 
as* to the fitadtholderihip, becaufe there is 
ftill a fuperior banner und?r ^vbich all will 
unite, 

•Holland will not expofe her trade to the 
dcvaftations pf England by joining France in 
^ war, neither will ihc expofe it to France 
by joinijig England,^ It may very well be 
alked, what are England or France to Hol- 
]ia)d„ that ibe (hould Join with eithef in a 

warji 



|!7ar^ unlefs (he ^ compelled to it by ene or 
the other mal^ng war upon her^ as was ti^ 
cafe in the 1^ war. 

Eventymay foon happen m Europe to 
make all the force that Pruffia can raife nc- 
ceflary^to her own defence, and Holland muft 
be vi^fe enough to fee, that by joining Eng- 
land fhe not only expoles her trade to 
^France but likewife her donninions, bqcaufe 
France can invade her in a quarter in which 
^ England cannot defend her, for Holland lies 
* Qpen to France by land. It is, therefore, 
^ more immediately the intereft of Holland to 
ieep on good terms with France, neither 
can England give her any equivalent to ba- 
Jance this circumftancc. How foolifli then 
arc the politics which are dire£led to tinna^ 
tural and impoffible obje<3:s* ' Surely the ex- 
perience of a century paft is fufficient to fliew 
to any man, except oi>e of yefterday^ whaC 
the conduct of Holland in all cafes muft be* 

But there is another circumftarice that do 

not fail to imprefs forelgnjers, and efpecially 

Holland, which is, that the immenfityof the 

national debt of F /»giand, the profpedt of its^ 

, ftill encreafing, and the exorbitancy of her 

papjeir

paper currenclfes, render her too inieciife iH 
hcrfel^tobemuch ccnftSiedih by foreign na- 
tions for any length of ti^e. Becaufethat 
which muft happen may fbhn happen. 

Concerning the refcript c^lvered by th6 
French Minifter, there is one c\rtain expla- 
nation to be put upon it, whicK is, that if 
France had been difpolcd for war, fte would 
not have made that communication^ The 
very making it goes to a full explanation of 
the parts ; and as foon as Mr^ Pitt obtained 
this knowledge, it appeared to him a fafer 
moment to gird on his fword, and whea h> 
found that France was as well weaponed ai 
himfelf topropofe to take it ofFagalti. This^ 
is in a few words the whole hiftory of thd 
campaign. A war Minifter in peace, and a 
peace Minifter in war. Brave where there 
is no danger, and prudent wheh there is. 

The refcript could be nothing elfe than 
Jan explanation, on the part of France^ of the 
lituation fhe confcelved herfelf to be fubjedt 
toj and the probable confequcnces that might 
follow from it* This Ihe was not obliged 
to make^ and therefore her making it was ^ 
unatter of civil conimuniciation towards al

.power fhc was at peace with, and which in 
return entitled her to a fimilar conimunica-- 
tion on the part of the Britifli Cabinet. All 
this might have been done without cither the 
cxpence, the tumult, the provocations, or th« 
ill-blood that has been created. 

The alliance between France and the 
Putch, was formed while the Stadtholder 
was a part of the Government, therefore 
France could not from that alliance take a part 
either for or agaiuft him. She could only 
ad when the whole intereft of the Repub- 
lic was expofed to a foreign enemy, and it 
yfzs not certain that this might not be the 

The refcript, therefore, inftead of being 
taken as a ground for war, was in itfelf a 
ground for peace, becaufc it tended to bring 
on a difcuffion of all the circumftances of 
France and England relative to Holland, 
which could not have failed to place Hol^ 
land in a ftate of neutrality, and that only 
will be the final event now j becaufc, inde- 
pendent of all parties, no other is confident 
with the whole nationalintereft g/ that Re* 
public^

But this not being done, it is now feft fO 
the Dutch to do it for themfelves^ 

An alliance with England, at the fame 
time there is one ei'lVing with France, wifl 
fecure this neutrality fo neceffary to the 
Dutch republic. By this flroke of Politics 
fhewillbe free from all obligations to joirt 
with either in a war, and be j. uaranteed by 
both. Her alliance with England will de- 
bar England from molefting her^ trade 
by fea, and that with France will debar 
France from the fame things and like- 
wife from invading her by land rn all future 
cafes. There are fo many probable ci re um* 
ftances to arife.on the Continent of Eui-optf, 
that the fituation of Holland requires this 
fafeguard, more efpecially from France, on 
account of her land conneftiou. 

The riling greatnefs of the Ruffian Em- 
pire, the probable union of the intereft of this 
Empu*e with that of Germany and France, 
and confequcntly with Spain, whofe intereftj 
cannot be feparated, and the probability of a 
rupture between the Emperor and the King 
of Pruffia, are matters that cannot fail to irn- 
prefs the Datch with the iiecefiity of fc- 
curing th?mfclves by land as well as b} fea,. 
« and 



[ «7 ] 

and to pf^lreftt-^eir being cfrawri infd thd 
quarrels either orEngland of Ffaritfe^ 

Upon the whole, a§ there Ivas a civil ds 
tvell as an uncivil line of politics to be pur- ^ 
fued, every man of humane and generous fen- 
timents muft lament it was not chofen* 

A difpofition for peace was growing up i^ 
every part of France, and there appeared at 
the fame time a mutual one rifmgin England. 
A lilent wifli on both fides, was univerfalfy 
expanding itfelf, that wars, fo fatal to the' 
true intereft, and burthenfome by taxes to 
the fubjefts of both countries might exift 
no more, and that a long ancl lading peace 
might take place* 

But inftead of cultivating this happy op- 
portunity, the pettifti vanity of a young and 
unexperienced Miuifter, who balanced him- 
idf between peace and war to take his choice of 
pircumftances, inftead of pripfijples, and who 
went into an expenfive armamer.t when there 
was nonetocontend with, and not till after the 
affairs of Hoi and might be faid to be termi- 
nated, has deftroyed rhpfe feeds of harmony 
that might have been rendered of more value 
tu both nations than their fleets an<i armies.
