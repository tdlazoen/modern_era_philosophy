A Serious 

PROPOSAL 

TO THE 

LADIES. 



LADIES, 

Since the Profitable Adventures 
that have gone abroad in the 
World have met with fb great En- 
couragement, tho' the higheft ad- 
vantage they can propofe, is an un- 
certain Lot for fuch matters as O- 
pinion, not real worth , gives a va- 
lue to : things which if obtain'dare 
as flitting and fickle as that Chance 
which is to difpofe of them ; I 
therefore perfiiade my felf, you will 
not be lefs kind to a Fropofition 
that comes attended with more cer-

tain and fubftantial Gain; whofe 
only defign is to improve your 
Charms and heighten your Value, 
by fuffering you no longer to be 
qheap and contemptible. Its aim is 
to fix that Beauty, to make it tail- 
ing and permanent, which Nature 
with all the helps of Art cannot fe- 
cure, and to place it out of the reach 
of SFcknefs and Old Age , by tranf 
ferring it from a corruptible Body 
to an immortal Mind. An obliging 
Defign, which wou'd procure them 
inward Beauty , to whom Nature 
has unkindly denied the outward find 
not permit thofe Ladies who have 
comely Bodies,to tarnifh their Glory 
with cleformed Souls. Wou'd have 
you all be wits , or what is better, 
Wife. Raife you above the Vulgar 
by fbmething more truly illuftrious, 
than a (bunding Title or a great 
Eftate. Wou'd excite in you a ge- 
nerous Emulation to excel in the 
beft things, and not in fuch Trifles 
" f 2 very mean perfbn who has but 

Money 



to the Ladies. 5 

Money enough may purchafe as 
well as you. Not fufter you to take 
up with the low thought of diftin- 
guifhing your felves by any thing 
that is not truly valuable, and pro- 
cure you fuch Ornaments as all tie 
Treafures of the Indies are not able 
to purchafe. WouM help you to 
furpafs the Men as much in Vertue 
and Ingenuity,as you do in Beauty ; 
that you may not only be as love- 
ly , but as wife as Angels. Exalt 
arid Eftablifh your Fame , more 
than the beft wrought Poems and 
loudeft- Panegyricks , by ennobling 
your Minds with fuch Graces as 
really deferve it. And inftead of 
the Fufiian Complements and Ful- 
fbme Flatteries of your Admirers, 
obtain for you the Plaudit of Good 
Men and Angels, and the approba- 
tion of Him who cannot err. In 
a word, render you the Glory and 
Bleffingoftheprefent Age, and the 
Admiration and Pattern of the 
next.

And fure , I fhall not need many 
words to perfuade you to dole 
with this Fropcfa/. The very offer 
is a fuiticient inducement, noi; does 
it need the fet-off's of Rhetorick to 
recommend it, were I capable, 
which yet I am not, of applying 
them with the greateft force. Since 
you can't be fb unkind to your 
ielves,as torefufe your real Intereft, 
I only entreat you t6 be fo wife as 
to examine wherein it confifts ; f<pr 
nothing is of worfe confequence 
than to be deceiv'd in a matter of 
fb great concern. 'Tis as little 
beneath your Grandeur as your Pru- 
dence, to examine curioufly what 
is in this cafe offer'd you, and to 
take care that cheating Huckfters 
don't impofe upon you with deceit- 
ful Ware. This is a Matter infi- 
nitely more worthy your Debates, 
than what Colours are moft agree- 
able, or what's the Drefs becomes 
you beft. Your Glafs will not do 
you half fo much fervice as a ferious

refle&ion on your own Minds, 
which will difcover Irregularities 
more worthy your Correfition, and 
keep you from being either too 
much elated or deprefs'd by the re- 
prefentations of the other. 'Twill 
not be near fo advantageous to con- 
fult with your Dancing-Mafter as 
with your own Thoughts , how 
you may with greateft exaftnefs 
tread in the Paths of Vertue, which 
has certainly the moil: attra&ive 
Air, and Wifdom the moft grace-

be always well composM, andev'ry 
thing you do will carry its Charm

nation of your felves is difcommen- 
ded 3 provided you employ your care 
about that which is really your fe/f; 
and do not negle£t that particle of 
Divinity within you, which muft

with your Neighbours as much as

are you fb prepofteroufly humble, 
as not to contend for one of the 
higheft Manfions in the Court of 
Heav'n ? Believe me, Ladies, this 
is the only Place worth contending 
for; you are neither better nor 
worfe in your f elves for going be- 
fore, or coming after now ; but you 
are really fo much the better , by 
how much the higher your ftation 
is in an Orb of Glory. How can 
you be content to be in the World 
like Tulips in a Garden, to make a 
Rnefljew and be good for nothing ; 
have all your Glories ikt in the 
Grave , or perhaps much (boner ! 
What your own fentiments are I 
know not, but I can't without pity 
and rofentment refleft , that thole 
Glorious Temples on which your 
kind Creator has beftow'd fuch ex-

that whilft your Beauty cafts a 
luftre all around you , your Souls 
which are infinitely more bright 
and radiant, (of which if you had 
but a clear Idea , as lovely as it is, 
and as much as you now value it, 
you wou'd thendefpife and negleft

Beauty of the mind is neceflary to 
fecure thofe Ccnquefts which your 
Eyes have gain'd, and Time that 
mortal Enemy to handfbme Faces, 
has no influence on a lovely Soul, 
but to better and improve it. For 
fhame let's abandon that O/d, and 
therefore one wou'd think , un-

road of Vanity and Folly , which 
fb many have gone before us, but 
daie to break the enchanted Circle 

that 



to the Ladies. M 

that cuftom has plac'd us in, and 
fcorn the vulgar way of imitating 
all the ImpertiRenctes of ourNeigh- 
bours. Let us learn to pride our 
felves in fomething more excellent 
than the invention of a Fafhion i 
And not entertain fuch a degrading 
thought of our own worth, as to 
imagine that our Souls were given 
us only for the fervice of our Bodies, 
and that the beft improvement we 
can make of thefe, is to attraft the 
Eyes of Men. We value them too 
much, and our felves too little, if 
we place any part of our defert in 
their Opinion ; and don't think our 
felves capable -of Nobler Tilings 
than the pitiful Gonqueft of fbme 
worthlefs heart. She who has op- 
portunities of making an intereft 
in Heaven , of obtaining the love 
and admiration of GOD and An- 
gels, is too prodigal of her Time, 
and injurious to her Charms , to 
throw them away on vain infig- 
nificant men. She need not make 

her 



17 A Serious Propofal 
her felffb cheap, as todefcend to 
court their Applaufes ; for at the 
greater diftance fbe keeps , and 
the more fhe is above them, the 
more effectually fhe fecures their e- 
fteem and wonder. Be fb generous 
then, Ladies, as to do nothing un- 
worthy of you ; fo true to your 
Intereft, as not to leffen your Em- 
pire and depreciate your Charms. 
Let not your Thoughts be wholly 
bufied in obferving what refpeft is 
paid you, but a part of them at 
leaf!:, in ftudy ing to defer ve it. And 
after all, remember that Goodnefs 
is the trueft Greatnefs ; to be wife 
for your felves the greateft Wit; 
and that Beauty the rnoft defirabk 
which will endure to Eternity. 

Pardon me the feeming rudenefs 
of this Propofal, which goes upon a 
fuppofition that there's fbmething 
amifsinyou, which it is intended 
to amend. My defign is not to ex- 
pofe, but to rettifie your Failures, 
lo be exempt from miftake, is a 

privilege 



to the Ladies. 13 

privilege few can pretend to, the 
greateft is to be paft Convi&ion and 
too obftinate to reform. Even the 
Men y as exaft as they wou'd feem, 
and as much as they divert them- 
felves with our Mifcarriages , are 
very often guilty of greater faults, 
and fuch, as confidering the advan- 
tages they enjoy, are much more 
inexcufable. But I will not pre-; 
tend to correft their Errors , who 
either are, or at leaft think them- 
felves too wife to receive Inftru- 
ftion from a Womans Pen. My 
earned defireis, That you Ladies, 
would be as perfect and happy as 
'tis poffible to be in this imperfed 
ftate ; for I love you too well to 
endure a fpot upon your Beauties, 
if I can by any means remove and 
wipe it ofF.I would have you live up 
to the dignity of your Nature,and 
exprefs your thankfulnefs to G O D 
for the benefits you enjoy by a due 
improvement of them : As I know 
very many of you do, who coun- 
tenance 



1 4. A Serious Propofal 

tenance that Piety which the men 
decry, and are the farighteft Pat- 
terns of Religion that the Age af- 
fords ; 'tis my grief that all the reft 
of our Sex do not imitate fiich Illu- 
ftrious Examples , and therefore I 
would have them encreas'd and ren- 
dered more confpicuous , that Vice 
being put out of countenance, (be- 
caufe Vertue is the only thing in 
fafhion) may fheak out of the 
World,and its darknefsbedifpell'd 
by the confluence of fo many fhin- 
ing Graces, The Men perhaps 
will cry out that I teach you falfe 
Doftrine , for becaufe by their 
feduftions fbme amongft us are be- 
come very mean and contemptible, 
they would fain perfuade the reft to 
be as defpicable and forlorn as they. 
We're indeed oblig'd to them for 
their management, in endeavouring 
to make us lb , who ufe all the ar- 
tifice they can to fpoil, and deny 
us the means of improvement. So 
that inftead of inquiring why all 

Women 



to the Ladies. I 5 

Women are not wife and good, we 
have reafon to wonder that there are 
any fb. Were the Men as much ne- 
giefted , and as little care taken 
to cultivate and improve them, per- 
haps they wou'd be fb far from fur- 
pafling thofe whom they now difc 
pife, that they themfelves wou'd 
fink into the greateft ftupidhy 
and brutality. The prepofterous 
returns that the moft of them make, 
to all the care and pains that is be- 
ftow'd on them, renders this no un- 
charitable, nor improbable Conje- 
£hire. One wou'd therefore almoft 
think, that the wife difpofer of all 
things,forefeeing how unjuftly Wo- 
men are denied opportunities of im- 
provement from 'without has there- 
fore by way of compenfation en- 
dowed them with greater propenfi- 
ons to Vertue and a natural good- 
nefs of Temper within , which 
if duly managed , would raifethem 
to the moft eminent pitch of hero- 
ick Vertue. Hither, Ladies, I de- 
fire 



1 6 A Serious Propofal 

'fire you wou'd afpire, 'tis a noble 
and becoming Ambition , and to 
remove fuch Obftacles as lie in your 
way is the defign of this Paper. We 
will therefore enquire what it is 
that flops your flight , that keeps 
you groveling here below , like 
Domitian catching Flies when you 
fhould be bufied in obtaining Em- 
pires. 

Altho' it has been faid by Men 
of more Wit than Wildom , and 
perhaps of more malice than either, 
that Women are naturally incapa- 
ble of a£Hng Prudently, or that 
they are neceffarily determined to 
folly, I muft by no means grant it ; 
that Hypothefis would render my 
endeavours impertinent, for then it 
would be in vain to advile the one, 
or endeavour theReformationof the 
other. Befides, there are Examples 
in all Ages, which fufficiently con- 
fute the Ignorance and Malice of 
this Affertion. 

Tlie Incapacity, if there be any,

is acquired not natural ; and none ^ 
of their Follies are fo neceffary, but 
that they might avoid them if they 
pleas'd themfelves. Some difad- 
vantages indeed they labour under, 
and what thefeaie we fhall fee by 
and by and endeavour to furmount ; 
but Women need not take up with 
mean things, fince (if they are not 
wanting to themfelves) they are 
capable of the beft. Neither God 
nor Nature have excluded them 
from being Ornaments to their Fa- 
milies and ufefulin their Generati- 
on ; there is therefore no reafon 
they fhould be content to be Cy- 
phers in the World, ufelefs at the 
beft, and in a little time a burden 
and nuifance to all about them. 
And 'tis very great pity that they 
who are fo apt to over-rate them- 
felves in fmaller Matters , fhou'd, 
where it moft concerns them to 
know and ftand upon their Value, 
be fb infenfible of their own worth. 
The Caufe therefore of the defefts 

we 



1 8 A Serious Propofal 

we kbour under is , if not wholly, 
yet at lea ft in the fir ft place , to be 
afcribcd to the miftakes of our E- 
dtication, which like an Error in 
the firft Conco&ion , fpreads its 
ill Influence through all our Lives. 

The Soil is rich and would if 
well cultivated produce a noble 
Harveft,if then the Unskilful Man- 
agers, not only permit, but incour- 
age noxious Weeds, tho'we (hail 
fuffer by theNeg!e£t,yetthey ought 
not in juftice to blame any but 
themfelves, if they reap the Fruit 
of this their foolifh Conduft. Wo- 
men are from their very Infancy de- 
bar'd thofe Advantages, with the 
want of which they are afterwards 
reproached, and nut-fed up in thofe 
Vices which will hereafter be up- 
braided to them.So partial are Men 
as to expe£ -Brick where they af- 
ford no Straw ; and ib abun- 
dantly civil as to take care we 
fttouM make good that obliging E- 
pithet of Ignorant, which out of an 

excefs

excels of good Manners , they are 
pleas'd to beftow on us ! 

One would be apt to think in- 
deed, that Parents fhou'd take all 
poffibie care of their Childrens E* 
ducation, not only for their fakes, 
but even for their own. And tho r 
the Son convey the Name to Pofte- 
rity, yet certainly a great Part of 
the Honour of their Families de- 
pends on their Daughters. 'Tis 
the kindnefs of Education that 
binds our duty fafteft on us ; For 
the being inftrumental to the bring- 
ing us into the World , is no mat- 
ter of choice and therefore the lefs 
obliging;But to procure that we may 
live wifely and happily in it, and 
be capable of endlels Joys hereafter, 
is a benefit we can never fuificiently 
acknowledge. To introduce poor 
Children into the World and ne- 
glefl: to fence them againft the 
temptations of it, and fb leave them 
expos'd to temporal and eternal 
Miferies, is a wickednefs for which 

I 



ao A Serious Propofal 

I want a Name ; 'tis beneath Bru- 
tality ; the Beafts are better natur'd, 
for they take care of their off- 
ering, till they are capable of car- 
ing for themfelves. And if Mo- 
thers had a due regard to their Pofte- 
rity , how Great foever they are, 
they wou'd not think themfelves 
too Good to perform what Nature 
requires, nor through Pride and 
Delicacy remit the poor little one 
to the care of a Fofter Parent. Or 
ifneceffity infcrcethem to depute 
another to perform their Duty,they 
wou'd be as choice at leaft , in the 
Manners and Inclinations, as they 
are in the completions of their 
Nurfes, left with their Milk they 
transfufe their Vices , and form in 
the Child fuch evil habits as will 
not eafily be eradicated. 

Nature as bad as it is and as much 
asit is complained of , is fb far im- 
proveable by the grace of GOD, 
upon our honeft and hearty endea- 
vours, that if we are not wanting 

to 



to the Ladies. 1 1 

to our felves,we may all mfome>\\\tf 
not in an eqttd meafiire , be inftru- 
ments of his Glory, Bleffings to this 
World , and capable of Eternal 
BlefTednefs in that to come. But 
if our Nature is fpoiPd , inftead of 
being improvM at firfl ; if from our 
Infancy we are mfrs'd up in Igno- 
rance and Vanity ; are taught to be 
Proud and Petulant , Delicate and 
Fantaftick , Humorous and Incon- 
.ftant, 'tis not ftrange that the ill ef- 
fects of this Conduct appear in alj 
the future Aftions of our Lives. 
And feeing it is Ignorance , either 
habitual or aftual, which is the caufe 
of all fin , how are they like to e- 
fcape this 9 who are bred up in that ? 
That therefore Women are unpro- 
fitable to moft , and a plague and 
dishonour to fbme men is not much 
to be regretted oh account of the 
Men, becaufe 'tis the produft of 
their own folly ? in denying them 
the benefits of an ingenuous and li- 
beral Education, the moft effectual 

means 



a a A Serious Propofal 
means to direft them into, and to 
(ecu re their progrefs in the ways of 
Vertue. 

For that Ignorance is the caufe 
of moft Feminine Vices , may be 
inftanc'd in that Pride and Vanity 
which is ufually imputed to us,and 
which Iflippofe -if throughly fifted, 
will appear to be feme way or other, 
the rife and Original of all the reft. 
Thefe, tho 5 very bad Weeds , are 
the produ£t of a good Soil, they are 
nothing elfe but Generofity degene- 
rated and corrupted. A defire to 
advance and perfeft its Being, is 
planted by GOD in all Rational 
Natures, to excite them hereby to 
every worthy and becoming A£ti- 
on ; for certainly next to the Gj ace 
of GOD, nothing does fo power- 
fully reftrain people from Evil and 
ftir them up to Good, as a generous 
Temper. And therefore to be ambi- 
tious of perfe&ions is no fault, tho' 
to aifume the Glory of ourExcellen- 
cies to our felves,or to Glory in fuch 

as 



to the Ladles. 23 

as we really have not,are. And were 
Womens haughtinefs exprefs'd in 
difdaining to do a mean and evil 
thing, wou'd they pride themfelves 
in fomewhat truly perfe£tive of a 
Rational nature, there were no hurt 
in it. But then they ought not to 
be denied the means of examining 
and judging what is (b ; they fhould 
not be imposed on with tinfel ware. 
If by reafbn of a falfe Light, or un- 
due Medium , they chufe amifs, 
theirs is the lofs , but the Crime is 
the Deceivers. She who rightly 
underftands wherein the perfe&ion 
of her Nature confifts, will lay out, 
her Thoughts and Induftry in the 
acquifition of fuch Perfections : But 
fhe who is kept ignorant of the mat- 
ter, will take up with fuch Obje£ts 
as firft offer themfelves , and bear 
any plaufible refemblance to what 
fhe defires ; a fhew of advantage 
being fufficient to render them a- 
greeable baits to her who wants 
Judgment and Skill to difcern be-

whence it eafily follows, that fhe 
who has nothing elfe to value her 
felf upon , will be proud of her 
Beauty ,orMoney and what that can 
purchafe ; and think her felf migh- 
tily oblig'd to him , who tells her 
fhe has thofe Perfe&ions which fhe 
naturally longs for. Her inbred 
felf-efteem and defire of good,which 
are degenerated into Pride and mi- 
ftaken Selfclove, will eafily open 
her Ears to. whatever goes about to 
nourifh and delight them ; and 
when a cunning defigning Enemy 
from without, has drawn over to 
his Party thefe Traytors within, he 
has the Poor unhappy Perfon , at

fwallows down his Poy fon, becaule

Thus Ignorance and a narrow

that Tyrant Cuftom , which is the 
grand motive to all thofe irrational 
choices which we daily fee made in 
the World, fb very contrary to our 
frefent intereft and pleafure, as well 
as to ourFuture. We think it an un- 
pardonable miftake not to do as our 
neighbours do v and part with our 
Peace and Pleafure as well as our 
Innocence and Vertue, meerly in 
complyance with an unreafonable 
Fafhion. And having inur'd our 
felves to Folly, we know not how 
to quit it ; we go on in Vice,not be-

For tho r the heart may be honeft ,it is

the other extream. Having more 
Heat than Light y their Zeal out-runs 
their Knowledge, and inftead of 
reprefenting Piety as it is in it felf, 
the moft lovely and inviting thing 
imaginable, they expofe it to the 
contempt and ridicule of thecenfbri- 
ous World. Their Devotion be- 
comes ricketed 3 ftarv'd and contraft- 
ed in fbmeof it's vital parts,and difc 
proportioned and over-grown in left 
material inftances ; whilft one Duty 
is over-done to commute for the neg- 
le£t of another , and the miftaken 
perfbn thinks the being often on 
her knees , attones for all the mi£ 
carriages of her Converfation : Not 
confidering that 'tis in vain to peti- 
tion for thofe Graces which we take 
no care to pra&ifc, and a mockery 
to adore thofe Perfections we run 
counter to, and that the true end 
of all our Prayers and external Gb- 
lervances is to work our minds into 
a truly Chriftian temper, to obtain 
for us the Empire of our Paffions,

G O D in Purity, Charity, and all 
his imitable excellencies, as is con- 
fident with the imperfe&ion of a 
Creature. 

And now having difcovered the 
Difeafe and its caufe, 'tis proper to 
apply a Remedy ; fingle Medicines 
are too weak to cure fuch compli- 
cated Diftempers , they require a 
full Difpenfatory ; and what wou'd 
a gopd Woman refufe to do, could 
flie hope by that to advantage the 
greateit part of the World, and im- 
prove herSex inKnowledgeand true 
Religion? I doubt not,Ladies, but 
that the Age, as bad as it is, affords 
very many of you who will readily 
embrace whatever has a true 
tendency to the Glory of GOD and 
your mutual Edification, to revive 
the ancient Spirit of Piety in the 
World and to tranfmit it to fucceed- 
ing Generations. I knbw there are 
many of you who fb ardently love 

God, 



40 A Seriom Propofal 

God, as to think no time too much 
to fpend in his fervice,nor any thing 
too difficult to do for his fake ; and 
bear fuch a hearty good will to 
your Neighbours, as to grudge no 
Prayers or Pains to reclaim and im- 
prove them- I have therefore no 
more to do but to make the Pro- 
pofal, to prove that it will anfwer 
thefe great-and good Errds,and then 
'twill be ealy to obviate theObjefti- 
ons that Perfonsof more Wit than 
Vertue may happen to raife againft 
it. 

Now as to the Propofal, it is to 
erect a Monaftery, or if you will (to 
avoid giving offence to the fcrupu- 
lous and injudicious , by names 
which tho' innocent in themfelves, 
have been abus'd by fuperftitious 
Pfa&ices,) we will call it a Religi- 
ous Retirement ,and fuch as fliall have

greateft good in it ; fuch an Inftitu- 
tion as this (if I do not mightily 
deceive my felf) would be the moft 
probable method to amend the pre- 
fent and irnprovethe future Age. 
For here thofe who are convinced 
of the emptinefs of earthly Enjoy- 
ments, who are fick of the vanity 
of the world and its impertinencies, 
may find more fubftantial and fatis- 
fying entertainments, and need not 
be confin'd to what they juftly 
loath. Thofe who are defirous to 
know- and fortify their weak fide, 
firft do good to themfelves,that here- 
after they may be capable of doing 
more good to others ; or for their 
greater fecurity are willing to avoid 
temptation, may get out of that 
danger which a continual ftay in 
view of the Enemy, and the fami- 
liarity and unwearied application 
of the Temptation may expofe them 
to ; and gain an opportunity to look 
into themfelves to be acquaint* d at

the great bufinefs they came into 
the world about , the fervice of 
GOD and improvement of their 
own-Minds, may find a convenient 
and blifsful receft from the noiie 
and hurry of the world. A world 
fb cumberfom , fo infectious , that 
altho' thro' the grace of GOD and 
their own ftrifl: watchfulnefs, they 
are kept from finking down into its 
corruptions, 'twill however damp 
their flight to heav'n, hinder them 
from attaining any eminent pitch 
of Vertue. 

You are therefore Ladies, invited 
into a place, where you fhall fuffer 
no other confinement , but to be 
kept out of the road of fin: You fhall 
not be deprived of your grandeur, 
but only exchange the vain Pomps

being only to prepare for the high-

So that you only withdraw from

revellings and amufements, which

But becaufe we were not made 
for our felves, nor can by any means 
fo effeftually glorify GOD and do 
good to our own Souls, as by doing 
Offices of Charity and Beneficence

retain all the advantages and avoid 
the inconveniencies that attend ei- 
ther. It fijail not fo cut you off

but rather qualify you to do it the

influence the reft of their Sex , that 
Women may no longer pais for 
thofe little ufelefs and impertinent 
Animals, which the illcondu£tof 
too many has caus'd 'em to be mi- 
ftaken for. 

We have hitherto confiderM our 
Retirement only in relation toReli- 
gion, which is indeed its ntain,! may 
fay its only defign ; nor can this be 
thought too contra&ing a word, 
fince Religion is the adequate bufi- 
nefs of our lives, and largely confi- 
der'd, takes in all we have to do, 
nothing being a fit employment 
for a rational Creature, which has 
not either a direB or remote tendency 
to this great and only end. But be* 
caufe,as we have all along obierv'd, 
Religion never appears in it's true 
Beauty, but when it is accompanied 
with Wifdom and Difcretion; and 
that without a good Underftand- 
ing, we can Icarce be truly, but ne-

Therefore , one great end of this 
Inftitution fhall be, to expel that 
cloud of Ignorance which Cuftom 
has involved us in , to furnifh our 
minds with a ftock of folid and ufe- 
ful Knowledge, that the Spuls of 
Women may no longer be the only 
unadorn'd and neglefted things. It 
is not intended that our Religious 
fhouM wafte their time , and trou-

To enter into the detail of the

ment of the Religious, their Offices 
ofDevotion,Employments, Work, 
&c. is not now necelTary. Suffice 
it at prefent to fignify , that they 
will be more than ordinarily careful 
to redeem their Time, (pending no 
more of it on the Body than the ne- 
ceffities of Nature require , but by 
a judicious choice of their Employ- 
ment and a conftant induftry about

in Idlenefs, nor laviih'd out in un-

And as it will be the bufinefs of

the Ax to the root of fin , and de-

will look upon thefe ho*y times of 
recolleftion and extraordinary De- 
votion (without which Fafting fig- 
nifies little) as excellent means to 
keep it down , and to pluck up e- 
very the leaft Fibre that may hap- 
pen to remain in them. But we in- 
tend not by this to impofe any in- 
tolerable burden on tender Confti- 
tutions, knowing that our Lord has 
taught us , that Mercy is to be pre- 
fer'd before Sacrifice : and that 
Bodily Exercifeprofiteth but a little, 
the chief bufinefs being to obtain a 
a divine and God-like temper of

ver difagree, provided we miftake 
not the one ? nor indulge the petu- 
lancy of the other ; there being no 
Difplacencies in Religion, but what 
we our felves have unhappily made

the higheft Epcurifm ? exalting our

they may be quickly refoly'd on 
by the Ladies who fhall fubfcribe ; 
who I doubt not will make choice 
of what is moft plain and decent, 
what Nature not Luxury requires. 
And fince neither Meat nor Cloaths 
commend us unto GOD , they'll 
content themfelves with fuch things 
as are fit and convenient , without* 
occafioning fcruple to themfelves 
or giving any trouble or offence to 
others. She who confiders to how 
much better account that Money 
will turn which is beftow'd on the 
Poor /than that which is laid out 
in unneceflary Expences on her (elf, 
meeds no Admonitions again ft fii- 
perfluities. She who truly loves 
her felf, will never wafte fliar 
Money on a decaying Carkafs, 
which if prudently disbursed wou'd' 
procure her an eternal Manfioir. 
She will never think her felf fb fine, 
as when the backs of the Poor do 
blefs her j and never feaft fb luxu- 
riously as when (he treats an hun-

gry perfon. No perfume will be 
thought fo grateful as the Odour of 
Good Works , nor any Wafli fb 
beautifying as her own tears. For 
her Heroick Soul is too great to am- 
bition any Empire but that of her 
ov/nBreaft, or to regard any other 
Conqucft than the refilling poor 
unhappy Souls from the flavery of 
Sin and Satan, thofe only unfup- 
portable Tyrants ; and therefore 
what Decays fhe obferves in her 
face will be very unconcerning, but 
flie will with greateft fpeed and 
accuracy rectify the leaft Spot that 
may prejudice the beauty of her 
lovely Soul. 

In a word, this happy Society 
will be but one Body , whole Soul 
is love, animating and informing it, 
and perpetually breathing forth it 
felf in flames of holy defires after 
GOD and afts of Benevolence to 
each other. Envy and Uncharita- 
blenefs are the Vices only of little 
and narrow hearts ,. and therefore 

'tis 



66 A Serious Propofal 

'tis fupposM , they will not enter 
here amongft perfbns whole Dit 
pofitionsas well as their Births are 
to be Generous. Cenfiire will re- 
fine into Friendly Admonition, all 
Scoffing and offenfive Railleries will 
be abominated and banifhM hence, 
where not only the Words and 
A£tions;but even the very Thoughts 
and Defires of the Religious tend to 
promote the moft endearing Love 
and univerfal Good-will. Thus 
thefe innocent and holy Souls fbou'd 
run their Race , meafuring their 
hours by their Devotions, and their 
days by the charitable Works they 
do. Thus wou'd they live the life 
of Heaven whilft on Earth, and re- 
ceive an Earneft of its Joys in their 
hearts, And now, what remains 
for them to do at Night, but to re- 
view the Actions of the Day ? to 
examine what Paffions have been 
ftirring ? How their Devotions 
were performed ? in what temper 
their Hearts are ? what good they 

have.

made towards Heaven ? and with 
the plaudit of a fatisfied Confcience 
fweetly to deep in peace and fafety, 
-Angels pitching their Tents round 
about them, and he that neither 
flumbers nor fieeps rejoycing over 
them to do them good. 
And to the end that thefe great de- 
figns may be the better purfu'd and 
effe&ually obtained, care fhall be 
taken that our Religious be under 
the tuition of perfons of irreproach- 
able Lives, of a confummate Pru- 
dence, fincere Piety and unaffefted 
Gravity. No Novices in Religion, 
but fuch as have fpent the greateft 
part of their lives in the ftudy and 
praftice of Chriftianity ; who have 
lived much, whatever the time of 
their abode in the world has been.

of thole inconveniencies to which 
Ladies are expos'd by living in the 
World , and in the next place the 
pofitive advantages of a Retreat. 

And firft , as to the inconveni- 
ences of living in the World ; no 
very fmall one is that ftrong Idea 
and warm perception it gives us of 
its Vanities ; fince thefe are ever at 
hand , conftantly thronging about

all other Objects , and the Mind 
being prepoffefsM and gratefully 
entertained with thofe pleafing Per- 
ceptions which external Objects oc- 
cafion , takes up with them as its 
only Good , is not at leifure to raft

as it derives from fenfation , being 
unacquainted with thofe more ex- 
cellent ones which arife from its 
own operations and a ferious refle- 
xion on them, and which are nece£ 
fary to correfl: the miftakes and 
fupply the defefts of the other. 
From whence arifes a very partial 
knowledge of things, nay, almoft 
a perfeft ignorance in things of the 
greateft moment. For tho' we are 
acquainted with the Sound of fbme 
certain words, viz,. God, Religion, 
PleafureznA Paw, Honour and D//- 
honour, and the like ; yet having no 
other lde&s but what are convey'd 
to us by thofe Trifles we converfe 
with,we frame to our felves ftrange 
andawkard notions of them, con- 
formable only to thofe Ideas fenfati-

thefe Objects are thick in our 
way. • 

Thus fhe who fees her felf and 
others refpefted in proportion to 
that Pomp and Buftle they make 
in the world, will form her Idea of 
Honour accordingly. She who has 
relifh'd no Pleafures but fiich as a- 
rife at the pretence of outward Ob- 
jects, will feek no higher than her 
Senfes for her Gratification. And 
thus we may account for that 
ftrange infallibility , that appears 
in fbme people when you fpeak to 
them of any ferious Religious mat- 
ter. They are then fo dull you'll 
have much ado to make them un- 
derftand the cleareft Truth : Where- 
as if you rally the fame perfons, or 
chat with them of fome Mode or 
Foppery, they'll appear very quick, 
expert , and ingenious. I have 
fometimes foilPd betwixt (corn and 
pity, to hear Women talk as grave- 
ly and concernedly about fome tri- 
fling dif&ppointment from their

Milliner or Taylor, as if it had re- 
lated to the weightieft concerns of 
their Souls , nay , perhaps more 
ierioufly than others who wou'd 
pals for Good, do about their eter- 
nal Intereft ; but turn the talk that 
way, and they grow as heavy and 
cold as they were warm and fenfi- 
ble before. And whence is this, but 
becaufe their heads are full of the 
one , and quite deftitute of fuch 
Ideas as might give them a compe- 
tent notion of the other, and there- 
fore to difcourfe of fuch matters, is 
. as little to the purpofe as to make 
Mathematical Demonftrations to 
one who knows not what an Angle 
or Triangle means. Hence by the 
way, will appear the great ufeful- 
nefs of judicious Catechiz;ing,which 
is neceifary to form clear Ideas in 
the mind, without which it can re- 
ceive but little benefit from the Dif 
courfes of the Pulpit , and perhaps 
the negle£k of the former , is the 
reafon that the great plenty of the 
u 2 latter 



7 6 A Serious Propofal 

latter has no better effeft. By all 
which it appears, that if we wou'd 
not be impos'd on by falfe Repre- 
fentations and Impoftures , if we 
wou'd obtain a due knowledge of 
rhe moft important things,we muft 
remove the little Toys and Vanities 
of the world from us, orcurfelves 
from them ; enlarge our Ideas, feek 
out newFields of knowledge,where- 
by to reftify our firft miftakes. 

From the fame Original , viz. 
the conftant flattery of external 
Objects, arifes that queruloufnefs 
and delicacy cbfervable in moft Per- 
fbns of fortune , and which betrays 
them to many inconveniencies. For 
befides that it renders them altoge- 
ther unfit to bear a change, which 
confidering the great uncertainty 
and fwift viciflitudes of worldly 
things, the Greateft and moft efta-

will very rarely find all things to 
their mind , and then fbme little 
difbrder which others wou'd take 
no notice of, like an aching Tooth 
or Toe, fpoils the relifli of their 
Joys. And tho' many great Ladies 
affect this ternper,miftaking it for a 
piece of Grandeur, 'tis fb far from 
that, that it gives evidence of a 
poor weak Mind, a very childifh 
Humour , that muft be cocker'd 
and fed with Toys and Baubles to 
ftill its frowardnefs, and is like the 
crazy ftomach of a fick Perfbn, 
which no body has reafbn to be 
fond of or defire. 

Thisalfb difpofes them to Incon- 
ftancy, for flie who is continually 
fupply'd with variety knows hot 
where to fix ; a Vice which fome 
Women feem to be proud of,and yet 
nothing in the world To reproachful 
and degrading, becaufe nothing is a 
ftronger indication of a weak and 
injudicious mind. For it fuppofts

wrong Choice at fir ft , or elfe fb 
filly as not to know and ftick to it, 
when we have made a right one. 
It befpeaks an unthinking ineonfi- 
derate Mind, one that lives at Ran- 
dom , without any defign or end ; 
who wanting judgment to difcern 
where to fix,or to know when fhe's 
well, is ever fluctuating and uncer- 
tain, undoing to day what fhe had 
done yefterday, which is the worft 
Character that can be given of ones 
Underftanding. 

A conftant Scene of Temptations 
and the infection 6i ill company, is 
another great danger which con- 
verting in the world expofes to. 
'Tis a dangerous thing to have all 
the opportunities of finning in our 
power, and the danger is increas'd 
by the ill Precedents we daily fee 
of thofe who take them. Liberty 
(as fbme body fays) will corrupt an 
Angel, and tho' it is indeed more 
glorious to conquer than to fly, yet 
fince our Vertue is fo vifibly weak-

us, either of Teeming rude to

fcarce avoid being aftive or paflive 
in it ; fb that (lie who has not her

In confequence of all this, we are

infenfibly betray'd to a great lofs of 
time, a Treafure whofe value we 
are too often quite ignorant of till 
it be loft paft redemption. And yet 
confidering the fhortnefs and uncer- 
tainty of Life, the great work we 
have to do, and what advantages 
accrew to us by a due management 
of our time , we cannot reconcile it 
with prudence to fuffer the leaft 
minute to eftape us. But befides 
our own lavifh Expences concerning 
which one may ask as Solomon does 
of Labour, What Fruit have rve of all 
that Sport and Pajlime we have taken

the- humour of the World, that 
thofe who wouM reckon it a rude-

us of this infinitely more precious 
Treafure. 

In the laft place,by reafcn of this 
lofs of time and the continual hurry 
we are in, we can find no oppor-

colle&ion ; we are fo bufied with 
what pafles abroad, that we have 
no leifure to look at home,nor to re- 
ftifie the diforders there.And fuch 
an unthinking mechanical way of 
living, when like Machines we are 
condemned every day to repeat the 
impertinencies of the day before, 
fhortens our Views, contracts our 
Minds , expofes to a thoufand 
praftical Errors, and renders Im- 
provement impoffible , becaufe it 
will not permit us to confider and 
recolleft, which is the only means 
to attain it. So much for the in- 
conveniences of living in the World ; . 
if we enquire concerning Retire- 
ment, we fhall find it does not only 
remove allrhefe, but brings confi- 
derable advantages of its own. 

For firft , it helps us to mate 
Guftom and delivers us from its Ty- 
ranny, which is the mod ccnfider-

rile us to it. But how hard is it to 
quit an old road ? What courage 
as well as prudence does it require ? 
How clear a judgment to overlook 
the Prejudices of Education and Ex- 
ample and to difcern what is heft, 
and how ftrong a Refblution not- 
withftanding all theScofs andNoifes 
of the world to adhere to it?For Cu- 
ftom has ufurpt fiich an unaccount-

endeavour to put a ftop to its Arbi- 
trary Sway and reduce it to Reafbn, 
is in a fair way to render her felf 
the Butt for all the Fops in Town

not value their Cenfure , yet fhe 
cares not to be the fubjefl: of their 
Difcourfe*. The only way then 
.is to retire from the World, as the 
Ifraelites did out of jEgyft, left the 
Sacrifice we muft make of its 
Pollies fhou'd provoke its Spleen. 

This alfo puts us out of the road 
of Temptation, and very much re-

begin to wonder at our Folly, that 
amongft all the pleafures we for-

to that moft noble and delicious

of truth ; and bfcfs our felves at laft, 
that our eyes are open'd to difcern, 
how much morepleafantly we may

we are fitted to receive the influen- 
ces of the holy Spirit and are put in 
a .due. frame of Devotion. No doubt 
but He has often knockM at the 
door of our hearts, when the croud 
and noifeof our Vanities would not 
iuffer us to regard or hear him, and 
could find no admittance when our 
Loufewasfb fill'd will other com-

place for his Entertainment , for 
being freed from outward diftur- 
fc&nces, we are entirely at leifureto

attend fo divine a Gueft. Our De- 
votions will be performed with due 
attention , thofe Obje&s that ufed 
to diftraft being now remov'd 
from us ; fimplicity of defire will 
beget fimplicity of thought , and 
that will make our mind moft in- 
tense and elevated, when we come 
to addrefs our felves to the Throne 
of Grace. Being dead to the things 
of this world, we (hall with great- 
eft fervour petition for thofe of ano- 
ther ; and living always in a lively 
and awful fenfe of the divine Ma- 
jefty , our hearts will ever be difc

fblemn,ferious and reverent manner. 
' Tis a very unfeemly thing to jump 
from our Diverfions to our Prayers ; 
as if when we have been entertain- 
ing our felves and others with Va* 
nity, we were inftantly prepared to 
appear in the facred prefence of 
GOD. But a Religous Retirement

by obtain truer Notions of GOD 
than w r e were capable of before, 
which is of very great confequence, 
fince the want of right apprehenfi-

caufe of Miftakes in Religion , of 
Errors in Speculation, and Inde-

impofes on them. Things which 
contribute lb very little to our real

and wou'd certainly reclaim us from 
the immoderate love of earthly en- 
joyments , did we but ferioufly 

hearken: 



88 A. Serious Propofal 

hearken to it. For tell me,Ladies, 
if your greateft Pleafures are not 
attended with a greater fling; 
when you think tografp them , do 
they not either vanifh into Air, or 
gall your fingers ? To want or to 
enjoy them, is equally tormenting ; 
the one produces in you the Pain of 
Hunger the other of Loathing. For 
in reality, there is no good in them, 
nothing but the Shadow and Ap- 
pearance ; if there were, you cou'd 
not fo eafily loath your old Delights 
and be Co fond of variety , what is 
truly defirable never ending in di£ 
guft. They are not therefore Plea- 
lures but Amufements which you 
now purfue, and which , through 
your ignorance of better Joys pre- 
tend to fill their place, toll you on 
with fair pretences and repay your 
Labour with defeated Hopes. Joys 
not near fo lafting as the flighted 
toy you wear, the moft capricious 
Humorift among you is more con- 
ftant far than they. Come hither 

there- 



to the Ladies. . 89 

therefore and take a true view of 
'em, that you may no longer de- 
ceive your felves with that which 
profits not , but lpurning away 
thefe empty nothing?, {ecu re a por- 
tion in fuch a Blifs as will not fail, 
as cannot difappoint you ! A Felici- 
ty which depending on G O D on- 
ly and your own Minds , is out of 
Fortunes reach, will place you a- 
bove the Batteries of the world, a- 
boveits Terrors and Allurements, 
and enable you at once to triumph 
over* and de{pife ir. And what 
can be more glorious, than to have 
a mind unfhakcn by the blandifh- 
mentsof Profperity, or the rough 
{hocks of Adverfity ; that paffes 
thro 5 both with the fame indiflferen- 
cy and integrity, is not to be tem- 
pted by either to a mean unworthy 
and indecent Aftion ? 

Farther yet, befides that holy 
emulation which a continual view 
of the brighteft and moft exemplary 
Lives will excite in us, we fhall 

have 



90 A Serious Propofal 

have opportunity of contra&ingthe 
pureft and nobleft Friendship; a 
Bleffing , the purchafe of which 
were richly worth all the World 
befides ! For fhe who poffeffes a 
worthy Perfbn , has certainly ob- 
tained the richeft Treafure. A Blef- 
fing that Monarchs may envy, and 
flie who enjoys is happier than fhe 
who fills a Throne ! A Bleffing, 
which next to the love of G O D, is 
the choiceft Jewel in our Celeftial 
Diadem ; which, were it duly. pra- 
ctised wou'd both fit us for Heav'n 
and bring it down into our hearts 
whiift we tarry here. For Friend- 
fhip is a vertue which comprehends 
all the reft ; none being fit for this, 
who is not adornM with every o- 
ther Vertue. Probably one confi- 
derable caufe of the degeneracy of 
the prefent Age , is the little true 
Friendship that is to be found in it ; 
or perhaps you will rather fay that 
this is the effeft of our corruption. 
The caufe and the effect are indeed 

reciprocal y 



to the Ladies. 9 I 

reciprocal ; for were the World 
better there wou'd be more Friend- 
fhip, and were there more Friend- 
fhip we fhou'd have a betterWor Id. 
But becaufe Iniquity abounds, there- 
fore the love of many is not only 
waxen cold, but quite benumb'd 
and perifhM. But if we have fuch 
narrow hearts,be fbfull of miftaken 
Self-love, fo unreafonably fond of 
our felves, that we cannot fpare a 
hearty Good-will to one or two 
choice -Perfbns, how can it ever be 
thought , that we fhou'd well ac- 
quit our felves of that Charity 
which is due to all Mankind ? For 
Friendfhip is nothing elfe but 
Charity contrafted ; it is (in the 
words of an admired Author) a 
kind of revenging our felves on the 
narrownefs of our Faculties, by ex- 
emplifying that extraordinary 
Charity on one or two , which we 
are willing, but not able to exercife 
towards all. And therefore 'tis 
without doubt the beft Inftru&or 

to 



91 A Serious Propofal 

to teach us our duty to our Neigh- 
bour, and a moft excellent Monitor 
to excite us to make payment as far 
as our power will reach. It has a fpe- 
cial force to dilate our hearts, to 
deliver them from that vicious 
fe/fifbnefs and the reft of thofe fordid 
Paflions which exprefs a narrow 
illiberal temper, and are of fuch per- 
nicious confequence to Mankind. 
That inftitution therefore muft 
needs be highly beneficial, which 
both difpofes us to be Friends our 
felves and helps to find them. But 
by Friendfhip I do not mean any 
thing like thofe intimacies that are 
abroad in the World , which are 
often combinations in evil and at 
beft but infignificant dearnefTes, as 
little refembling true Friendfhip,as 
modern Practice does Primitive 
Chriftianity. But I intend by it 
the greateft ufefulnefs, the moft re- 
fin'd and difinterefs'd Benevolence, 
a love that thinks nothing within 
the bounds of Power and Duty, too 

much 



to the Ladies. 9 5 

much to do or fuffer for its Belov- 
ed ; And makes no diftinftion be- 
twixt its Friend and its felf, ex- 
cept that in Temporals it prefers 
her intereft. But tho' it be very 
defirable to obtain fuch a Treafure, 
fiich a Medicine of Life as the wife 
manfpeaks, yet the danger is great 
leaft being deceiv'd in our choice, 
we fuck in Poyfbn where we ex- 
pefted Health. And confidering 
how apt we are to difguife our 
felves, how hard it is to know our 
own hearts much lefs anothers, it 
is not advifable to be too hafly in 
contrafting fo important a Relati- 
on ; before that be done, it were 
well if we could look into the very 
Soul of the beloved Perfbn, to di£ 
cover what refemblance it bears to 
our own, and in this Society we 
fhall have the beft opportunities of 
doing fb. There are no Interefts 
heretoferve, no contrivances for 
another to be a ftale to ; the Souls 
of all the Reltgious will be open and 

free, 



94. -A Seriom Propofal 
free, and thofe particular Friend- 
fhips mull be no prejudice to the 
general Amity. But yet, as in 
Heav'n that region of perfeft Love, 
the^ happy Souls (as fomeareofo- 
pinion) now and then ftep afide 
from more general Conversions, 
to entertain themfelves with a pe- 
culiar Friend ; fb, in this little em- 
blem of that bleffed place , what 
fhou'd hinder, but that two Perfons 
of a fympatbizing difpofition , the 
make and frame of whole Souls bears 
an exaft conformity to each other, 
and therefore one wou'd think 
were purpofely de'fign'd by Heaven 
to unite and mix ; what fhou'd 
hinder them from entering into an 
holy combination to watch over 
each other for Good, to advife^ en- 
courage and da eft, and to oblerve 
the minuteft fault in order to its a- 
mendment.The trueft effect of love 
being to endeavour the bettering

nothing is more likely to improve

us in Vertue, and advance us to 
the very higheft pitch ofGoodnefs 
than unfeigned Friendfbip, which 
is the molt beneficial, as well as 
the mod pleafant thing in the 
world. 

But to haften; fuch an Inftitution 
will much comfirm us in Vertue 
and help us to perfevere to the end, 
and by that fubftantial Piety and 
lolid Knowledge we fhall here ac- 
quire, fit us to propagate Religion 
when we return into the World. An 
habitual Pra&ice of Piety for fbme 
years will fb root and eftablifh us 
in it , that Religion will become a 
fecond Nature, and we rauft do 
ftrange violences to our felves, if 
after that we dare venture to oppofe 
it. For befides all the other Advan- 
tages that Vertue has over Vice,this 
will difarm it of Cufiom , the only

And though at firft I propos'd to 
my felfto fpeak nothing in particu-

ons, yet to give a Specimen how ufe- 
ful they will be to the World, I am 
now inclined to declare,that it is de-

to give the beft Education to the 
Children of Perfons of Quality ,who 
Jhall be attended andinftru&ed in

of their minds fhall be the particular 
care of thofe of their own Rank, 
who cannot have a more pleafant 
and ufeful employment than to ex- 
ercife and encreafe their own know- 
ledge , by inftilling it into thele 
young ones , who are moft like to 
profit under fuch Tutors. For bow 
can their little Pupils forbear to ere* 
ditthem , fince they do not decry 
£he* World (as others may be

thought to do) becaufe they cou'd 
not enjoy it,but when they bad it in 
their power , were courted and ca- 
refs'd by it, for very go6d Reafbns 
and on mature deliberation,thought 
fit to relinquish and defpife its offers 
for a better choice ? Nor are merce- 
nary people on other accounts capa- 
ble of doing fo much good to young 
Perfcns ; becaufe having often but 
fhort views of things thernfelves, 
fordid and low Spirits, they are not 
like to form a generous temper in 
the minds of the Educated. Doubt- 
lefs 'twas well confider'd of him, 
who wou'd not truft the breeding of 
his Son to a Slave, becaufe nothing 
great or excellent could be expe&ed 
from a perfon of that condition. 

And when by the increafe of their 
Revenue, the Religious are enabled 
to do fuch a work of Charity , the 
Education they defign tobeftow on

hereby many Souls will be preferv^d 
from great Dishonours and put in a 
comfortable way of fubfifting, being 
either received into theHoufc if they 
incline to it , or otherwife difposM 
of. It being fuppos'd that prudent 
Men will reckon the endowments 
they here acquire a fufficient Dowry , 
and that a difci eet and vertuousGen- 
tiewoman will make a better Wife 
than (lie whofc mind is empty tho' 
her Purfe be full. 

But fbme will fay, May not Peo- 
ple be good Without this confine- 
ment ? may they not live at large in

as acceptably as here ? 'Tis allow'd 
they may 5 truly wife and vertuous 
Souls will do it by the rffiftance of 
G O D's Grace in defpite of all 
temptations ; and I heartily wifh 
that all Women were of this tem- 
per. But it is to be confider'd,that 
there are tender Vertues who need 
to be fcreened from the ill Airs of 
the World : many perfons who had 

begun 



to the Ladies. 103 

begun well might have gone to the 
Grave in peace and innocence , had 
it not been their misfortune to be 
violently tempted. For thofe who 
have honed Hearts have not always 
the ftrongeft Heads ; and fome- 
times the enticements of the World 
and the fubtil infinuations of fuch 
as lie in wait to deceive, may make- 
their Heads giddy, ftagger their 
Refblutions, and overthrow all the 
fine hopes of a promifing beginning. 
'Tis fit therefore, fuch tender Cjons 
fhouM be tranfplanted , that they 
may be iiipported by the prop of 
Vertuous Friendfhip, and confirmed 
in Goodnefs by holy Examples, 
which alas ! they will not often 
meet with in the World. And, 
fuch is the weaknefs of humarte Na- 
ture, bad People are not fb apt to 
be better'd by the Society of the 
Good,as the Good are to be corrupt- 
ed by theirs.Since therefore we daily 
pray againft temptation, it cannot 
be amifs if we take all prudent care

to avoid it,and not out of a vain pre- 
emption face the danger which 
GOD may juftly permit to over- 
come us for a due correction of our 
Pride. It is not impoffible for a 
man to live in an infefted Houfe or 
Town and efcape with Life and 
Health, yet if he have a place in 
the Country to retire to , he will 
not make flight of that advantage 1 
and furely the Health of our Souls 
is of greater confideration than the 
health of our Bodies. Befides, (he

What now remains, but to reduce to 
Practice that which tends fo very much 
to our advantage. Is Charity fo dead 
in the world that none will contribute

our Money to purchafe Vanity, and of-

whatever borders on Envy and Malice, 
and with impartial eyes to behold the 
Beauties of our Religious. The native 
innocency and unaffe&ednefs of vvhofe 
Charms, and the unblameable Integrity 
of their Lives, are abundantly more 
taking than all the curious Artifices 
and Itudied Arts the other can invent 
to recommend them , even bad men 
themfelves being Judges , who often 
betray a fecret Veneration for that 
vertue they wou'd feem to defpife and 
endeavour to corrupt. As there is not 
any thing, no not the leaft fhadow of a 
motive to recommend Vice but its fa- 
ihicnablenefs and the being accufcom'd 
to it, fo there is nothing at all forbidden 
in Vertue but her uncouthnefs. Ac- 
quaint your felves with her a little, and 
you'll wonder how you cou'd be fo foolifh

into all your Enjoyments , and make

nament, and renders a Woman glorious

real worth, that like a Diamond it lofes

Whereas, fhe who is advanc'd to Tome

liable they are to decay , and how foon 
they may be depriv'dof them, and that 
fuppofing they fhouM continue , they

with but a little Cenfure and fome 
Commendations ; or if there are a

Commendation you can beftow on

Is it the difficulty of attaining the

managing their Fortunes and regula-

matter'd not much the poverty and

taught them perhaps to repeat their 
Catechifm and a few good Sentences,

Capacities which probably were af-

they're willing to repair it and very

them to confider that there's no 
Ignorance fo fhameful, no Folly fo 
abfurd as that which refufes Inftru-

may. All good Perfons will pity not 
upbraid their former unhappinefs, as

they coud not, but becaufe they wotid 
not be better Informed. But where is 
the fhame of being taught ? for who

Human Knowledge is at beft defe-

that fhe who knows the moft has on-

haps we may out-ftrip 'em, as the 
Penitent often does him who needs 
no Repentance. The worft that can 
be is the perifhing in a glorious at- 
tempt, and tho we fhou'd happen to 
prove fucceflefs, 'tis yet worth our

But there's no fear of ill fuccefs it we

CHAR I. 

Of the Mutual Relation between Ig- 
norance and Vice , and Know- 
ledge and Purity. 

WHAT are Ignorance and 
Vice but Difeafes of 
the Mind contra&ed in 
its two principal Faculties the Un- 

derftand- 



24 The Second Part of the 

derftanding and Will ? And fuch 
too as like many Bodily diftempers 
do mutually foment each other. Ig- 
norance difpofes to Vice, and Wick* 
ednefs reciprocally keeps us Igno- 
rant, fo that we cannot be free from 
the one unlefs we cure the other; 
the former part of this Propofition 

has been already fhewn, 
asf d-k Page an d tlie latter may eafily 

be made apparent; for 
as every Plant does Naturally draw 
fuch juices towards it as ferve for 
its Nutrition, as every Creature has 
an aptnefs to take fuch courfes as 
tend to its prefervation ; fo Vice that 
fpawn of the Devil, that Ignis fatu- 
us which can't fubfift but in the 
dark night of Ignorance, cafts forth 
Vapours and Mifts to darken the 
Soul and eclipfe the clear light of 
Knowledge from her View. And 
tho a Wicked Man may pretend to 
Wit, tho he have never fo much 
Acumen and Facetioufnefs of Hu- 
mour, yet his Impiety proclaims his 

Folly ; 



Propofal to the Ladies. 2 5 

Folly ; he may have a lively Fancy, 
an Intriguing Cunning and Con* 
trivance, and fo may an Ape or a 
Fox, who probably if they had but 
Speech, tho deftitute of Reafon, 
wou'd outdo him in his own way ; 
but he wants the Ingenuity of a 
Man, he's a Fool to all Kationat 
Intents and Purpofes. She then 
who defires a clear Head mufthave 
a pure Heart; and (he who has the 
firft in any Meafure will never al- 
low her felfto be deficient in the 
other. But you will fay what de- 
grees of Purity are requifite in order 
to Knowledge, and how much muft 
we Know to the end we may hear* 
tily endeavour to Purify ? 

Now in Order to fatisfie this de- 
mand I confider, That there are cer- 
tain Notices which we may call the 
Rudiments of Knowledge, which 
none who are Rational are without 
however they came by them. It may 
happen indeed that a habit of Vice 
or a long dilute has fo obfcurM them 
. C that 



2 6 The Second Part of the 

that they feem to beextinguiflu^but 
it does only feem lb, for were they 
really extinguifh'd the perfbn wou'd 
be no longer Rational, and no bet- 
ter than the Shade and Pifture of a 
Man. Becaule as Irrational Crea- 
tures a£t only by the Will of him 
who made thero, and according to 
the Power of that Mechanifme by 
which they are form'd, lb every 
one who pretends to Reafon, who is 
a Voluntary Agent and therefore 
Worthy of Praife or Blame, Reward 
or Punifhment, muft Chufe his Acti- 
ons and determine his Will to that 
Choice by lome Reafonings or Prin- 
ciples either true or falfe, and in 
proportion to his Principles and the 
Confequences he deduces from them 
he is to be accounted, if they are 
Right and Conclufive a Wile Man, 
if Evil, Ra(h and Injudicious a Fool. 
If then it be the property of Ratio* 
nal Creatures, and Effential to their 
very Natures to Chule their Aftions, 
and to determine their Wills to that 

Choice 



Propofal to the Ladies. 2 J 

Choice by fuch Principles and Rea- 
fonings as their Underftandings are 
furnilh'd with, they who are defi- 
rous to be rank'd in that Order of 
Beings muft conduQ: their Lives by 
thefe Meafures, begin with their 
Jntelle&uals , inform themfelves 
what are the plain and firft Princi- 
ples of Aftion and A& according- 

By which it appears that there 
are lbme degrees of Knowledge ne- 
ceffary before there can be any Hu- 
man A&s, for till we are capable of 
Chufing our own Anions and direft- 
ing them by fome Principle, tho we 
Move and Speak and do many fuch 
like things, we live not the Life of 
a Rational Creature but only of an 
Animal. If it be farther demanded 
what thefe Principles are } Not ta 
difpute the Number of 'em here, 
no body I fuppofe will deny us one, 
which is, That we ought as much as 
we can to endeavour the Perfe&ing 
of our Beings, and that we be as happy 
C 2 at 



2 8 The Second Part of the 

as fofflbly tve may. For this we fee 
is Natural to every Creature of 
what fort fbever, which endeavours 
to be in as good Condition as its 
Nature and Circumftances will per- 
mit. And now we have got a Prin- 
ciple which one would think were 
fufficient for the Conduft of our 
A&ions thro the whole Courfe of 
our Lives ; and fo indeed it were, 
cou'd we as eafily difcern wherein 
our Happinefs confifts as 'tis natu- 
ral to will} and defire it. But herein 
lies our great miftake and misfor- 
tune, for altho we all purfue the fame 
end, yet the means we take to ob- 
tain it are Indefinite : There needs 
no other Proof of this than the look- 
ing abroad into the World, which 
will convince us of the Truth and 
raife our Wonder at the abfurdity, 
that Creatures of the fame Make 
ihou'd take not only fo many dif- 
ferent, but evea contrary Ways to 
accomplifh the fame End ! We all 
agree that its fit to be as Happy as 

we 



Propofal to the Ladies. 2 9 

we can, and we need no Inftru£tor 
'to teach us this Knowlege, 'tis born 
with us, and is infeparable from our 
Being, but we very much need to 
be Inform'd what is the true Way to 
Happinefs. When the Will comes 
to ask the Underftanding this 
Queftion, What muft I do to fill up 
my Vacuities, to accomplish my Na- 
ture > Our Reafon is at fir ft too 
weak, and afterwards too often too 
much fophifticated to return a proper 
Anfwer, tho it be the moft impor- 
tant concern of our Lives,for accord- 
ing as the Underftanding replies to it 
Co is the Moral Conduft: of the Will, 
pure and right if the firft be well 
Inform'd, irregular and vitious if 
the other be weak and deluded. In- 
deed our power of Willing exerts 
it felf much fooner than that Ratio- 
nal Faculty which is to Govern it, 
and therefore 'twill either be left to 
its own range, or to the Reafon of 
another to direft it ; whence it 
C 3 comes 



5 o The Second Part of the 

comes that we generally take that 
Courfe in our fearch after Happi- 
nefs, which Education, Example or 
Cuftom puts us in, and, tho not 
always, yet moft commonly, we 
taft of our firft feafoning ; which 
jfhou'd teach us to take all the care 
we can that it be Good, and like- 
wife that how Good fbever it ap- 
pear, we be not, too much Wedded 
xo and biafs'd by it. Well then, the 
firft light of our Underftanding muft 
be borrow'd, we muft take it on 
truft. till we're furnifh'd with a Stock 
of our own, which we cannot long 
be without if we do but employ 
what was lent us in the purifying of 
our Will, for as this grows more 
regular the other will enlarge, if it 
clear up, that will brighten and fhine 
forth with diffufive Rays. 

Indeed if we fearch to the bottom 
I believe we fhall find, that the Cor- 
ruption of the Heart contributes 
more to the Cloudinefs of the Head 

than 



Propofal to the Ladies. 3 1 

than the Clearnefs of our Light does 
to the regularity of our Afteftions, 
and 'tis oftner feen that our vitious 
Inclinations keep us Ignorant, than 
that our Knowlege makes us Good, 
For itmuft beconfefs'd that Purity 
is not always the produfl: of Know- 
lege; thothe Underftanding be ap- 
pointed by the Author of Nature to 
direft and Govern the Will, yet ma- 
ny times it's head- ftrong and Rebel* 
lious Subje£t rufhes on precipitate- 
ly, not only without, but againft 
its dire&ions. When a Truth comes 
thwart our Paffions, when it dares

and fuppofed Interefts, let the Light 
fhine never fo clear we fbutour Eyes

becaufe there's any want of Evidence,

he may gratify thefe. Yet this is no 
Objection againft what we have been 
proving, it rather confirms what 
was faid concerning the mutual 
Relation between the Underftand-

neceflary it is to take care of both, 
if we wou'd improve and advance 
either.

neceffary to th'obtaining Purity of 
Heart. For tho fome Perfbns whom 
we vulgarly call Ignorant may be ho- 
neft and Vertuous, yet they are not 
fo in thefe particulars in which they 
are Ignorant, ±>ut their Integrity in 
Pra&ifing what they know, tho it be 
but little, caufes us to overlook that 
wherein they Ignorantly tranfgreft. 
But then any eminent degree of 
Knowlege, efpecially of Moral and 
Divine,Knowlege,which is mod ex- 
cellent becaufe moft neceffary and 
ufeful, can never be obtained without 
confiderable degrees of Purity : And 
afterwards when we have procur'd 
a competent meafure of both, they 
mutually affift each other ; the more 
Pure we are the clearer will our 
Knowlege be, and the more we 
Know the more we fhall Purify.

imperfeft fbever it be? I will not a- 
bufe the Word fo much, us rather 
an ungenerous inglorious Lazinefs, 
we doze on in a Circle with our 
Neighbours, and fo we get but 
Company and Idlenefs enough, we 
confider not for what we were made, 
and what the Condition of our pre- 
fent State requires. And we think 
our felves> good humble Creatures 
for this, who bufy not our Heads 
with what's out of our Sphere and 
was never defign'd for us, but ac- 
quiefce honeftly and contentedly in 
luch Employments as the generality 
of Women have in all Ages been en- 
gaged in ; for why fhou'd we think 
lo well of our felves as to fancy we 
can be wifer and better than thofe 
who have gone before ? They went 
to Heav n no doubt, and we hope 
that by treading in their fteps we 

like-

like'vvife in due time may come 
there, And why fhould we give 
our felves any farther trouble > 
The lowett degree of Blifs in that 
happy place is more than we de- 
ferve, and truly we have too much 
Humility and Modefty to be Ambi- 
tious of a higher. 

Thus we hide our faults under 
the borrowed name of Vertue ; an 
old device taught us by the Enemy 
of our Souls,and by which he has oft- 
en deceiv'd us. But 'tis all miftake 
and nonfenfe to hope to get to Hea- 
ven, if weftintour Endeavours and 
care for no more but juft to get 
there. For what's at the bottom 
of this pretended humble temper ? 
No real Love to GOD and long- 
ing to enjoy him, no appetite for 
Heaven, but fince we muft go thi- 
ther or to Hell when we quit this 
dear beloved World, a taking up 
with that as the more tolerable 
place. Had we indeed any true 
Idea of the Life to come, did we

but fix our Eyes and Thoughts in 
the Contemplation of that uncon- 
ceivable BleiTednefe , twou'd be 
importable not to defire it with the 
warmeft vigor, not to be Ambitious 
of all we are able to attain. For 
pray wherein do the Joys of Hea- 
ven confift, but in the Fruition of 
GOD the Only and All fatisfying 
Good ? and how can we Enjoy Him 
but by Loving him ? And is it not 
the property of that Paffion to think 
it can never Enjoy enough but ftill 
to third for more? How then can 
we Love GOD if we do not Long 
and Labour for the fullest Enjoy- 
ment of him f And if u'e do not 
Love Him how are we like to En- 
joy Him in any the leaji Degree ? 
He needs neither our Services nor 
our Company, He lofes nothing of 
His Happinefs, tho we will not fit 
our felves to receive thofe Commu- 
nications of it He is defirous t'impart 
to us; and therefore we've no rea- 
fon to think He will force His Bills 

upon

upon us, render thofe Faculties He 
has given us needlefs, and make us 
Happy how unfit foever we are for 
Beatitude. What did we come into 
the World for > To Eat and to 
Drink and to purfue the little Im- 
pertinencies of this Life? Surely no, 
our Wife Creator has Nobler Ends 
whatever we have ; He fent us hi- 
ther to pais our Probation, to Pre* 
pare our felvesand be Candidates 
for Eternal Happinefs in a better. 
And how fhall this be done but by 
Labour and Induftry ? A Labour in- 
deed, but fuch as carries its Reward 
with it, befides what it is entituled 
to hereafter. 

The Truth is, that the Condition 
of our Prefent State is fuch, that 
we can't do any thing, much left 
what's Great and Excellent without 
fome Pain and Wearinefs of the 
Flefli h even our very Pleafures are 
accompanied with Pain, nor wou'd 
they relifh without it, this is the 
Sauce that recommends them. And 

why 



40 The Second Part of the 

why then fnall u e be averfe to the 
taking a little Pains in that Cafe only 
in which 'twill be worth our while? 
A Title, an Eftate, or Place, caq 
neither be got nor kept without 
fome difficulty and trouble; an 
Amour, nay even a paltry Drefs 
cant be managM without fome 
Thought and Concern, and are our 
Minds the only thing that do not 
need, or not deferve them ? Has 
pur Bountiful Lord fet no limits to 
oar Happinefs but the Capacity of 
our Nature, and (hall we fet left, 
and not ftrive to extend our Capa- 
cities to their utmoft reach ? Has 
the obliging Son of G O D thought 
no difficulties too mighty, no Pain 
too great to undergo for the Love of 
us, and (hall we be fo difingenuous 
and ungrateful as to think a few 
hours Solitude, a little Meditation 
and Watchfulnefs too much to re- 
turn to his Love? No certainly, 
we cannot have fuch narrow grovel- 
ing hearts; no we are all on Fire, 

and

and only want to know wherein to 
employ our A&ivity, and how to 
manage it to the bed: advantage, 
which if we wou'd do we muft in

all our former Prejudices, from our 
Opinion of Names, Authorities, 
Cuftoms and the like, not give cre- 
dit to any thing any longer becaufe 
we have once believ'd it, but be- 
caufe it carries clear and uncontefted 
Evidence along with it. I fhou'd 
think there needed no more to per- 
fuade us to this, than a confidera- 
tion of the mifchiefs thefe Prejudi- 
ces do us. Thefe are the grand hin- 
drance in our fearch after Truth ; 
thefe difpofe us for the reception of 
Error, and when we have imbib'd

and fhorten our views, hinder the 
free range of our Thoughts and con- 
fine them only to that particular 
track which thefe have taken ; and

in a word, ereft a Tyranny over 
our free born Souls, whilft they 
fuffer nothing to pals for True that 
has not been ftampt at their own 
Mint. But this is not all their mi£ 
chief, they are really the root of 
Scepticifm ; for when we have ta- 
ken up an Opinion on weak Grounds 
and ftifly adher'd to it, coming af- 
terwards by fome chance or other 
to be convinced of its falfeneft, the 
fame difpofition which induced us to 
receive the Premifes without Rea- 
fon, now inclines us to draw as 
falfe a Conclufion from them ; and 
becaufe we feem'd once well affurM 
of what now appears to have no- 
thing in't to make us fo, therefore 
we fancy there's nothing certain, 
that all our Notions are but Proba- 
bilities, which ftand or fall accord- 
ing to the Ingenuity of their Ma- 
nagers, and (b from an unreafonable 
Obftinacy we pafs on to as unrea- 
fbnable a Levity ; fo fmooth is the 
tranfition from believing too eafily 

and 



Propofal to the Ladies. 43 

and too much, to the belief of juft 
nothing at all. 

But pray where's the force of this 
Argument, " This is true becaufe 
" fuch a Perfon or fuch a Number 
" of Men have faid it. Or, which 
cl commonly weighs more, becaufe 
"I my felf, the dear Idol of my 
u own Heart have fometimes em- 
" brac'd and perhaps very zealoufly 
" maintained it ? Were we to Poll 
for Truth, or were our own parti- 
cular Opinions th'Infallible Standard 
of it, there were reafbn to fubfcribe 
to the Sentiments of the Many, or 
to be tenacious of our Own. But 
fince Truth tho fhe is bright and 
ready to reveal her felf to all fin- 
cere Inquirers, is not often found 
by the generality ofthofe who pre- 
tend to feek after her, Intereft, Ap* 
plaufe, or fome other little fordid 
Paffion, being really the Miftrefs 
they courr, whilft file (like Religi- 
on in another Cafe) is made ufe of-

the better ; fince we're commonly 
too much under the power of Inordi- 
nate Affe&ions to have our Under- 
standings always clear and our Judg- 
ments certain, are too rafli, too pre- 
cipitate not to need the affiftance of 
a calmer thought, a more ferious 
review* Reafbn wills that we fhou'd 
think again , and not form our 
Conclufions or fix our foot till we 
can honeftly fay, that we have with- 
out Prejudice or Prepoffefiion view'd 
the matter in Debate on all fides, 
feen it in every light, have no bias 
to encline us either way, but are 
only determin'd by Truth it felf, 
fhining brightly in our eyes, and 
not permitting us to refill the force 
and Evidence it carries. This True 
fure is what Rational Creatures 
ought to do, what's then the Reafon 
that they do't not ? 

Lazinefs and Idlenefs in the 
firft place* Thinking is a pain to 
thofe who have difus'd it, they will 
not be at the trouble of carrying

on a thought, of purfuing a Medi- 
tation till it leads them into the con- 
fines of Truth, much left till it puts 
'em in poffeflion of her. 5 Tis an 
eafier way to follow on in a beaten 
road, than to launch out into the 
main Ocean, thoit be in order to the 
making of new Difcoveries ; they 
therefore who would be thought 
knowing without taking too much 
pains to be fo, fuppofe 'tis enough to 
go on in their Fore-fathers fteps, to 
fay as they fay, and hope they fhall 
get as much Reputation by it as 
thofe who have gone before. 

Again Self-love, an excellent 
Principle when true , but the worft 
and moft mifchievous when mi- 
ftaken , diipofes us to be reten- 
tive cff our Prejudices and Errors, 
efpecially when it is joyn'd as moft 
commonly it is with Pride and Con- 
ceitednefs. The Condition of our 
prefent State (as was faid before) 
in which wc feel the force of our 
Paffions e*re wc difcern the ftrength 

of 



^6 The Second Part of the 

of our Reafon, neceffitates us to 
take up with fuch Principles and 
Reafonings to direft and determin 
thefe Paflions as we happen to meet 
with, tho probably they are far from 
being juft ones, and are fuch as Edu- 
cation or Accident not right Reafon 
difpofesus to; and being inur'd and 
habituated to thefe, we at laft take 
them for our own, for parts of our 
dear beloved felves, and are as un- 
willing to be divorced from them 
as we wou d be to part with a Hand 
or an Eye or any the moft ufeful 
Member. Whoever talks contrary 
to thefe receiv'd Notions feems to 
banter us, to perfuade us out of our 
very Senfes, and does that which 
our Pride cannot bear, he fuppofes 
we've been all along deceiv'd and 
muft begin anew : 'We therefore 
inftead of depofiting our old Errors, 
fifh about for Arguments to defend 
^m, and do not raife Hypothefes 
on the Difcoveries we have made 
of Truth, but fcarch for Probabili- 
ties

ties to maintain our Hypothecs. 
And what's the refuk of all this ? 
Having fet out in a wrong way 
we're refolv'd to perfift in it, we/^' 
papain the dark and quarrel with 
thofe who wou'd lead us out of 
it! 

But is there no Remedy for this 
dKbrder, fince we hope that All are 
not irrecoverably loft, tho too many 
are (b invellop'd in Prejudice that 
there's little probability of difenga- 
ging them ? Why really the beft 
that I can think of at pi efent is, to 
Refolve to be Induftrious, and to 
think no Pains too much to purchafe 
Truth ; to confider that our Fore- 
fathers were Men of like Paflions 
with us, and are therefore not to be 
Credited on the fcore of Authority 
but of Reafbn ; to remember like- 
wile our own Infirmity, the fliort- 
nefs of our Views, and the bias which 
our Paflions and fecular Interefts 
give us; generoufly to difengage 
our felyes from the deceptions of 

fcnfe,

fenfe, from all finifter and little De- 
figns, and hoiieftly to fearch after 
Truth for no other End but the 
Glory of GOD, by the accomplish- 
ing of our Own and our NeigMWH* 
Minds, and when we have humbly 
implor'd, as now we may very well 
hope for the Divine Affiftance, that 
the Father of Lights will fhine up- 
on us, and that He who is theWay, 
theTruth and the Life will lead us in- 
to all Truth ; why then we fhou'd do 
well to take notice, That it is of no 
great confequence to us w hat oar old 
Opinions are any farther than as we 
perfift in 'em ; that there's no ne- 
ceffity that they fhou'd be true, but 
'tis highly necelTary we fhou'd fix 
on what is fo ; therefore thefe alfb 
muft be made to pafs the Scrutiny, 
and be cafhier'd if they ftand not 
the Teft of a fevere Examination 
and found Reafbn. 

'Tis a great miftake to fancy 
it a reproach to change our Sen- 
timents, the infamy lies on their 

fide 



Propofal to the Ladies. 4P 

fide who wilfully and unreafbnably 
adhere to 'em. Not but that it is 
mean and fhameful to be ever on 
the tip-toe, and indeed to change in 
any Cafe where pure and difinterefs'd 
Reaibn does not oblige us to it. To 
be once willing to alter our fenti- 
ments if there be juft occafion for't, 
wou'd for ever after fecure us from 
Changing, to which the Precipitate 
and Obftinate are moft liable 5 where- 
as fuch as fufpend their Judgments 
till after a fufficient Examination and 
Weighing of all things they fee caule 
to fix them, do feldom Change, be- 
caufe they can hardly meet with 
any Reaibn to do fo ; and indeed 
whatever may be the Character of a 
Wit, Stay'dnefs and Deliberation is 
that of a Wife Perfon. 

But as there is an extream on one 
hand in being too refolutely bent on 
our Old Opinions, fo is there on the 
other in inordinately thirfting after 
Novelty. An Opinion is neither 
better nor worfe for being Old or 
D New, 



5 o The Second Part of the 

New, the Truth of it is the only 
rthing confiderable; tho properly 
peaking all Truth is Ancient, as be- 
ing from Eternity in the Divine Ide- 
as, 'tis only New in refpeft of our 
Difcoveries. If we go about to ai- 
iign a Reafon for this inlatiable 
deiire of Novelty, I know not how 
to find a better than our Credulity 
and eafy aiTent to things inevident. 
Truth being the proper Objed of the 
Underflanding it does naturally 
fearch after it, and tho this fearch 
will never wholly ceafe, becaufe 
our Under/landings are more capa- 
cious than our Discoveries, and the 
view of one Truth is but a Prepa- 
rative to look farther , yet had we 
clear and certain Evidence for our 
Conclufions, tho that wouM net end 
our Inquiries, it wou'd however fa- 
tisfie us, fo far at leaft as they had 
gone. Whereas on the contrary your 
hunters after Novelty are commonly 
never fatisfied, they pull down to 
day what they had built up yefter-

day, and Why? But becaufe they 
concluded too Toon ? and their Novel 
Hypothefis is founded on Fancy or 
PaGion, or any thing rather than 
Right Reafbn. • 

But when I fpeak of the little de- 
ference that is to be given to Names, 
Authorities, andreceiv'd Opinions, 
I extend it no farther than to mat- 
ters purely Philofophical to mere 
Humane Truths and do not defign 
any Prejudice to the Authority of 
the Church which is of different 
confideration. For tho it be neceC- 
fary even in this Cafe, to depose 
whatever may look like a Prejudice, 
ariftng from that particular way of 
Worfhip, whereby that Communi- 
on in which we've been Educated is 
diftinguifh'd from all other Chrifti- 
ans,yetasto the Subftantials of Faith 
and Pra&ice, tho every one be al- 
lowed to Examine, for they will 
bear the Teft, yet it is not fit that he 
ihouM draw Conclusions, contrary 
to what has been already determined 
D 2 by 



5 2 The Second Part of the 

by the Catholic^ Church, or even 
by that particular Church of which 
he is a Member, unlefs where itdoes 
plainly and evidently contradifl: that 
fenfe of Holy Scripture which has 
been receiv'd by the Church Uni- 
verfal. Nor is this a giving up our 
felves to Authority barely as fuch, 
'tis only a modeft deference to Truth. 
Philofophical Truths are not open to 
every Inquirer, an elevated Genius 
and great application of Mind is re- 
quir'd to find them out, nor are they 
of that importance but that Men 
may give Scope to their Thoughts, 
and very often think, tho indeed un- 
reafonably, that they're oblig'd in 
point of Honour to defend their own 
Hypothecs. But the Articles of 
our Faith and the great Principles of 
Chrifiian Morality are of another 
Nature, GOD wotfd have all Men 
to be fav^d and to come to the Kjiow- 
lege of thefe Truths^ tho he did not 
defign em all for Philofophers, and 
therefore they carry a Proof and Evi-

dence fuited to the very Vulgar,which 
he who runs may read, which every 
one ought to acquiefce in, tho accord- 
ing to their leifure and capacity 'tis 
fit they inquire why. And being 
a matter of the higheft concern fuch 
as our Eternal Happineft or Mifery 
depends on, it may reafonably be 
fuppofs'd (tho to the fhame of our 
Folly we fometimes find the contra- 
ry^ that Men won't play faft and 
loofe in a Bufinefs of fo vafl impor- 
tance, but that all Chriftians have 
as they ar6 obiig'd ferioufly and ful- 
ly con fider'd it, and efpecially thoie 
who are more peculiarly fet apart by 
the Divine Appointment for the 
ftudy of Sacred Truths. So that to 
acquiefce in the Authority of the 
Church, fo far as it is here plead- 
ed for is no more than this, The call- 
ing in to our affiftance the Judg- 
ment and Advice of thofe whom 
GOD hath fet over us, and confc- 
quently whom he affifts in a more 
efpecial manner, to difcharge that

them ; and, in fuch difputable points 
as we're not able to determine for 
our felves, a quiet fubmiflion to the 
Voice of our Guides, whom Mo- 
dc(\y will incline us to think have 
greater Abilities and AiTiftances, as 
well as more Time and Opportunity 
to find out the Truth than we. 

As Prejudice fetters the Under- 
standing To does Cuftom manacle 
the Will, v, hich fcarce knows how 
to divert from a Track which the 
generality around it take, and to 
which it has it felfbeen habituated. 
It wou'd be too large adigreffion, to 
cxamin throughly a Subjeft ib fit 
to be confider'd, being it is the root 
of very much Evil, the laft refuge 
of Vice where it fortifies it felf 
when driven from all other retreats. 
We fliall therefore forbear to enquire 
from what raiftakes it draws its 
force, what Confederations are pro- 
per to difarm it of its power, and 
what elfe' might be of ufe to

deliver us from its Slavery, and on- 
ly remark ; That tho great defe- 
rence is to be paid to the Ways and 
Ufages of the Wife and Good, yet 
considering that thefe are the leaft 
number of Mankind, 'tis the Croud 
who will make the Mode, and con- 
fequently it will be as abfurd as 
they are: The:efore Guftooi an^ 
not Authoriie a Practice if Ilea- 
fbn Condemns it, the following a 
Multitude is no excufe for the doing 
of Evil. None but the Weak and 
Inconfiderable flvitn down with the 
Torrent, brave Spirits delight to 
ftem the Tide, they know no Con- 
queft fo Glorious, becaufe none fo

over foolifh and ill-grounded Max- 
ims and finful Cuftoms ; What 
wdu'd they not do to reftore Man- 
kind to their Lawful Liberty, and 
to pull down this wcrft of Tyran-

And as we difregard the Cenfures

to the making that eafie and pleafant

to lay down what feems to me the

Whoever wou'd Aft to purpofe

thro out their whole progrefs. Life 
without this is a difproportionateun- 
feemly thing, a confuted huddle of 
broken, contradictory Adtions, fuch 
as afford us nothing but the being a- 
fham'd of 'em. But do we need 
to be taught our End? One wou'd 
rather think there were no occafion 
to mention it, did not Experience 
daily convince us how many there 
are who neglect it. What End can 
Creatures have but their Creators 
Glory ? And did they truly under- 
ftand their own Happinefs 'tis cer-

this is the only way of procuring 
their own Felicity. But it is not 
enough to have barely an implicit 
and languid defireof it, 'twere much 
better to hold it ever in view, and 
that all'our Adtions had in their pro- 
portion a warm and immediate ten- 
dency thither. This wou'd ftamp 
the impreffion of Holinefi upon the 
mod indifferent Aflion, and without 
this what is Materially and to all out- 
ward appearance very good, is real- 
ly and truly no better than a fpeci- 
ous tolly. We are not made for our 
felves, nor was it ever defign'd' we. 
fhou'd be ador'd and idolized by one 
another. Our Faculties were given 
us for Ufe not Oftentation, not to 
make a noife in the World, but -to- 
be (erviceable in it, to declare the 
VVifdom, Power and Goodnefs, of 
that All-Pcrfed Being from whom 
we derive All our Excellencies , 
and in whofe Service ihey ought 
Wholly to be employed. Did our. 
Knowlege ferve no other purpofe 

than

than the exalting us in our own Opi- 
nion, or in that of our Fellow Crea- 
tures, the furnifhing us with Mate- 
rials for a quaint D.lcourle, an agree- 
able Converfation, 'twere fcarce 
worth while to be at the trouble of 
attaining it. But when it enlarges 
the Capacity of our Minds, gives us 
nobler Ideas of the Majefty, the 
Grandeur and Glorious Attributes of 
our adorable Creator, Regulates 
our Wills and makes us more capa- 
ble of Imitating and Enjoying him, 
'tis then a truly fublime thing, a 
worthy Objefl: of our Induftry: And 
fhe who does not make this the End 
of her Study, fpends her Time and 
Pains to no purpofe or to an ill 
one. 

We have no better way of finding 
out the true End of any thing, than 
by obferving to what Ufe it is mod 
adapted. Now the Art or WelULiv-

to me the moft exalted, which has 
the Cleareft and moft Extenfive 
view of fuch Truths as are fuitable 
to its Capacity, and Necefiary or 
Convenient to be Known in this 
Prefent State. For being that we 
are but Creatures, our Undemand-

ly a limited excellency. It has in- 
deed a vaft extent, and it were not 
amifs if we tarried a little in the 
Contemplation of its Powers and 
Capacities, provided that the Prof- 
peft did not make us giddy, that 
we remember from whom we have 
receiv'd them , and ballance thofe 
lofty Thoughts which a view of 
our Intelle&uals may occafion, with 
the depreffing ones which the irre- 
gularity of our Morals will fuggeft, 
and that we learn from this infpe&i- 
on, how indecorous it is to bufy this 
bright fide of us in mean things, 

feeing

feeing it is capable of fuch noble 
ones. 

Human Nature is indeed a won- 
derful Compofure admirable in its 
outward ftru&ure, but much more 
excellent in the Beauties of its In- 
ward, and fhe who confiders in 
whofe Image her Soul was Created, 
and whofe Blood was filed to Re- 
deem it, cannot prize it too much, 
nor forget to pay it her utmoft re- 
gard. There's nothing in this Ma- 
terial World to be compared to't, all 
the gay things we dote on, and for 
which we many times expofe our 
Souls to ruin, are of no confiderati- 
on in refpeft of it. They are not 
the good of the Soul, it's happinefs 
depends not on em, but they often 
deceive and withdraw it from its 
true Good. It was made for the 
Contemplation and Enjoyment of 
its GOD, and all Souls are capa- 
ble of this tho in a different degree 
and by meafures fo.newhat different, 
as we hope will appear from that 
which follows. £. I. Truth 



Prcpofal to the Ladies. 7 1 

£. I. Truth in general is the Ob- 
ject of the Underitanding, but all 
Truths are not equally Evident, be- 
caufe of the Limitation of the Hu- 
mane Mind, which tho' it can gra- 
dually take in many Truths , yet 
cannot any more than our fight at- 
tend to many things at once: And 
likewife, becaule GOD has not 
thought fit to communicate fuch 
Ideas to us, asareneceiTary to the diP 
quifirion of fome particular Truths. 
For knowing nothing without us 
but by the Idea we have of it, and 
Judging only according to the Rela- 
tion we find between two or more 
Ideas, when we cannot difcover the 
Truth wefearch after by Intuition 
or the immediate comparifon of two 
Ideas, 'tis neceffary that we fhou'd 
have a third by which to compare 
them. But if this middle Idea be 
wanting, though we have fufficient 
Evidence of thofe two which we 
wou'd coippare, becaufe we have a 

Clear 



72 The Second V art of the 

Clear and Diftintt Conception of 
them, yet we are Ignorant of thofe 
Truths which wcu'd arife from their 
Comparifon , becaufe we want a 
third by which to compare them. ' 

To give an inftance of this in a 
point of great confequence, and of 
late very much controverted tho to 
little purpofe, becaufe we take a 
wrong method, and wou'd make 
that the Objeft of Science which is 
properly the Objefl: of Faith, the 
Do&rin of the Trinity. Revelation 
which is but an exaltation and im- 
provement of Realbn has told us, 
That the Father is G O D, the Son 
is G O D, and the Holy Ghoft is 
GOD, and our Idea of the God- 
head of any one of thefe Peribns, is 
as clear as our Idea of any of the 
other. Both Reafon and Revelation 
allure us that G O D is One Simple 
EiTence, Undivided, and Infinite in 
all PerfecHon,this is the Natural Idea 
which we have of G OD. How 
then can the Father be G D , the 

Son 



Propofal to the Ladies. 73 

Son GOD, and the Holy Ghoft 
GOD, when yet there is but One 
GOD. ? That thefe two Propofiti- 
ons are true we are certain, both be- 
caufe GOD who cannot lie hasRe- 
veaPd 'em, and becaufe we have as 
clear an Idea of 'em as it is poffible a 
Finite Mind fhou'd have of an Infi- 
nite Nature. But we cannot find 
out how this fhould be, by the bare 
Comparifon of thefe two Ideas with- 
out the. help of a third by which to 
compare them. This GOD has not 
thought fit to impart to u«, the Prof- 
peft it wou'd have given us wou'd 
have been too dazling, too bright 
for Mortality to bear, and we ought 
to acquiefce in the Divine Will. So 
then, we are well affur'd thax thefe 
two Propofitions are true, There is 
but one UOD ; And, There are three 
Perfons in the Godhead : but we know 
not the Manner how thefe things are. 
Nor can our acquiescence bethought 
Unreafonable, nor the Do&rin we 
fubfcribe to be run down as abfurd

and contradictory by every little 
warm Difputer and Pretender to 
Reafbn, whofe Life is perhaps a con- 
tinual contradi&ion to it, and he 
knows little of it befides the Name. 
For we ought not to think it ftrange 
that GOD has folded up his own 
Nature, not in Darknefs, but in an 
adorable and inacceflible Light,fince 
his Wildom fees it fit to keep us ig- 
norant of our own. We know and 
feel the Union between our Soul and 
Body but who amongft us fees fo 
clearly, as to find out with Certitude 
and Exa&neis, the fecret ties which 
unite two fuch different Subftances, 
or how they are able to a& upon 
each other ? We are confeious of our 
own Liberty, who ever denies it de- 
nies that he is capable of Rewards 
and Punifhments, degrades his Na- 
ture and makes himfeif but a more 
curious piece of Mechanifm ; and 
none but Atheifts will call in quefti- 
on the Providence of GOD, or de- 
ny that he Governs ^li> even the 

moft 



Propofal to the Ladies, 7 5 

moft Free of all his Creatures. But 
who can reconcile me thefc? Or ad- 
juft the limits between GOD's Pre- 
ference and Mans Free-will? Our 
Underftandings are fufficiently illu- 
minated to lead us to the Fountain of* 
Life and Light, we do or may know 
enough to fill our Souls with the no- 
bleft Conceptions,the humbleft Ado- 
ration, and the intireft Love of the 
Author of our Being, and what can 
we defire farther ? If we make Co ill 
a Uie of that Knowledge which we 
have, as to be fo far puffed up with 
it, as to turn it againft him who 
gave it, how dangerous would it be 
for us to have more Knowledge, in 
a State in which we have fo little 
Humility! But if vain Man will 
pretend to Wifdom, let him firft 
learn to know the length of his own 
line. 

Tho the Human Intelle£t has a 

large extent, yet being limited as we 

have already faid, this Limitation is 

the Caufe ofthofe different Modes of 

E 2 Think- 



7 6 The Second Part of the 

Thinking, which for diftin&ion 
fake we call Faith, Science and O- 
pinion. For in this prefent and im- 
perfect State in which we know not 
any thing by Intuition, or imrnedi- 
View, except a few firft Principles 
which we call Self-evident, themoft 
of our Knowlege is acquir'd by Rea- 
foning and Dedu&ion: And thefe 
three Modes of Underftanding,Faith, 
Science and Opinion are no other- 
wife diftinguith'd, than by the dif- 
ferent degrees of Clearnefs and Evi- 
dence in the Premifes from whence 
the Conclufion is drawn. 

Knowlege in a proper and re- 
ftri&ed Senfe and as appropriated 
to Science, fignifies that clear Percep- 
tion which is follow'd by a firm a£ 
fent to Conclufions rightly drawn 
from Premifes of which we have 
clear and diftinft Ideas. Which Pre- 
mifes or Principles muft be fo clear 
and Evident, that fuppofing us rea- 
fonable Creatures, and free from 
Prejudices and Paflions, (which for 

the 



Propofal to the Ladies. 7 7 

the time they predominate as good 
as deprive us of our Reafon) we 
cannot withhold our aflent from 
them without manifeft violence to 
our Reafon. 

But if the Nature of the thing be 
fuch as that it admits of no undoubt- 
ed Premifes to argue from, or at lea (t 
we don't at prefent know of any, or 
that the Conclufion dpcs not fo ,ne- 
celTarily follow as to give a perfeQ; 
fatisfaftion to the Mind and to free 
it from all hefitation, that which we 
think of it is then call'd Opinion. 

Again, If the Medium we make 
ufe of to prove the Propofition be 
Authority, the Conclufion which 
we draw from it is faid to be Be- 
liev'd ; This is what we call Faith, 
and when the Authority is GOD's a 
Divine Faith. 

Moral Certainty is a Species of 
Knowlege whole Proofs are of a 
compounded Nature, in part refemb- 
ling thofe which belong to Science, 
and partly thofe of Faith. We do not 
E 3 make 



7 8 The Second Part of the 

the whole Procefs our felves, but de- 
pend on another for the immediate 
Proof, but we our felves deduce the 
AJediate fromCircumftances andPrin- 
ciplesas Certain and almoft as Evi- 
dent as thofe of Science, and which 
lead -us to the immediate Proofs and 
make it unreafonable to doubt of em. 
Indeed we not feldom deceive our 
felves in this matter, by inclining al- 
ternately to btfth extremes, Some- 
times we rejeft Truths which areMo- 
rally Certain asConje&ural and Pro- 
bable only, becaufe they have not a 
Phyfical and Mathematical Cer- 
tainty, which they are incapable 
of. At another time we embrace the 
flighted Conje&ures and any thing 
that looks with Probability, as mo- 
ral Certainties and real Verities, if 
Fancy, Paflion or Intereft recom- 
mend them} fo ready are we to be 
determin'd by theft rather than by 
fblid Reafon. 

In this enumeration of the feveral 
ways of Knowing. I have not reck- 
oned 



Propofal to the Ladies. J J 

on d the Senfes, in regard that we're 
more properly faid to be Confcious of 
than to Kpow fuch things as we per- 
ceive by Senfation. And alfb be- 
caufe that Light which we fuppofe 
to be let into our Ideas by our Sen- 
fes is indeed very dim and fallacious, 
and not to be relied on till it has paft 
the Teft of Reafon ; neither do I 
think there's any Mode of Know- 
lege which mayn't bereduc'd to thofe 
already mentioned. 

Now tho there's a great difference 
between Opinion and Science, true 
Science being immutable but Opini- 
on variable and uncertain,yet there is 
not fuch a difference between Faith 
and Science as is ufually- fuppos'd. 
The difference confifts not in the 
Certainty but in the way of Proof; 
the Obje&s of Faith are as Rationally 
and as Firmly Prov'd as the Objefts. 
of Science, tho by another way. As 
Science Demonftrates things that are 
Seen, fo Faith is the Evidence of fuch 
as are Not Seen, And he who rejefls 
E 4 the 



80 The Second Part of the 

the Evidence of Faith in fuch things 
as belong to its Cognizance, is as un- 
reafbnable as he who denies Propo- 
fitions in Geometry that are prov'd 
with Mathematical exa&nefs. 

There's nothing true which is not 
in it felfdemonftrabie, or which we 
fhould not pronounce to be true had 
we a Clear and Intuitive View of 
it. But as was faid above we fee 
very few things by Intuition, nei- 
ther are we furnifh'd with Mediums 
to make the Procefs our fdvesin De- 
monftrating all Truths, and there- 
fore there are fbme Truths which 
we muft either be totally ignorant 
of, or elfe receive them on the Tefti- 
mony of another Perfon, to whoft 
Underftanding they are clear and 
manifeft tho not to ours. And if this 
Perfon be one who can neither be 
Deceiv'd nor Deceive, we're as cer- 
tain of thofe Conclufions which we 
prove by his Authority, as we're of 
thofe we demonftrate by our own 
Reafon; nay more Certain, by how 

much 



Propofal to the Ladies. 81 

much his Reafon is more Compre- 
henfive and Infallible than our 
own. 

Science is the following the Procefs 
our Selves upon Clear and Evident 
Principles ; Faith is a Depsndance 
on the Credit of another, infuch 
matters as are out of our View. And 
when we have very good Reafon to. 
fiibmit to the Teftimony of the Per- 
fon we Believe, Faith is as Firm, and 
thofe Truths it difcovers to us as tru- 
ly Intelligible, and as ftronglyProv'd 
in their kind as Science. 

In a word, as every Senfefb every 
Capacity of the Underftanding has 
its proper Obje£L The Objects of 
Science are things within our 
View, of which we may have Clear 
and Diftin£t Ideas , and nothing 
fhou'd be determin'd here without 
Clearnefs and Evidence, Tobea- 
ble to repeat any Perfbns Dogma 
without forming a Diftinft Idea of 
it our felves, is not to Know but to 
Remember; and to have a. Confute 
E 5 Inde- 



82 The Second Van of the 

Indeterminate Idea is to Conjecture 
not to Underftand. 

The Obje&s of Faith are as Cer- 
tain and as truly Intelligible in them- 
felves as thofe of Science, as has been 
faid already, only we becomeperfua- 
ded of the Truth of them by another 
Method, we do not See tbem fo 
clearly and diftin£tly as to be una- 
able to disbelieve them. Faith has 
a mixture of the Will that it may be 
rewardable, for who will thank us 
for giving our Aflent where it was 
impoffible to withold it> Faith then 
may be faid to be a fort of Know- 
lege capable of Reward, and Men 
are Infidels not for want of Con- 
vittion, but thro an Vrwillingntfs 
to Believe. 

But as it is a fault to Believe in 
matters of Science, where we may 
expsQ; Demonftration and Evidence, 
fb it is a reproach to our Under- 
ftanding and a proof of our Difinge- 
cuity, to require that fort of Pro- 
cefs peculiar to Science, for the Con-

the proper Objects of it. It is. as ridi- 
culous as to rejed Mufick,becau(e we 
cannot Taft or Smell it, or to deny 
there is fuch a thing as Beauty be-

a moderate Genius, I fuppofe will

allotting to each Senfe its proper em-

readily acknowlege that it is as Ho-

is truly the ObjeQ: of Faith, as it is

Object of her Kno wlege. And were

fbpher in Phyfical Truths, the Prin- 
ciples of which we have as much 
right to examine, and to make de-

Tofumupall: We may know 
enough for all the purpofes of Life, 
enough to bufie this aftive Faculty 
of Thinking, to employ and enter- 
tain the fpare Intervals of Time and 
to keep us from Ruft and Idlenefs,

reckon that we know very little if 
we go about to make our Own Rea- 
fon the Standard of all Truth. It 
is very certain that nothing is True 
but what is conformable to Reafon, 
that is to the Divine Reafon of which 
ours is but a fhort faint Ray, and it 
is as certain that there are many 
Truths which Human Reafon can- 
not Comprehend. Therefore to be 
throughly fenfible of the Capacity 
of the Mind, to difcern precifely its 
Bounds and Limits and to direft our 
Studies and Inquiries accordingly, 
to Know what is to be Known, and 
to Believe what is to be Believ'd is 
the property of a Wife Per fon. To 
be content with too little Knowlege, 
or to afpire to over- much is equal- 
ly a fault, to make that ufe of our 
Under ftandings which GOD has 
Fitted and Defign'd them for is 
the Medium which we ought to 
take. For the difference between 
a Plow- man and a Do&or does not 
feem to me to confiit in this , That 

the 



8 6 The Second. Part of the 

the Bufinefi of the one is to fearch 
after Knowlege, and that the other 
has nothing to do with it. No, who- 
ever has a Rational Soul ought fure- 
ly to" employ it about fome Truth 
or other ,to procure for it right Ideas, 
that its Judgments may be true tho 
its Knowlege be not very extenfive. 
But herein lies the difference, that 
tho Truth is the Objeft of every In- 
dividual Underftanding , yet all 
are not equally enlarged nor able to 
comprehend ib much ; and they 
whole Capacities and Circumftances 
of Living do not fit 'em for it, lie 
not under that obligation of extend- 
ing their view which Perfons of a 
larger reach and greater leifure do. 
There is indeed often times a mit 
take in this matter, People who are 
not fit will be puzling their heads to 
little purpofe, and thofe who are 
prove Slothful and decline the trou- 
ble ; and thus it will be if we do not 
throughly underftand our felves, but 
fuffer Pride or Eafe to make the efti- 
mate. ^. II. It

$. II. It is therefore very fit that 
after we have confider'd the Capa- 
city of the Underftanding in gene- 
ral, we fhou'd defcend to the view 
of our own particular, obferving 
the bent and turn of our own Minds, 
which way our Genius lies and to 
what it is moft inclin'd. I fee no rea- 
fon why there may not be as great 
a variety in Minds as there is in Fa- 
ces, that the Soul as well as the Bo- 
may not have fomething in it to di- 
ftinguifhit, not only from all other 
Intelligent Natures but even from 
thofe of its own kind. There are 
different proportions in Faces which 
recommend them to fbme Eyes (bon- 
er than to others, and tho All Truth 
is amiable to a Reafonable Mind, 
and proper to employ it, yet why 
may there not be fome particular 
Truths, more agreeable to each in- 
dividual Underftanding than others 
are ? Variety gives Beauty to the 
Material World and why not to the 

Intel- 



8 § The Second Part of the 

Intellectual? We can difcern the 
different Abilities which the Wife 
Author of all things has endow'd us 
with, the different Circumftances 
in which he has placd us in refer- 
ence to this World and the Concerns 
of an Animal Life, thatfo we may 
be mutually ufeful, and that fince 
each fingle Perfon is too limited and 
confin'd to attend to many, much 
lefs to all things, we may receive 
from each other a reciprocal advan- 
tage, and why may we not think he 
has done the like in refpeft of Truth ? 
that fince it is too much for one, our 
united Strength fhou'd be employ'd 
in thefearch of her. Efpecially fince 
the Divine Being who contains in 
himfelf all Reality and Truth is In- 
finite in Perfection, and therefore 
fhou d be Infinitely Ador'd and 
Lov'd s and If Creatures are by their 
being fo uncapable of rendering to 
their Incomprehenfible Creator an 
Adoration and Love that's worthy 
of him, it is but decorous that they 

fhou'd 



Trofofal to tJje Ladies. 8 ^ 

fhoud however do as much as they 
can. All that variety of fublime 
Truths of Beautiful and Wondrous 
Objefts which furround us, are no- 
thing elfe but a various difplay of 
his unbounded Excellencies, and 
why fhou'd any of 'em pafs unob- 
ferv'd? Why fhou'd not every indi- 
vidual Understanding be in a more 
efpecial manner fitted for and era- 
ploy'd in the difquifition of fome 
particular Truth and Beauty ? Tis 
true after all our rcfearches we can 
no more fufficiently Know GOD 
than we can worthily Love him, 
and are as much unable to find out 
all his Works as we are his Na- 
ture, yet this fhou'd only prompt 
us to exert All our Powers and to 
do our beft, fince even that were 
too little cou'd we poffibly do more. 
We can never offer to him fb much 
Praileas hedeferves, and therefore 
it is but fit that he fhou'd have All 
that Mankind can poffibly render 
him. He is indeed immutable in his 

own 



90 The Second Part of the 

own Nature, but thofe difcoveries 
we daily make of his Operations 
will always afford us fbmewhat 
New and Surprizing, for this All- 
glorious Sun the Author of Life and 
Light is as inexhauftible a Source 
of Truth as he is of Joy and Happi- 
nefs. 

If then we are convinc'd that 
there's fome peculiar Task allotted 
us, our next bufinefs will be to en- 
quire what it is. To know our own 
Strength and neither to over nor 
underrate our felves is one of the 
moft material points of Wifdom, 
and which indeed we are moft com- 
monly ignorant of, elfe we fhou'd 
not reach at all, how unable foever 
we are to attain it, nor make fb ma- 
ny fuccefslefs attempts and beforc'd 
to comeoffwith that pitiful Apology, 
Iwas mijlaken^ I did not think it, But 
we can fcarce duly eftimate our Un- 
derftandings till we have regulated 
our Wills, reformed Self-love and a 
train of immortified Paflions, which

it is not our Eufinefs to fpeak of 
here, we fhall have occafion to do't 
hereafter. Let it fuffice that we re- 
mark a frequent Error which thefe 
engage us in, that is, an aptnefs to 
leflen the Human Mind, to detraft 
from its Grandeur and abridg its 
Powers when we confider it in Ge- 
neral, and as great a forward nefs 
when we look on our felves to ex- 
tend our Abilities beyond their 
bounds. Are we confcious of a 
Defeft ? the fhallownefs of Human 
Reafon at large muftbear the blame, 
we Harangue very excellently on 
the Ignorance and Vanity of Maa-* 
kind, and it were well if we refted 
there, and wou'd forbear to murmur 
even at our Creator himfelf for al- 
lowing us fo fcanty a Portion. But 
if Reafon has fhon out, difpelling 
thofe Clouds which Eclips'd the 
bright face of Truth, we arrogate 
all to our felves. My Difcovery, 
My Hypothefis, the Strength and 
Clearnefs of My Reafonings, rather 

than 



9 2 The Second, Part of the 

than the Truth are what we wou'd 
expofe to view ; 'tis that we Idolize 
our felves and wou'd have every one 
Admire and Celebrate. And yet all 
this is no more perhaps than another 
has done before us, or at leaft 
might have done with our Opportu- 
nities and Advantages. The reverie 
of this procedure wou'd become us 
better, and it were more Glorious 
as well as more Juft to afcribe the 
Excellencies of the Mind to Human 
Nature in the Lump and to take the 
Weaknefles to our felves. By this 
we fhou'd both avoid Sloth, (the 
<fceft ufe we can make of our Igno- 
rance and Infirmity being firft to be 
humbled for, and then feduloufly to 
endeavour their Amendment^ and 
likewife fecure our Induftry from 
_the Mixtures of Pride and Envy. 
By looking on our own Acquifitions 
as a general Treafure, in which 
the Whole have a Right, we fhou'd 
pretend to no more than a fhare ; 
and confidering our felves as Parts 

of

of the fame Whole, we fhould ex- 
pe£l to find our own account in th' 
Improvement of every part of it, 
which wou'd reftrain us from being 
pufc up with the Contemplation of 
our Own, and from repining at our 
Neighbours Excellencies. For let 
Reaibn fhine forth where it may, as 
we can't engrofs, fo neither can we 
be excluded from (baring in the Be- 
nefit, unlefs we wilfully exclude our 
felves; every one being the better 
for True Worth and CJood Senfe,

of

of the former, to do us an ill-turn 
the more effectually. For it is not 
feldom feen that fuch as pretend 
great Concern for us, will prefs us 
on to fuch Studies or Ways of Liv- 
ing as inwardly they know we are 
unfit for, thereby to gratify their 
Secret Envy, by diverting us from 
that to which our Genius difpofes, 
and in which therefore they have 
reafbn to fuppofe we wou'd be Ex- 
cellent. But tho we may make ufe 
of the Opinions of both, yet if we 
will be Sincere and Ingenuous we 
cannot have a more faithful Direftor 
than our own heart. He who gave 
us thefe Difpofitions will excite us 
to the Ufe and Improvement oPem; 
and unlels we drive him from us by 
our Impurity ,or thro negligence and 
want of Attention let flip his fecret 
Whifpers, this Mafter within us 
will lay moft in our view fuch Lef- 
fons as he wou'd have us take. Our 
care then muft be to open our Eyes

to examine accurately thofe. notices

It mgy be our Humor won't be gra-

to fee farther than their Neighbours, 
to re&ifie what Cuftom has efta- 
blifh'd, and are fb Unmannerly as 
to Think and Talk out of the Com- 
mon way. He who (peaks Truth 
makes a Satyr on the greateft part of

Gall is touch'd proportionably as 
their Wounds are more deeply 
fearch'd into, altho it be only in or- 
der to a Cure. They therefore who 
Love Truth {hall be Hated by the 
Moft, who tho they openly pretend 
to Honour, yet fecretly Malign her, 
becaufe (he reproaches them. And 
as a plaufible Life is not often a very 
Religious one, which made the beft 
Judge pronounce a Wo on thofe 
whom all Men (ball fpeak well of, 
fo neither is the moft Juft and Illu-

Speaker, as well as a plaufible Liv-

If then we confult our Paflions and

Nature has fitted us for. Hence it 
is that thofe who might have done 
very well in fome Studies and Em- 
ployments, make but bungling work 
when they apply themfetves to o- 
thers. We go on apace when the 
Wind and Tide are on our fide, but 
it cofts us much Labour, and we 
make little fpeed, when we Row a- 
gainft both. 

And as a due Confideration of 
our Particular Capacity woud put 
us right in our own Studies, fbwou'd 
it keep us from clafhing with our 
Neighbours, whom we many times 
Contend with not fo much out of a 
Love to Truth, as thro a humor of 
Contradiction, or becaufe we think 
this the bed way to fhew our Parts, 
and by this tryal of Skill to exalt our 
felves above them. But is there no 
better way to difcover our Penetra-

by a Malicious and Litigious Oppo-

low Travellers, of bending all the 
force of our Wit to Contradict and 
Oppofe thofe advances which they 
make, we wou'd well underftand, 
duly Employ and kindly Communi-

more Service might we do our Lord, 
how much more ufefui might we be

§. III. We have already expreft 
our thoughts concerning the- Capa- 
city and Perfeftion of the Under- 
Handing, and what has been faid it 
duly confider'd, isfufficient to bring 
every particular Perfon acquainted 
with their own defe&s. But becaufe 
they who need Amendment mod, 
are commonly leaft difpos'd to make 
fuch reflections as are nefceffary to 
procure it, we will fpend a few Pa- 
ges in confidering for them, and in 
obferving the moft ufual defeats of 
the Thinking Faculty. 

If we are of their Opinion who 
fay that the Underftanding is only 
PajfTive, and that Judgment belongs 
to the Will, I fee not any Defeft the 
former can have, befides Narrow- 
nefs and a difability to extend it

incident to all Creatures, the bright-

plained cf, fince 'tis Natural and Ne- 
ceflary, we may as well defire to be 
•Gods as defire to Know all things. 
Some fort of Ignorance therefore, or 
Non perception we cannot help; a 
Finite Mind, fuppofe it as large as 
you pleafe, can never extend it felf 
to Infinite Truths. But no doubt it 
is in our Power to remedy a great 
deal moE§_than W e d , and proba- 
bly a largerRangeisallowedusthan 
the moft A&ive and Enlightned Un- 
tterftanding has hitherto reach'd. Ig- 
norance then can't be avoided but 
Error may, we cannot Judge of 
things of which we have no Idea, 
tut we can fufpend our Judgment 
a-bout thofe of which we have, till 
clearnefs and evidence oblige us to 
pais it. Indeed in ftridnefs of 
Speech the Will and not the Under- 
ftanding is blameable when we 
Think amifs, fince the latter oppofes 
not the Ends for which GOD made 
it, but readily extends it felf as far as

are made on it ; 'tis the former that 
direfts it to fuch Objefts, that fills 
up its Capacity with fuch Ideas as 
are foreign to its Bufinefs and of no 
ufe to it, or which does not at lead 
oppofe the incurfions of Material 
things, and deface as much as it is 
able thofeimpreffions which SenfiWe 
Obje&s leave in the Imagination. 
But fince it is not material to the pre- 
fent Defign, whether Judgment be- 
longs to the Underftanding or Will-, 
we fhall not nicely diftinguifh how 
each of em is employ *d in acquir- 
ing Knowledge, but treat of 'em both 
together in this Chapter, allotted to 
the Service of the Studious, who 
when they are put in the way may 
by their own Meditations and Expe- 
rience, re&ifie the miftakes and fup- 
ply the OmiCTions we happen to be 
guilty of. 

They who apply themfelves to the 

Contemplation of Truth,will perhaps

refpondent Ideas to be com par'd with 
it, is as it were afleep or in a Dream, 
and tho' not empty of all Thought, 
yet Thinks nothing clearly or to the 
purpo'e. The Primary Caufeofthis 
is that Limitation which all Created 
Minds are Subjefl to, which Limi- 
tation appears more vifible in fame 
than in others, either becaufe fome 
Minds are endow'd by their Creator 
with a larger Capacity than the reft, 
or if jou are not incliri'd to think fo,

the Bodily Organs, which cramps 
and comra£h the Operations of the

whofe Ideas are difbrder'd, and not 
capable of being fo difpos'd as' that 
they may be compar'd in order to

do fome Good in an A&ive Li f e and 
Employments that depend on the Bo- 
dy, but we're altogether unfit for 
Contemplation and the Exercifes of 
the Mind. Yet e'er we give out 
let's fee if it be thus with us in all 
Cafes : Can we Think and Argue 
Rationally about a Drefi, an Intrea- 
gue, an Ertate? Why then not up- 
on berter Subjects ? The way of 
Confideringand Meditating juftly is 
the fame on all Occafions. 7 Fis true, 
there will feweft Ideas arife when 
we woud Meditate on Rich Subjects 
asweVebeen le^ftconverfant about; 
but this is a fault which it is in our 
power to remedy, firft by Reading 
or Difcourfing, and then by frequent 
and ferious Meditation, of which

Volatileuefs of Thought, very per- 
nicious to true Science, is a fault 
which People of warm Imaginati- 
ons and Aftive Spirits are apt to fall 
into. Such a Temper is readily dit 
pos'd to receive Errors and very well 
qualified to propagate them, efpeci- 
aliy if avolubility of Speech be join'd 
to it. Thefe thro an immoderate 
nimblenefs of Thinking skip from 
one Idea to another, without obfer- 
ving due Order and Connexion, they 
content themfelves with a fuperficial 
view, a random glance, and depend- 
ing on the vigor v of their Imagina- 
tion, are took with Appearances,

tains all comers how impertinent fcr

Moon and building Airy Caftles 
there. Nor is it eafie to cure this 
Defe&, fince it deceives others as 
well as thofe who have it with a 
fhe w of very great Ingenuity. The 
vivacity of fuch Perfons makes their 
Converfation plaufible, and taking 
with thofe who confider not much, 
tho not with the Judicious; it pro- 
cures for them the Charafter of Wit, 
but hinders them from being Wife. 
For truth is not often found by fuch 
as won't take Time to examine her 
Counterfeits, to diftingmfti between 
Evidence and Probability, Realities. 
and Appearances, but who thro a 
conceit of their own fharp-fighted-

quires a Governable Body, a fedate

it has a Rein which will certainly 
curb this wandring, if it can but be 
perfuaded to make ufe of it. Indeed 
Attention and deep Meditation is not

does not flatter our Pride fo well as

us a pretence to Knowledge without

from want of attention, and a hafty

That which we propofe in all our 
Meditations and Realonings is, ei- 
ther to deduce fome Truth we are 
in iearchof, from fuch Principles as 
we're already acquainted with; or 
clfe, to difpofe our Thoughts and 
Reafonings in fuch a manner, as to 
be able to Convince others of thofe 
Truths which we our felves areCon- 
vinc'd of. Other Defigns indeed 
Men may have, fuch as the Main- 
tenance of their Own Opinions, A- 
ftions and Parties without regard 
to the Truth and Jufticeof 'em, or 
the Seduftion of their unwary Neigh-

Now Reafoning being no'hing 
elle but a Companion of Ideas, an:* a 
deducing of Conciulions from Clear 
and Evident Principles, it is in the 
firft place requifite that our Ideas be 
Clear and Juft, and our Principles 
True, elfe all our Difcourfe will be 
Nonfenfe and Abfurdity, Falfliood 
and Error. And that our Idea 
may be Right, we have no more to 
do but to look attentively into our 
own Minds, having as was faid a- 
bove, laid afide all Prejudices and 
whatever may give a falfe tinfturc 
to our Light, there we fliall find a 
Clear and Lively Reprefentation of 
what we leek for, unfophifticatcd 
with the Drofs of falfe Definitions 
and unintelligible Expredions. But 
we mult not imagine that a tranii- 
entview will ferve the turn, or that 
our Eye will be Enlightened if it 
be not fix'd. For tho 7 Truth be ex-

out, the negleQ: of which Applica- 
tion is the Reafon that we have fb 
little Truth, and that the little we 
have is almoft loft in that Rubbifh 
of Error which is mingled with it. 
And fince Truth is fo near at hand, 
fince we are not oblig'd to tumble 
over many Authors, to hunt after e- 
very celebrated Genius, but may 
have it for enquiring after in our 
own Breafts, are we not inexcufable 
if we don't obtain it ?. Are we not 
unworthy of Compaffion if wefuffer 
our Underftandings to be ewer-run 
with Error ? Indeed it feems to me 
moft: Reafonable and moft agreea- 
ble to the Wifdom and Equity of the. 
Divine Operations, that every one 
Ihou'd have a Teacher in their own 
Bofoms, who will if they ferioufly 
apply themfelves to him, immedi* 
ately Enlighten them fo far as that is 
neceffary, and direft them to fuch 
Means as are fufficient for their In-

vine Truths ; for as to the latter, 
Reafon if it be Right and Solid, will 
not pretend to be our fo!e Inftru&or, 
but will fend us to Divine Revelati- 
on when it may be had. 

GOD. does nothing in vain, he 
gives no Power or Faculty which he 
has not allotted to fome proportio- 
nate ufe, if therefore he has given to 
Mankind a Rational Mind, every 
individual Underftanding ought to 
be employ 'd in fomewhat worthy of 
it. The Meaneft Perfon fhou'd 
Think as Jftftfyi tho 7 not as Capacz- 
oufly, as the greateft Philofopher. 
And if the Underftanding be made 
for the Contemplation of Truth, 
and I know not what elle it can be 
made for, either there are many 
Underftandings who are never able 
to attain what they were defignd 
and fitted for, which is contrary to 
theSuppofuion that GOD made no- 
thing in Vain, or elfe the very mean- 
eftmuft be put in a way of attaining 
it : Now how can this be if all that 
G 2 which

which goes to the compofition of a

World, be necelTary to make one fb > 
Allhavenot leifureto LearnLangua- 
ges and pore on Books, nor Oppor- 
tunity to Converfewith the Learn- 
ed ; but all may Think, may ufe their 
own Faculties rightly, and confult 
the Matter who is within them. 

By Ideas we fometimes under- 
ftandin general all that which is the 
immediate Objeft of the Mind, 
whatever it Perceives; and in this 
large Senfc it may take in all 
Thought, all that we are any ways 
capable of Difcerning : So when we 
fay we have no Idea of a thing , 'tis 
as much as to lay we know nothing 
of the matter. Again, it is more 
flriftly taken for that which repre- 
fents to the Mind fome Obje& di- 
ftinQ: from it, whether Clearly or 
Confufedly 5 when this is its import, 
our Knowledge is faid to be as Clear 
as our Ideas are. For that Idea 

which 



Propofal to the Ladies. I 2 5 

which reprefents a thing fo Clearly, 
that by an Attent 2nd Simple View 
we may difcern its Properties and 
Modifications, at lea ft fo far as they 
can be Known, is never falie; all 
our Certainty and Evidence depends 
on it, if we Know not Truly what 
is thus repreiented to our Mwds wc 
know nothing. Thus the Idea of 
Equality between 2 and 2 is fo evi- 
dent that it is impoffible to doubt of 
it, no Arguments could convince us 
of the Contrary, nor be able to per- 
fuade us that the fame may be found 
between 2 and 3. 

And as fuch an Idea as this is ne- 
ver Falie, fo neither can any Idea be 
(aid to be fo, if by Falfe we mean 
that which has no Exiftence ; our 
Idea certainly Exifts, tho' there be 
not any thing in Nature Correfpon- 
dent to it. For tho* there be no fuch 
thing as a Golden Mountain, yer 
when I think of one, 'tis certain I 
have an Idea of it.

But our Ideas are then faid to be 
Falfe, or rather Wrong, when they 
have no Conformity to the Real Na- 
ture of the Thing whofe Name they 
bear. So that properly Speaking it 
isnotthe Idea but the judgmentthat 
is Falfe $ we err in fuppofing that 
our Idea is anfa erable to fomething 
without us when it is not. In fim- 
ple Perceptions we are not often de- 
ceivd, but we frequently miftake in 
Compounding them, by Uniting fe- 
veral things which have no Agree- 
ment, and Separating others which 
are Effentially United. Indeed it 
may happen that our Perceptions are 
faulty fbmetimes, thro the Indifpo- 
fition of the Organs or Faculties, 
thus a Man who has the jAundice fees 
every thing ting 'd with Yellow, yet 
even here the Error is not in the 
Simple Idea but in the Composed 
one, for we do not miftake when 
we fay the Object appears Yellow to 
our Sight, tho' we do, when we af- 
firm that it does, or ought to do fo 

to 



Propofal to the Ladies. 1 2 7 

to others. So again, when the 
Mind does not fufficientiy Attend to 
her Ideas nor Examine them on all 
fides, 'tis very likely {lie will Think 
amifs, but this alfo is a falfe Judg- 
ment, that which is amifs in the 
Perception being rather the Inade- 
quatenefs than the Falfhood. 1 bus 
in many Cafes we enquire no far- 
ther than whether an Aftion be not 
Dire&ly Forbidden, and if we do 
not find it Abfolutely Unlawful, we 
think that fufficient to Authorize the 
Praftife of it, not considering it as 
we ought to do, Cloathed with the 
Circumftances of Scandal, Temp- 
tation, &c. which place it in the 
fameClafles with things unlawful, 
at leaft make it fo to us. 

Rational Creatures fhou'd endea- 
vour to have right Ideas of every 
thing that comes tinder their Cogni- 
zance, but yet our Ideas of Mora- 
lity, our thoughts about Religion 
are thofe which we fliouM with

greateft fpeed and diligence reftifie, 
becaufethey are of molt importance, 
the Life to come, as well as all the 
Occurences of This, depending on 
them. We fhou'd fearch for Truth 
in our mod abft rafted Speculations, 
but it concerns us nearly to follow 
her ciofein what relates to the Con- 
duct of our Lives. For the main 
thing we are to drive at in all our 
Studies, and that which is the great- 
eft Improvement of our Underftand- 
ings is the Art of Prudence, the be- 
ing all of a Piece, managing all our 
Words and Aftions as it becomes 
Wife Perfonsand Good Chriftians. 

Yet in this we are commonly moft 
faulty ; for befides the deceits of our 
Pa (lions, our Ideas of Particular Vir- 
tues and Vices, Goods and Evils, 
being an afiemblage of divers ilm- 
ple Perceptions, and including 
feveral Judgments are therefore li- 
able to miftake, and much more lb 
confidering how we commonly 
come by them. We hear the Word

fervations we make on the Pra&ice 
of fuch as Pretend to it forms. our 
Idea, which is feldom a Right one, 
the Opinions and Praflices of the 
World being very fallacious,and ma- 
ny times quite opposite to the Di- 
ctates of Reafon wou'd we but give 
ear to them. For what a ftrange 
diftorted Idea of Honor muft they 
needs have, who can think it Ho- 
nourable to break a Vow that ought 
to be Kept, and Difhonourable to 
get loofe from an Engagement that 
ought to be Broken ? Who cannoc 
endure to be tax'd with a Lye, and 
yet never think fit to keep their 
Word ? What do they chink of

What is their Idea of Heaven, who 
profefs to Believe fiich a thing, and 
yet never endeavour to Qualifie 
themfelves for the Enjoyment of it ? 
Have they any Idea at all of theft 
things when theyfpeak of em? Or, 
if they have, is it not a very falfe 
one ? 

Now that we may avoid miftake 
the better, and becaufe we ufually 
join Words to our Ideas even when 
we only Meditate, we fbou'd free 
them from all Equivocation, not 
make uft of any Word, which has 
not a DiftinQ: Idea annex'd to it, and 
where Cuftom has joined many I- 
deas to one Word, carefully feparate 
and diftinguifh them. For if our 
Words are Equivocal, how can we 
by Pronouncing fuch and fuch, ex- 
cite the fame Idea in another that is 
in our ownMind, whichis the End 
of Speech, and confequently how 
can we be Underftood ? And if 
fometimes we annex one Idea to a 
Word, and fometimes another, we 

may 



Propofal to the Ladies, ijl 

may for ever wrangle with thofe 
who perhaps wou'd be found to a- 
gree with us if we Underftood each 
other, but can neither Convince 
them, nor clear up the Matter to 
our own Mind. For Inftance .* 
Shou'd I difpute Whether Evil were 
to be Cholen? Without defining 
what I mean by Evil, which is a 
Word cuftomarily apply'd to things 
of different Natures,and fhou'd con- 
clude in the Affirmative, meaning at 
the fame time the Evil of Pain, or 
any Corporal Lofs or Punifhment, 
I were not miftaken, tho* another 
Perfon who annexes no other Idea 
but that of Sin to the word Evil, 
might Juftly contradift me and fay 
that I was. Or if in the Procefs cf 
my Difcourfe, I fhou'd without giv- 
ing notice of it, fubftitute the Idea 
of Sin inftead of that of Pain, when 
I mention Evil, I fhou'd argue falfly. 
For it is a Maxim that we may Chufe 
a lefs Evil to avoid a greater, if both 

of 



I 5 2 The Second Part of the 

of them be Corpcral Evils, or if 
one of them be fo, and we chufe it 
to avoid a Sin, between which and 
the Evil of Pain there is no Compa- 
rifon ; But if the two Evils pro- 
posed to our Choice be both of them 
Sinful, that Principle will not hold, 
we muft Chufe neither, whatever 
comes on't, Sin being Eligible no 
manner of way. 

Thus many times our Ideas are 
thought to be falfe when the fault 
is really in our Language, we make 
ufe of Words without joyning any, 
or only loofe and indeterminate Ideas 
to them, Prating like Parrots who 
can Modify Sounds, and Pronounce 
Syllables, and fometirnes martial 
them as a Man wou'd, tho without 
the ufe of Reafon or underftanding 
any thing by them. So that after a 
long Di(courfe and many fine 
Words, our Hearer may juftly ask 
us what we have been faying? And

plements pafs for nothing, they have 
no meaning, or if they have, 'tis 
quite contrary to what the Words 
in other Cafes fignifie. 

From the Comparifon of two or 
more Ideas clearly Conceived arifes 
a Judgment, which we may lay 
down for a Principle, and as we 
have occafion Argue from. Always 
cbferving that thofe Judgments 
which we take for Axioms or Prin- 
ciples, be fuch as carry the higheft 
Evidence and Convi&ion, fuch as 
every one who will but in the leaft 
Attend may Clearly fee, and be ful- 
ly convinced of, and which need 
not another Idea for their Demon- 
ftration. Thus from the Agreement 
which we plainly perceive between 
the Ideas of GOD and of Goodnefs 
fingly confider'd, we difcern that 
they may be joyn'd together fo as to 
form this Proposition, That GOD 
is Good: And from the evident 
difparity that is between GOD 

and

but what we fee Clearly, we can't 
be miftaken in our Judgments, we 
may indeed in thofe Reafbnings and 
Dedu£tions we draw from them, if 
we are Ignorant of the Laws of Ar- 
gumentation, or Negligent in the 
Obfervation of them. 

The Firft and Principal thing 
therefore to be obferved in all the 
Operations of the Mind is 5 That we 
determine nothing about thofe 
things of which we have not a Clear 
Idea, and as Diftin£i as the Nature 
of the Subje£t will permit, for we 
cannot properly be faid to Know a- 
ny thing which does not Clearly 
andEvidently appear to us.Whatever 
we fee Diftinftly we likewife fee 
Clearly, Diftin&ion always includ- 
ing Clearnefs, tho this does not ne- 
cefTarily include that, there being 
many Objefts Clear to the view of 
the Mind, which yet can't be faid to 
be Diftinft. That

Clear, but not a Diftinft and Per- 
fect Idea of G OD and of our own 
Souls • their Exigence and fome of 
their Properties and Attributes may- 
be Certainly and Indubitably 
Known, but we cant Know the 
Nature of our Souls Diftinftly, for 
Reafbns too long to be mentioned 
here, and lefs that of GOD, becaufe 
he is Infinite. Now where our 

Know- 



1 3 6 The Second Part of the 

Knowlege is Diftinft , we may 
boldly deny of a fubjeQ:, all that 
which after a careful Examination 
we find not in it : But where our 
Knowlege is only Clear, and not 
Diftinfr, tho' we may fafely Affirm 
what we fee, yet we can't without 
a hardy Prefumption Deny of it 
what we fee not. And were it not 
very common to find People both 
Talking and Writing of things of 
which they have no Notion , no 
Clear Idea ; nay and determining 
Dogmatically concerning the intire 
Nature of thofe of which they can- 
not poflibly have an Adequate and 
Diftinct one, it might ieem Imper- 
tinent to defire them to fpeak no 
farther than they Apprehend. They 
will tell you Peremptorily of Con- 
tradi£t:ons and Absurdities in fuch 
matters as they themfelves muft al- 
low they cannot Comprehend, tho 
others as Sharp fighted as them- 
felves can fee no fuch thing as they 
complain of. 

As

As Judgments are form'd by the 
Comparing of Ideas, ib Reafon- 
ing or Difcourfe ariles from the 
Comparifon or Combination of fe- 
veral Judgments Nature teaches 
us when we can't find out what Re- 
lation one Idea bears to another by 
a Simple view or bare Comparifon, 
to feek for a Common Meafure or 
third Idea, which Relating to the 
other two, we may by Comparing 
it with each of em, difcern wherein- 
they agree or differ. Our Inventi- 
on dilcovers it ielf in propofing 
readily apt Ideas for this Middle 
Term, our Judgment in making 
Choice of fuch as are Cleareft and 
mod to our purpofe, and the excel- 
lency of our Reafoning confifts in 
our Skill and Dexterity in Applying 
them. 

Invention indeed is the hardeft 
part, when Proofs are found it is 
not very difficult to manage them. 
And to know precifely wherein their 
Nature confifts, may help us fome- 

what

what in our enquiries after 'em. An 
Intermediate Idea then which can 
make out an Agreement between o- 
ther Ideas, mart be Equivalent to, 
and yet Diftin&from thofe we com- 
pare by it. Where Ideas agree it will 
not be hard to find fuch an Equiva- 
lent, and if after diligent feareh we 
cannot meet with any, 'tis a pretty 
fure Sign that they do not agree. It 
is not neceflary indeed that our 
Middle Idea be Equivalent in all re- 
fpefts, 'tis enough if it be in fuch as 
make the Companion : And when 
it is fb to one of the Compar'd Ideas 
but not to the other, that's a Proof 
that they do not agree amongft 
themfelves. 

All the Commerce and Inter- 
courfe of the World is manag'd by 
Equivalents, Converfation as well 
as Traffick. Why do we Truft our 
Friends but becaufe their Truth and 
Honefty appears to us Equivalent 
to the Confidence we repofe in em ? 
Why do we perform Good Offices 

to 



Propofal id the Ladies* 139 

to others, but becaufe there's a pro- 
portion between them and the Me- 
rit of the Perfon, or our own Cir- 
cumftances ? And as the way to 
know the Worth of things is to 
Compare them ore with another, 
fo in like manner we come to the 
Knovvlege of the Truth of 'em by 
an Equal Ballancing. But you will 
fay, Tho I may learn the value of a 
Spani(h Coin by Weighing, or Com- 
paring it with fome other Money

be done, yet where fhall I meet 
with an Equivalent Idea when I 
have occafion to ufe one ? 

In anfwer to this Demand I con- 
fider, that as Light is always vifible

it, if we turn our Eyes towards it,

rounded with it, and GOD has gi- 
ven us Faculties to receive it, If it 
be a^k'd, Why then do we fb fel- 
dom find it ? The Reafbn is, be- 
caule inftead of making right ufe of 
our Faculties we employ them in 
keeping it out; we either fbut our 
Eyes, or if we vouchfafe to open 
them, wearefure to view it thro 
fuch unfuitable Mediums as fail not 
to mifreprefent it to us. Asforthofe 
few Noble Spirits, who open the 
Windows of their Souls to let in 
Truth, and take the Films of Inte- 
reft, Paflion and Prejudice from be- 
fore their Eyes, they will certainly 
be Enlightened, and cannot mils of 
obtaining as much Truth as they are 
ca pable of Receiving. For, to go on 
with the Comparifon, as we can See 
no farther than our own Horizon, 
tho the Light (Line never fo bright 
around us ; and as we cannot dis- 
cern every Objedi even within that

Iy but what we particularly apply 
our felves to ; So neither are our 
Capacities large enough to take in 
AS Truth, as has been often faid, 
nor are we capable of attaining Any^ 
without Attention and diligent Ex- 
amination. But if we carefully Con- 
fider thofe Ideas we already have 
and Attend to thofe Truths we are 
acquainted with, we cannot want 
Mediums to difcover more, if our 
Enquiries be after that which is 
within our Reach. He who is the 
Fountain of Truth is alfo a GOD of 
Order, and has fo regularly connex'd 
one Truth with another, that the 
difcovery of one is a ftep towards a 
further Progrefs ; fo that if we dili- 
gently Examine thofe Truths which, 
we Know, they will clear the way 
to what wc fearch after : For it fel- 
dom happens but that the Queftioh

142 The Second Part of the 

There is no ObjeQ:,no Accident of 
Life but affords us matter of Inftru- 
aion. GOD has fo difpos'd all the 
Works of his Hands, all the AQings 
of his Providence, that every one of 
'em minifters to our Improvement, 
if we will but Obferve and Apply 
them. Indeed this Living Ex Tem- 
pore which moft of us are guilty of, 
our making no Refle&ions, our Gay 
and Volatile Humour which tranG 
ports us in an Inftant from one thing 
to another, e're we have with the 
Induftrious Bee fuck'd thofe Sweets 
it wou'd afford us, frequently ren- 
ders his gracious Bounty ineffe&ual. 
For as the Diligent-hand maketh

creafes them, and the moft Obferv-

that has at any time preferred it 
felf. And perhaps the difference be- 
tween one Womans Reafon and 
anothers may confift only in this, 
that^ the one has amals'd a greater 
number of fuch Ideas than the o- 
thcr, and difpos'd them more Or-

they are at hand, ready to be ap- 
ply a d to thofe Complex Ideas whole 
Agreement or Disagreement can- 
not be found out but by the means 
offomeof 'em. 

But becaufe Examples are more 
familiar than Precepts, as conde- 
fcending to fhe w us the very manner 
of Praftifing them,Ifhall endeavour 
to make the matter in Hand as. plain 
as I can by fubjoining Inftarjces to 
the following Rules, which Rules 
as I have not taken wholly on Truft 
from others, fo neither do I pretend 
to be the Inventer of 'em. 

We have heard already that a 
Medium is neceflary when we can't 
difcern the Relation that is between 

two 



144 The Second Part of the 

two or more Ideas by Intuition or a 
fimple View. Could this alone pro- 
cure us what we leek after, the addi- 
tion of other Ideas wou'd be needlefs, 
finceto make a fhew of Wit by tedi- 
ous Arguings and unneceffary Flou- 
rifhes, does only Perplexand Incum- 
ber the Matter, Intuition being the 
Simpleft, and on that account the 
beft way of Knowing. 

Rule I. And therefore we fhou'd 
in the firft place, Acquaint our felves 
throughly with the St ate of the Que ft ion, 
have a Diftincl Notion of. our SubjecJ 
whatever it be, and of the Terms we 
make ufe of, knowing precifely what it 
U we drive at : that fo we may in the 
fecond 

Rule II. Cut off all needlefs Ideas and 
whatever has not a necejfary Connexi- 
on to the matter under Confederation, 
which ferve only to fill up the Capa- 
city of the Mind, and to Divide and 
Diftraft; the Attention. From the neg- 
lect 



Propofal to the Ladies. 1 45 

left of this comes thofe cauflefs Di- 
greflionSjtediousParentheies and Im- 
pertinentRemarques which wc meet 
with in fome Authors. For, as when 
our Sight is diffus'd and extended 
to many Obje&sat once we fee none 
of them Diftmctly ; fo when the 
Mind grafps at every Idea that pre- 
fents it (elf, or rambles after fuch as 
relate not to its Prefent Bufinels, it 
lofes its hold and retains a very fee- 
ble Apprehenfion of that which it 
fhouM Attend. Some have added 
another Rule (viz.) That we Reafon 
only on thofe things of which we have 
Clear Ideas ; but I take it to be a Con- 
lequence of the firft, and therefore 
do not make it a diftinfl: one : For 
we can by no mcansUnderftand our 
Subjeft, or be well acquainted with 
the State of the Queftion, unlefs we 
have a Clear Idea of all its Terms. 

Rule III. Our Bufinefs being da- 
ted, the next Rule is To conduct our 
Thoughts by Order ) beginning with the 
H mofi 



1 46 The Second Part of the 

mofl Simple and Eafie Objetts, and 
*[cending as by Degrees to the Kjaow- 
lege of the more Compos d. I need 
not tell you, that Order makei every 
thing, Eafie, Strong and Beautiful, 
and that the Superftru&ure is nei- 
ther like to Laft or Pleafe unlefs the 
Foundation be duly laid, for this is 
obvious to the moft Superficial Rea- 
der. Nor are they likely to fblve 
the Difficult, who have neglefled 
or flightly pafsM over the Eafie 
Queftions. Our Knowledg is gra- 
dual, and by paffing Regularly thro 
Plain things, we arrive in due 
time at the more Abftrufe. 

Rule IV. In this Method we are 
to pra&ife the Fourth Rule which 
is, Not to leave any part of our 
Subjeft unexamwd, it being as ne- 
ceflary to Confider All that can 
let in Light, as to fhut out what's 
Foreign to it. We may flop Ihort 
of Truth as well as over-run it; and 
tho we look never Co attentively on 

our 



Prof of al to the Ladies. 1 4 7 

our proper Objeft, if we view but 
half of it, we may be as much mis- 
taken, as if we extended our Sight 
beyond it. Some Obje£ts agree ve- 
ry well when obferv'd on one fide, 
which upon turning the other fhew 
a great difparity. Thus the Right 
Angle of a Triangle may be like to 
one part of a Square, but compare 
the Whole, and you'l find 'em very 
different Figures. And a Moral 
Aftion may in fbme Circumftance 
be not only Fit but Neeeffary,which 
in others, where Time, Place, and 
the like have made an alteration, 
wou'd be moft Improper ; fo that 
if we venture to Ad on the former 
Judgment, we may eafily do amift, 
if we wou'd Act as we ought, we 
mud view its New Face, and fee 
with what Afpeft: that looks on 
us. 

To this Rule belongs that of D/- 
vidingthe Subject of our Meditations 
into as many Parts, as • tve can 4 and as 
{ball be rtqmfite toVndtrfland it per- 
il 2 ftUly.

fecily. This is indeed moil neccffary 
in difficult Queftions, which will 
fcarce be unravell'd but in this man- 
ner by Pieces : Ever taking care to 
make Exaft Reviews,and to Sum up 
our Evidence juftly e're we pais Sen- 
tence and fix our Judgment. 

Rule V. To which purpofe we 
mull A hays keep cur Subject Dire&fy 
in our Eye, and Cloftly purfue it thro 
all our Progrefs ; there being no better 
Sign of a good Underftanding than 
Thinking Clofely and Pertinently, 
and Reafoning dependency, fb as 
to make the former part of ourDif- 
courfe a fupport to the Latter, and 
This an Illuilration of That, carry- 
ing Light and Evidence in ev'ry 
ftep we take. The negleft of this 
Rule is the Caufe why our Difcove- 
ries of Truth are feldom Exafr, 
that fb much is often (aid to fo lit- 
tle purpofe ; and many Intelligent 
and Indufirlous Readers when they 
lave Read over a Book are very lit- 
tle 



Profofal to the Ladies. 149 

tie wifer than when they began it. 
And that the two laft Rules may be 
the better obferv'd, 'twill be fit very 
often to look over our Proctis fa 
far as we have gone, that fo by ren- 
dring our Subjeft Familiar, we may 
the fooner arrive to an Exa£l Know- 
lege of it. 

Rule VI. All which being done 
we are in a fair way towards keep- 
ing the laft Rule, which is, To judge 
no further than we Perceive, and not 
to take any thing for Truth which we 
do not evidently Know to be fo. In- 
deed in fome Cafes we are fcfrc d to 
content our felves with Probability, 
buttwere well if we did fo only 
where 'tis plainly Neceflary. That 
is, when the Subjcfl of our Medita- 
tion is fuch as we cannot* poiTilK 
have a Certain Knowlege of, becaufe 
we are not fumififd with Proofs 
which have a Conftant and Immu- 
table Connexion with the Ideas we 
apply them to, or becaufe we can't 
H 3 per- 



1 5 o The Second Part of the 

perceive it, which is our Cafe ia 
fuch Exigencies as oblige us to ASt 
prefently, on a curlbry view of the 
Arguments proposal to us, when wc 
want time to trace them to the bot- 
tom, and to make ufe of fuch means 
as wou'd dhcover Truth. 

I cannot think we are often driv- 
en to fuch ftraits in any confidera- 
ble Affair, tho I believe that very 
many Subjeds may be propos'd to 
us, concerning which wecannot rea- 
dily pais our Judgment, either be- 
caufe we never confider'd them be- 
fore, or becaufe we are wanting in 
feme Means that lead to the Know- 
kge of 'em. In which Cafe Reafbn 
wills that vvefufpend our Judgment 
till we can be better Inform'd ; nor 
wcu'd it have us remit our Search af- 
terCertamty , even in thofe very Cafes 
in which we may fbmetimes be 
fore'd to Adi only on Probable 
Grounds. For Reafbn can't reft fa- 
tisfv'd with Probabilities where 
iividence is poflible, our Paffions and 

In- 



Prof of alto the Ladies, i 5 1 

Intereft- may, but That does not in- 
cline us to leave off Enquiring left 
we happen to meet fomew hat con- 
trary to our Defires. No, Reafon 
requires us to continue our Enqui- 
ries with all the Induftry wecan,till : 
they've put us inPoffeflion of Truth, 
and w hen we have found, enjoyn* 
us to follow her, how oppofite fo- 
cver fhe may caufe our Latter Acti- 
ons to be to our Former. But by 
this we may learn (and fo we may 
by every thing that fuch weak and 
fallible Creatures as weare,perform) 
to think Candidly of thofe whofe 
Opinions and A&ions differ from 
our own. Becaufe we do not know 
the neceffity of their Affairs, nor in 
what ill Circumftances they are 
placed in refpeft of Truth. 

And now to Apply what has been 
faid ; The State of theQueftion be- 
ing Diftinftly known, and certain 
Ideas fixt to the Terms we make 
ufe of, wefhall find fometimes that 
the Difference which wasfuppos'd 
H 4* t# 



1 5 2 The Second Part of the 

to be between the Things them- 
felves, is only in words, in the di- 
vers ways we make ufe of to ex- 
prefs the Tame Idea. 

For if upon looking into our 
felves we difcern, that thefe differ- 
ent Terms have but one and the 
fame Idea, when we have correfted 
our Expreflbns the Controverfie is 
at an End, and we need enquire no 
further. Thus, ' If we are ask'd 
Whether GOD is Infinitely Perfe3 ? 
There needs no Intermediate Idea 
to compare the Idea of GOD with 
that of Infinite Perfection, fince we 
may difcern them on the very firft 
view to be one and the fame Idea dif- 
ferently exprefs'd, which to go about 
to explain or prove were only to 
cumber with needlefs words, and to 
make what is Clear, Obfcme. For 
we Injure a Caufe inftead of Defend- 
ing it, by attempting an Explanati- 
on or Proof of things fo Clear, that 
as they do not need, fo perhaps they 
are not Capable of any. 

But 



Propofal to the Ladies. 153 

But if it be made aQueftion Whe- 
ther there is a GO D, or a Being In- 
finitely Per feci ? We are then to Ex- 
amin the Agreement between our 
Idea of G O D and that of Exigence. 
Now this may be difcern'd by Intu- 
ition, for upon a View of our Ideas 
we find that Kxiftence is a Perfecti- 
on, and the Foundation of all other 
Perfe&ions, fince that which has no 
Being cannot be fuppos'd to have 
any Perfe&ion. And tho the Idea 
of Exigence is not Adequate to that 
of Perfe£tion, yet the Idea of Per- 
feftion Includes that of-Exiftence, 
and if That Idea were divided into 
parts, one part of it wou'd exactly 
agree with This. So that if we will 
allow that Any Beirg is Infinite in 
All Perfc£tions,we cannot deny that 
that Being Exifts; Exiftence it flif 
being one Perfeftion, and fuch an 
one as all the reft are built upon. 

If unreafbnable Men wilt farther 

demand, Why is it ntcefliry that A- 1 

Perfection fbotid be fintrtd in One 

H S ' Being, 



1 5 4. *the Second Part of the 

Being , *V/ not enough that it be par eel 1 *d 
out among ji many 7 And tho it be true 
that that Being who has all Perfection 
rnafl needs Exift, yet where j the Ne~ 
iejjity of an A 11- Perfect Bei»g ? We. 
inuft then look about for Proofs and 
Intermediate Ideas, and the Ob- 
je£tion it felf will furnifh us with 
one. For thofe Many whole Parti- 
cular Ideas it wou'd have joyn'd to- 
gether to make a Compound one of 
All-PerfeCtion, are no other than 
Creatures, as will appear if we con- 
ilder our Idea of Particular Being and 
of Creature, which are fo far from 
having any thing to diftinguifh 'em, 
that in all Points they referable each 
other. Now this Idea naturally fug- 
gefts to us that of Creation, or a 
Power of giving Being to that which 
before the exerting of that Power 
had none, which Idea if we ufe it as 
a Medium, will ferve todifcover to 
us the ncceflicy of an All- Perfect Ee- 



iag 



For in the firft place, what ever 

. has 



Prcpofal to the Ladies. 1 5 5~ 

has any Perfeftion or Excellency 
(for that's all we mean.by Perfects 
on here) mud either have it of it 
felf, or derive it from fome other 
Being. Now Creatures cannot have 
their Perfe&ions from themfelves be- 
cauiethey have not their Being, for 
to fuppofe that they Made them- 
felves is an Abfurdity too ridiculous 
t<5 be ferioufly refuted, 'tis to fup- 
pofe them to Be and not to Be at 
the fame time, and that when they 
were Nothing, they were able to do 
the greateft Matter. Nor can they 
derive either Being or Perfe&ion 
from any other Creature. For tho 
fome Particular Beings may feem to 
be the Caufe of the Perfections of 
others, as the Watch-maker may be 
laid to be the Caufe of the Regular 
Motions of the Watch, yet trace it 
a little farther, and you'l find this 
very Caufe fhail need another, and 
fo without End, till you come to 
the Foundation-head, to thu All- 
Perfe£t Being, who is the laft refort 

of 



1 5 6 the Second Pari of the 

of our Thoughts, and in whom they 
Naturally and Neceflarily reft and 
terminate. If to this it be Obje&ed 
that we as good as affirm that this 
All-PerfeQ: Being is his own Maker, 
by faying he isSelf-Exiftent, and 
fo we fall into the fame Abfurdity 
which we iroputfed to that Opinion 
which fuppofes that Creatures wtrc 
their own Maker. The reply is eafie, 
That we do not fay he Made him- 
felf, we only affirm that his Nature 
is fuch, that tho we can't fuffici- 
ently Explain becaufe we can't com- 
prehend it, yet thus much we can 
difcern, that if he did not Exift of 
himfeif no other Being could ever 
have Exifted. So that either All 
■muftvbe fvvallow'd up in an Infinite 
Nothing, if Nothing can properly 
have that Epithet, and we muft 
fuppofe, that neither weourfelvcs, 
nor any of thole Creatures about us 
ever had, or ever can have a Being, 
which is too ridiculcus to imagine, 
or elfe we muft needs have recourfe 

to 



Propofal to the Ladies, 1 5 7 

to a Self-Exifting Being, who is 
the Maker and Lord of all things. 
And fince Self Exiftence muft of ne- 
ceffity beplacM fbmewhere, is it 
not much more Natural and Rea- 
fbnable to place it in Infinite Per- 
fection, than amongft poor, frail 
Creatures, whofe Origin we may 
trace, and whole End we fee daily 
haftning ? 

To Sum up all; Since there are 
Innumerable Beings in the World, 
which have each of them their fe- 
veral Excellencies or Perfe&ions ; 
Since thefe can no more derive their 
Perfe&ions than their Being from 
themfelves or from any other Crea- 
ture ; Since a Self-Exifting Being is 
the refult of our Thoughts ; the 
Firft and only True Caufe, with- 
out whom it is impofllble that any 
thing fliould ever have Exifted} 
fince Creatures with their Being re- 
ceive all that depends on it from 
him their Maker ; Since none can 
give what he has nor, and therefore 

he

he wiio Communicates an innume- 
rable variety of Perfe&ions to his 
Creatures, even all that they enjoy, 
muft needs contain in himfelf all 
thofe Beauties and Perfeftions he is 
pleased to Communicate to Inferior 
Beings ; nothing can be more Plain 
and Evident than that there is a 
GOD, and that the Exiftence of an 
All-Perfe& Being is Absolutely ne- 
ceffary. 

Perhaps thefe Arguments are not 
in Form, I do not ublige my Self to 
follow fervilely the Rules of Art, 
nor know I what better Judges will 
think of 'em, but they feem to me 
to be Clear, Rational and Conclud- 
ing, which is all I aim at. And I 
hope the Reader will receive from 
hence more light into the way of 
Arguing, than (he couM havegain'd 
had I fpenr a? many Pages in pre-

with theufual way of Syllogifm, and 
think an Argument cannot be right' 
ly managed without one, for their 
Satisfaction we will add another In- 
ftance. 

Suppofe the Queftion were put 
Whether a Rich Man is Happy? By 
a Rich Man underftanding one who 
poffefles theWealth and Good things 
of this World, and by Happy the 
Enjoyment of the Proper Good of 
Man. We compare the two Terms 
Riches and Happinefs together, to 
difcern if they be fo much one and 
the fame, that what is affirm'd of the 
oae may be faid of the other ; . but 
we find they are not. For if Riches 
and Happinefs were terms Converti- 
ble, then all who are Happy muft 
be Rich, and all who are Rich muft 
beHappy, to affirm the laftofwhich 
is to beg the Queftion, and the con- 
trary appears by the following Ar- 
gument, which makes ufe of Satis* 
faff ion with ones own Condition for the 
middle Idea or Common Meafure. 

He 



1 6 c The Second Part of the 

He who is Happy is fatisfied with 
his Condition and free from An- 
xious Cares and Solicitude (for thefe 
proceeding from the want of Good, 
he who enjoys his proper Good can- 
not befubjeft to them. ) But Riches 
do not free us from Anxieties and 
Solicitude,they many times encreafe 
them, Therefore to be Rich and to 
be Happy are not one and the fame 
thing. 

Again, If there arc fome who arc 
Happy and yet not Rich, then Ri- 
ches and Happinefsare two diftinft 
things. But a Good Poor Man is 
Happy (in the Enjoyment of GOD 
who is better to him than Thou- 
fands of Gold and Silver,) therefore 
Riches and Happinefs are to be di- 
ftinguifh'd. 

We may further con fider, that if 
the Enjoyment of Riches can make 
a Man Happy according to our No- 
tion of Happinefs, they ntiuft be his 
Proper Good. Now if we compare 
the Idea of Riches with that which 

we 



Propofal to the Ladies* 1 6 1 

we have of Man, we fhall find in the 
former nothing but what's Material, 
External and Adventitious, but our 
Idea of? the latter reprelents to us 
fomevvhat that Thinks, and fois of 
an Immaterial and more noble Na- 
ture, a Nature altogether different 
from the former, and much more 
excellent and Superior to it ; and by 
Confequence the lefs Noble cannot 
be the Good of the more, nor a Bo- 
dy or an Extended Subftance, the 
Proper Good of the Mmd, a Spiritu- 
al or Thinking Subftance. So that 
upon the whole matter wefind, that 
we cannot agirm a Man is Happy 
becaufe he is Rich, neither can we 
deny it ; Riches confider'dabfolute- 
ly in 'emfelves, neither make a Man 
Happy nor hinder him from being fo. 
They Contribute to his Happinefs 
or they Obftruft it according to the 
Ufe he makes of em.

from the Sophiftry of thofe who ufe

an Argument fairly, fo long as it is 
Tenable, and till we are driven from

be able to hold an Argument Right 
or Wrong may pafs with fome per- 
haps for the CharaQer of a Good 
Difputant, which yet I think it is 
not, but muft by no means be ai- 
low'd to be that of a Rational Perfon; 
it belongs- to fuch to detect as foon 
as may be the Fallacies of an ili one, 
and to eftablifh Truth with the 
Cleared Evidence. For indeed 
Truth not Viflory is what we fhou d 
contend for in all Difputes, it being 
more Glorious to be Overcome by 
her than to Triumph under the Ban* 
ners of Error. And therefore we 
pervert our Reafbn when we make 
it the Inftrument of an Endlefs Con- 
tention, by feeking after Quirks and 
Subtikies, abufing Equivocal Terms, 

and

and by pra&ifing the reft of thofe 
iittle Arts every Sophifter is full of, 
which are of no fervice in the difco* 
very of Truth, all they can do is to 
Ward off an Opponents blow, to 
make a Noife and raife a Duft, that 
fo we may efcape in the Hurry, our 
Foil being undifcover'd. 

It were endlefs toreckon up all the

we may be pleas'd in the Contem-

that Vain-glory, Secular Intereft, 
Ambition or perhaps Senfuality or 
Pvevenge, or any the like contemp-

We can readily fay that it is Pride 
or Obftinacy, Intereft or Paffion or 
in a word Self-love that keeps our 
Neighbour from Conviftion, but all 
this while imagine our o vn Hearts 
are very clear of 'em, tho' more Im-

'Tis hop'd however that the greateft

caufe they are not aware of it thern-

ought to be the Temper of every

We all pretend to this it's true, 
and think our felves Injured if it 
be not believ'd that we are Difin- 
terefs'd and free from Paffion, that 
no Humour or Private End, nothing 
but an honeft Zeal for Truth gives 
warmth to our Diicourfes 5 and yet 
it often happens that e're we Con- 
clude them, we give juft occafion to 
have it thought, that how large fb- 
ever our Knowlege in other things 
may be, we arc not well acquainted 
with our own Hearts. All which 
confider'd, how confidently foever 
we're perfwaded of our own Inte-

it wou'd not be amifs to fufpeft our

even at the very inftant we take

is fo much our Intereft as a readinefs 
to admit of Truth, from what ever 
Hand it comes, greateft part of our 
Difputes wou'd have a better Iffue 
than we generally find. At leaft if 
we cou'd not be fo happy as to Con-

wou'd be manag'd with more Tem-

If we conlider wifely we fhall 
find it to be our Prefent Intereft as 
well as cur Future, to do that in 
Reality which all of us Pretend to, 
that is, to Search after and to Pol- 
low Truth. And to do it with all 
that Candor and Ingenuity which

as a good ChriftiaiH making ufe of

generality, and to which we make 
all other confiderations give place ; 
For what is it we Contend for ? 
They who have fuch little Souls as 
to bait at any thing beneath the 
higheft End, make Reputation 
their Aim, and with it that Autho- 
rity and Wealth which ufually at- 
tends it. But now Reputation can- 
cot be acquired, atleaft notalafting 
one, by Fallacious Reafonings ; we 
may perhaps for a while get a Name 
by them amongft unwary Perfons, 
but the World grows too quick- 
fighted to be long impos'd on. If a 
Love of Truth do not, yet Envy 
and Emulation will fet other heads 
a Work to difcover our Ignorance 
or Fraud, they are upon the fame 
Defign, and will not iuffer us to go 
away with the irize undefervedly. 
And befides,' with how ill an At 
pe£t muft he needs appear who does 
not Reafon fairly , and by confe- 
quence, how unlike is he to gain on 
thofe who hear him ? There are but 

three 



Proptfal to the Ladies. I Jt 

three Caufes to which falfe Arguments 
can be refer'd, Ignorance, Rafhnefs, 
orDefign, and the being fufpedted 
for any one of thefe hinders us ve- 
ry much in acquiring that Reputa- 
tion, Authority or Preferment we 
defire. I muft confefs were we fure 
the Fallacy wouM not be dete&ed, 
and that we fhou'd not lie under 
Sufpicion of it, we might gain our 
point; for provided the Paint do 
not rub off, good Colouring may* 
ferve a prefent turn as well as a true 
Completion : But there is little rea- 
fon to hope for this, becaufe of what 
was juft now mention d, and for 
other Reafbns that might be ad- 
ded. 

Now what can be more provok- 
ing than the Idea we have of a De- 
signing Perfon? of one who thinks 
his own Intelleftuals fo ftrong and 
ours fo weak, that he can make us 
fwallow any thing , and lead us 
where he pleafes ? Tuch an one feems 
to have an Intention to reduce us to 
I 2 the 



JJ2 The Second Part of the 

the vileft Slavery, the Captivation 
of our Underftandings, which we 
juftly reckon to be the higheft Info- 
lence. And fince every one puts in 
for a (hare of Senfe, and thinks he 
has no reafbn to complain of the di- 
ftribution of it, whoever fuppofes 
that another has an over-weaning 
Opinion cf his own , muft needs 
think that he undervalues his Neigh- 
bours Underfianding, and will cer- 
tainly repay him in his own Coin, 
and deny him thofe advantages he 
feems to arrogate. 

The mod we can fay for our felves 
when the weaknefs of our Argu- 
ments comes to be difcover'd, is that 
we were miftaken thro Rafhnefs or 
Ignorance, which thomore pardona- 
ble than the former, are no recom- 
mending Qualities. If we argue 
falfly and know not that we do i'o, 
wefhali be more pittied than when 
we do, but either way difappointed. 
And if we have added RafhCenfures 
ofthcfe who are not of our Mind,

Pride or PoGtivenefs to our Errors 
as we cannot fo handfomely Retreat 
fb neither will (o fair a Quarter be 
allow'd as thofe who Argue with 
Meeknefs, Modefty and Charity 
may well expeft. So that when we 
have caft up our Account and efti> 
mated the Prefent Advantages that 
falfe Arguings bring us, I fear what 
we have got by a Pretence to Truth, 
won't be found to countervail the 
lofs we fhallfuftainby the Difcovery 
that it was no more. Which may 
induce us (if other Confiderations 
will not) to be wary in receiving any 
Propofitionour felves, andreftrain u& 
from being forward to irapofe our 
Sentiments on others. 

After all, 'tis a melancholy refle- 
xion that a great part of Mankind 
ftand in need of Arguments drawn 
from fo low a Motive as Worldly 
Intereft, to perfuade them to that 
to which they have much great- 
er inducements. It is ftrange 
that we fhou'd need any other con-

pos'd to thofe who ftudy to recom- 
mend themfelves to him, for our 
Encouragement, how low are we 
funk if the ApplaufeofMenand the 
little Trifles which they can beftow 
weigh any thing with us ! I am 
therefore almoft afham'd of propo- 
fing fo mean a confideration, but the 
degeneracy of the Age requir'd it, 
and they who perhaps at firft follow 
Truth as the Jews did once, for the 
Loaves only, may at laft be attract- 
ed by its own Native Beauties.

much better than Rules of Art,

who reflect on the Operations of 
their own Minds will find out em- 
felves. The common Precepts of 
Rhetoric may teach us how to re- 
duce Ingenious ways of fpeakipg to 
a certain Rule, but they do not teach 
us how to Invent them, this is Na- 
tures work and fhe does it beft ; there 
i as much difference between Natu-

is between Paint and True Beauty. 
So that as a good Au-

any more than I did that Wrangling 
which goes by the name of Logic, 
and which teaches to difpute for and

whether they are True or Faife. lc 
is an abufe both of Reaibn and Ad-

a Trifle or an Untruth ; and a mi- 
ftake to think that any Argument 
can be rightly made, or any Dif- 
courfe truly Eloquent that does not 
illuftrate and inforce Truth. For 
the defign of Rhetoric is to remove 
thofe Prejudices that lie in the way 
of Truth, to Reduce the Paffions to 
the Government of Reafon 5 to place 
our Subjeft in a Right Light, and ex- 
cite our Hearers to a due confi- 
deration of it. And I know not 
what exa&nefs of Method, pure and 
proper Language, Figures, infinua-

for when we pretend to teach others,

no wonder that we do it at a fbrry

not openly own, or which if it be diC 
cover'd he has a mind to evade. And 
fometimes even an honeft and good- 
Writer who ftudies to avoid may

Not that it is neceflary to exprefs

And fince the Clearnefs and Con-

In a word, I know not a more 
compendious way to good Speaking

mod excellent in either as a Model 
on which to form our felves. Or 
rather to imitate the Perfections of 
all, and avoid their miftakes $ for 
' few are fo perfe£t as to be without

Bad, nor admits the Bad becaufe of 
the Good that is mingled with it.

This affefts a Grave that a Florid

for Plainnefs, a third for Strength, 
and a fourth for Politenefs. And 
perhaps the great fecret of Writing 
is the mixing all thefe in (b juft a pro-

proper than Pride and Pofitivenefs, 
nor any thing more prevalent than 
an innocent compliance with their 
weaknefs : Such as pretends not to 
diftate to their Ignorance, but only 
to explain and illuftrate what they 
did or might have known before if 
they bad confider'd it, and fuppofes 
that their Minds being employ'd a- 
bout fome other things was the reafon 
why they did not difcern it as well 
as we. For Human Nature isnot will- 
ing to own its Ignorance ; Truth is 
fo very attraftive, there's fuch a na- 
tural agreement between our Minds 
and it, that we care not to be 
thought fo dull as not to be able to 
find out by our felves fuch obvious 
matters. We fhou'd therefore be 
careful that nothing pafs from us 
which upbraids our Neighbours 
Ignorance, but ftudy to removed 
without appearing to takenotice of 
it, and permit'em to fancy if they

And fince many wou'd yeild to the

the fharae of being overcome, we 
ftiou'd Convince but not Triumph, 
and rather Conceal our Conqueft 
than Publifh it. We doubly oblige 
our Neighbours when we reduce 
them into the Right Way, and keep 
it from being taken notice of that 
they were once in the Wrong, which 
is certainly a much greater fatif- 
faftion than that blaze of Glory which

plaufe which will foon be over. For

Cleared Evidence were delivered 
only by way of Enquiry, fince even 
the brightest Truth when Dogmati- 
cally diftated is apt to offend our Rea-

the way to be good Orators is to be

with ; and have pluck'd up thofe 
Vicious Inclinations from whence the 
moft diftaftful faults of Writing pro- 
ceed. For why do we chufe to be 
Obfcure but becaufe we intend to 
Deceive, or wou'd be thought to lee 
much farther than our Neighbours ? 
One fort of Vanity prompts us to be 
Rugged and Severe, and fb poffefs'd 
with the imagin'd Worth and Solidi- 
ty of our Difc our fe, that we think it 
beneath us to Polifh it : Another 
difpcfes us to Elaborate and Affefted 
ways of Writing, to Pompous and 
improper Ornaments; and why are 
we tedioufly Copious but that we 
fancy every Thought of ours is ex- 
traordinary ? Contradi&ion is indeed

as wifer, yet our Pride makes us 
impatient under it, becaufe it feems 
to Leflen that Efteem and Deference 
we defire fhou'd be paid us. Whence 
come thole fharp Reflections, thofe 
imagin'd ftrains of Wit, not to be 
endur'd amongft Chriftians, and 
which ferve not to Convince but to 
Provoke, whence come they but 
from 111- nature or Revenge, from a 
Contempt of others and a defire to

I have made no diftinftion in what

which do not always meet, yet 
there is no material difference be- 
tween em. They Write beft per-

tho it takes more with fbme Auditors 
many times than Good Senfe, there 
needs little be faid of it here, fince 
Women have no bufinefs with the 
Pulpit, the Bar or St. Stephens C^p*

fpelling which they're faid to be de- 
fective in, if they don't believe as 
they're ufually told, that its fit for 
'em to be fo, and that to write 
exa&ly is too Pedantic, they may 
foon corre£t that fault, by Pronoun- 
cing their words aright and Spelling 
'em accordingly. I know this Rule 
won't always hold becaufe of an Im- 
perfe&ion in our Language which 

has

yet amended ; But in this cafe a little 
Obfer vation or recourfe to Books will 
a (Tift us; and if at any time we happen 
to miftake by Spelling as we Pro- 
nounce, the fault will be very Venial, 
and Cuftom rather to blame than we. 
I've faid nothing of Grammar tho 
we cant Write properly if we tran£ 
grefs its Rules, fuppofing that Cu- 
ftom and the reading of Englifh 
Books are fufficient to teach us the 
Grammar of our own Tongue, If 
we do but in any meafiire attend to 
them. And tho Women are gene- 
rally accus'd of Writing falfe Englifh, 
rf I' may fpeak my own Experience, 
their Milfakes are not fo common as 
is pretended, nor are they the only 
Perfons guilty. What they moft 
commonly fail in is the Particles and 
Connexion, and that generally thro 
a Brisknefs of temper which make 
them forget, or Haft which will not 
fuffer em to read over again what 
went before. And indeed, thofe 
K whe

After all, it may not be amift to 
take notice that Ornaments are

Clearnefs and ftrength of Reafoning

They endeavour to refute, or if they 
can't do that, to Ridicule the con-

new ones, for it requires no great 
skill to Objefl, and there are many 
Truths which we're very Certain of, 
and yet not able to anfwer every 
Impertinent Enquiry concerning 
em. Their greateft Art is in con- 
founding things, in giving a probable 
Air to what they write, in pretend- 
ing to Demonftration where the na- 
ture of the Truth does not required, 
and in evading it where it does. An 
Immoral or Heretical Difcoirrfe 
therefore may be Cunningly but not 
well writ, for we can never plead for 
Error and Vice with true Eloquence. 
We may trick'em upinahandfbm

lot The Second Part of the 

Affair and trucft Excellency, the o- 
ther are no further to be regarded 
than as they may a (11 ft us in this. 
She who does not draw this Infer- 
ence from her Studies has Thought 
in vain, her notions are Erroneous 
and Miftaken. And all her Elo- 
quence is but an empty noife, who 
employs it in any other defign than 
in gaining Prolelytes to Heaven. I 
am therefore far from designing to 
put Women on a vain purfuit after 
unnecefiary and ufelefs Learning, 
nor wou'd by any means perfuade 
them to endeavour after Knowledge 
coud I be convinc d that it is impro- 
per for 'em. Becaufe I know very 
well that tho a thing be never fb ex- 
cellent in it felf, it has but an ill 
grace \i it be not fuitable to the Per- 
fbn and Condition it is apply'd to. 
Fine Cloaths and Equipage do not 
become a Beggar, and a Mechanic 
who muft work for daily bread for 
his Family, wouM be wickedly Em- 
ployM fhou'd he fuffer 'em to ftarve

whileft he'9 folving Mathematical 
Problems. If therefore Women have 
another Duty incumbent on 'em, and 
fuch as is inconfiftent with what we 
here advife, we do ill to take them 
from it : But to affirm this is to beg 
the Queftion, and is what I will 
never grant till it be better prov'd 
than as yet it appears to be. For if 
the Grand Bufineft that Women as 
well as Men have to do in this World 
be to prepare for the next, ought 
not all their Care and Induftry to 
Centre here ? and fince the matter is 
of Infinite Confequence is it equitable 
to deny em the ufe of any help? If 
therefore Knowledge were but any 
ways Inftrumental, thoat theremot- 
eft diftance, to the Salvation of our 
Souls, it were fit to apply our felves 
to it ; and how much more when it 
is ib neceflary, that without it we 
can't do any thing that's Excellent, 
or Praftife Vertue in the moft Per- 
feft manner. For unlefs we Uoder- 
ftand our Duty and the Principles 

of 



204 The Second Part of the 

of Religion, we don't perform a Ra- 
tional Service, it is but by Chance 
that we are Good or fo much as 
Chriftians. We are their Property 
into whofe hands we fall, andareled 
by thofe who with greateft Confi- 
dence impole their Opinions on us ; 
Areas moveable as the different Cir- 
cumftances that befall us; or if we 
happen to be Conftant in our firft 
way, it is not Reafon but Obftinacy 
that makes us fb. A great deal of 
Good will be omitted, and very 
much Evil, or Imperfeftion at leaft, 
flick to us, if we are not throughly 
acquainted with the Law of God and 
the fecret fprings and windings of 
our Hearts, which isfcarce to be ob- 
tained without much Meditation and 
the helps that ftudy affords. 

And as when a rafh young Travel- 
ler is about to run into dangerous pla- 
ces befet with Theives and full of Pre- 
cipices, if you have any hearty con- 
cern for his fafety, you'l not think it 
enough barely to {hew him his way, 

or 



Profofal to the Ladies. 20 J 

or even to tell him of the Danger, e- 
fpecially ifthe entrance feems fair and 
inviting and treacherous Compani- 
ons are upon the watch to decoy him 
into it: But you'l expole it in all 
its frightful Circumftances, endea- 
vour to quicken his vigilance and ex- 
cite his Paffions, and all little enough 
for his Security. So it cannot be 
thought fufficient that Women fhou'd 
but juft know whats Commanded and 
what Forbid, without being inform'd 
of the Reafons why, fince this is not 
like to fecure them in their Duty. 
For we find a Natural Liberty 
within us which checks at an In- 
junction that has nothing but Autho- 
rity to back it ; And tho Religion 
is indeed fupported by the Strongeffc 
Reafons, and inforc'd by the moft 
powerful Motives, yet if we are not 
acquainted with 'em, tis all one to 
us as if it were not. But having 
fpoke of this in the firft part wc 
fliall not farther enlarge on it here. 
Perhaps it will be objected that 

we've 



to 6 The Second Part of the 

we've laid the great Truths of Religion 
carry a force and Evidence fated to the 
very Vulgar, and that GOD has not 
defigrid All for Philofofhers. And 
therefore if the way to the moft ne- 
ceflary Knowlege be fo very plain, 
and all Capacities are not fitted for 
higher attainments, what needs this 
ado about th' Improvement of our 
minds ? the only thing neceflary is 
to be good Chriftians, and we may 
be that without being Philofbphers. 
Suppofewe may; This will Juftify 
fuch as want Time and Capacity, 
but can never excufe the Sloth and 
Stupidity of thofe who have both. 

For unlefs we have very ftrange 
Notions of the Divine Wifdom we 
mull needs allow that every one is 
placed in fuch a Station as they are 
fitted for. And if the neceffity of 
the world requires that fbme Perfbns 
fhou'd Labour fcr others, it likevvife 
requires that others fhou'd Think 
for them. Our Powers and Faculties 
were not given us for nothing, and 

the

the only advantage one Woman has 
above another, is the being allotted 
to the more noble employment. No 
body is placed without their own 
fault, in fuch unhappy Circumftan- 
ces as to be incapable of Salvation, 
but fbme are placM in fuch happy 
ones as to be capable of attaining 
much greater degrees of Happinefs 
than others if they do not negleft 
them : And fhou'd thefe laft do no 
more than the very utmoft that is 
expefted from the former, I know 
not how they wou'd acquit them- 
felves , or what account they cou'd 
give of their great Advantages. And 
therefore tho no body fhall be con- 
demned becaife they CotSd not, yet 
we have reafbn to fear if our Cafe be 
fuch as that we Might but fVou'd not 
receive Inftruftion. She then who 
makes this Objeftion muft: not take 
it amifs if we Judge of her in other 
Cafes according to what fhe Pleads 
in this: She muft never let up for a 
Wit, or a cenfurer of her Neigh-

and Another to Chule and Delight 
in't thro a Stupid Carelefnefs, a fear

ring any Thought or Motion, of Di- 
recting them to This or That thing 
rather than to another is what we 
mean by the Will.- Whofe Regulari- 
ty confifts in a conftant Tendency 
towards fuch things as ought to be 
PreferM,orina word, in Conformi- 
ty to the Will of GOD. That 
G O D's Will is the Rule of ours is 
methinks fo plain that it needs nc 
proof; for why do we Prefer a thing 
but becaufe we Judge it Beft ? and 
why do we Chufe it but becaufe ii 
Seems Good for us ? Now G O D be- 
ing Infinitely Wife all his Judgment; 
muft be Infallible, and being Infi- 
nitely Good he can Will nothing bui 
what is beft, nor prefcribeany thing 
that is not for our Advantage. This i! 
I dare fay what every one Thinks 
if they think at all about the matter 
and is the Rule they wouM Aft by 
did they give thetnfelves leave upor 
•all t3Ccafions duly to Confid'eranc 
Weigh what is proposM to them. 
But as there are fome Ideas whicf

our Underftandings receive fo earl/ 
that they feem to be born with us, 
which are never totally abfent from 
our minds, and are in a manner the 
fource of all thereft^ifo there are 
certain Motions or Inclinations in- 
separable from the Will, which pulh 
us on to the ule of that Power, and 
determine it to the Choice of fuch 
things as are moft agreeable to them. 
Nor fhou'd we do amifs in following 
thefe Inclinations did they keep that 
Imprefllon which the Author of Na- 
ture gave them, which is towards 
Good in general, or towards him- 
felf, for he only is our True Good, 
and thefe are the Wings of the Soul 
which fhou'd carry it on vigoroufly 
towards him. 

Whether there is not in us an In- 
clination to do what is F/>, that is 
to think and Ad agreeably to a Ra- 
tional Nature, without confidering 
our own particular advantage I fhall 
not here difpute. For whether this 
be fo or no, tis certain that m our 
L prefent 



ii 8 The Second Part. of the 

prefent Circumftances, we cannot 
feparate Fit and Good in Reality, 
tho we may have diftinft Ideas of 
them. What is really proper for 
Rational Creatures to do, tending 
neceflarily 'ttflheir Happinefs, and 
nothingbeing able to make them[tru- 
]y Happy but that which is fit to 
be done. Befides, fo pure an. Incli- 
nation being wholly abftra&ed from 
Self- Love and Prejudice isnotfubjeft 
to any Irregularity, and fo needs not 
be fpoken of herfe ; and perhaps fo 
few are acquainted wiih it, that it 
will hardly be known what we mean 
by it. 

An Inclination therefore after 
Happinefs is that to which we (hall 
,at prefent reduce all the reft j which 
Happinefs we purfue by remo- 
ving as far as we can from that 
which is uneafie to us, and by uni- 
ting our fclves as much as we are 
able tofomeGood which we fuppofe 
we want. The former of thefe be- 
ing indeed a purfuitof Good, tho 

not

not Co Dire&ly as the latter. Good 
then is the Objeft of the Will,' and 
hitherto one woud think there were 
no probability of our ftraying from 
.the Will of GOD, and that there 
were fo little need of advifing us to 
Will as GOD Wills that it is impof- 
fible we fhou'd Will otherwile } 
becaufe whenever we oppofe our 
Wills to his, we change in a manner 
the very Conftitution of our Na- 
ture and fly from that Happinefs 
which we wouM purfue. 

But the mibfortune is as has beea 
once obferv'd already, that we Will. 
e're we are capable of examining the 
Regions of our Choice, or of view- 
ing our Ideas foexaftly as we muft 
if &e wou d Judge aright. And the 
frequent repetition of fuch unrea- 
fonable Choices makes them Cu- 
ftornary to us, and confequently 
gives a new and wrong bias to our 
Inclinations, which upon all occaf:- 
ons difpofe the Will totheChoice of 
fuch things as we fuppofe, tho by 
L 2 miftake,

ons which are certain Commotions 
ia the Bloud and Animal Spirits ac- 
companying thefe Inclinations, de« 
fign'd in the Order of Nature for 
the good of the Body,as the Inclina- 
tions were intended for the Good 
of the Soul, dofb unite us to fenfi- 
ble things, and reprefent em with 
fuch advantage, that Spiritual Good 
which feems at a greater diftance re- 
lifhes very little, and abftra&ed 
Truths do not find us fo Impartial 
as to examin them throughly, and 
to give them their due Weight, 
when they 're ballanc'd againft fuch 
things as may be Sqqh and Felt ; 
thefe being com mo a iy preferred , 
not for their intrinfic worth, but 
for their outward Shew and the Bulk 
they carry. 

That we always endeavour 
to be Happy is fufficiently evident, 
and that we too frequently fly from 
GOD who only can make us fo,

Which cou'd not be did we notgrof- 
\y miftake our Happinefs, as we cer- 
tainly do whenever we Will any 
thing in oppofition to the Will of 
GOD, whatever Appearance of 
Good it may .happen to carry. Tis 
true the Will does always purfuc 
Good, or lomewhat reprefented to 
it as fuch, but it is not always, or 
rather very feldom, determin'd to 
the Choice of what is in it felf the 
greateft Good. And though I fup- 
pofe we always Chufe that which ia 
that Jun&ure in which it is pro- 
posed feems fitted for our preftnt 
turn , yet it is often fuch as wc 
uoud not prefer, did we impartial- 
ly examin and obferve the Conse- 
quences. But we will not do that, 
xhufing rather to Aft by the Wrong 
Judgments we have formerly made, 
and to follow blindly the Prppenfi- 
ties they have given us, than to fuf- 
pend our Inclinations as we both 
May and Ought, and reftrain them

from determining our Will, till we 
have fairly and fully examin'd and 
ballanc'd, according to the beft of 
our Knowledge, the feveral degrees 
of Good and Evil prefent and future 
that are in the Objefts let before us. 
The neglect of which i§ at once both 
our Fault and Milery ; Our Fault 
in that we precipitate our Choice, 
refufing to Confider Efficiently to 
reftifie our Miftakes. And our 
Mifery becaufewe (hall certainly be 
Difappointed (coxier or later, and be 
convinced that what was Co Haftily 
and Unteafonably Chofea, ought 
not even then to have been prefer'd, 
how Pleafant foever it appear'd , 
feeing it neither Was nor Coud be 
Good for us. 

It feems indeed the greateft won- 
der in the. World hoW any Man. in 
his Senfes can prefer the Abort Plea- 
fures ,of Sin , which are attended 
even in this Life with Pain and 
Shame, and a thoufand Inconveni-

Vertue, and the Profpeft of a Feli- 
city Infinite and Eternal, if he does 
at all compare them. An Eternity 
of Jovs mult needs be preferable ta 
Fifty" or Threefcore Years of Sinful 
Pleafures, weigh them in what 
Scales you pleafe , and fuppofing 
thefe much greater than ever any 
Sinner found 'em, efpecially ftncc 
they are attended with Eternal Pains, 
and no perverfe Inclination can 
make us think otherwife if it will 
allow us to confider. But it wilt 
not allow Consideration , or if it 
does a little permit it, it deceives us 
however with fallacious Saicoes. It 
fixes our Thoughts on a Prefent Uq- 
eafinefs which it fays mull be re- 
mov'd, and our Defires gratify'd at 
any rate , without fuffering us to 
weigh the ill Confequences of doing 
fo. And perhaps the Wrong bias 
which we receive from our Evil In- 
clinations does not confift in the per- 
f hading us that a Prefent Sinful 
Pleafinc or Profit, is the Grcateft 
L 4, Good, 



2 24 The Second Part of the 
Good, or that it ought to be Pre- 
fer'd before the Favour of GOD and 
Eternal Beatitude, which whenever 
we Think of we muft needs ac- 
knowledge to be infinitely greater, 
but in keeping us from a full Convi- 
Sion that th' one can't be Chofen 
without Renouncing th 7 other, and 
in making us unwilling to examine 
throughly, left we fhou'd want the 
pretence of Ignorance or Paffion to 
excufe-what our Conferences can't 
bunReproach us with as an unwor-

So that the great aggravation of 
Sin Items toconfift in this, That 
the commiflion of it is a pretending 
to be Wifer or Stronger than GOD, 
an attempt toout-withim by Fine- 
nefs, or elfe by plain Force to wreft 
his Felicity from him whether he 
Will or no. For feeing we always 
Will Happinefi, and yet wou'd be

Dcfire, and an Endeavour fo far. as 
we're able to Oppofe and Alter his

Happinefs, tho he has declar'd they 
can't be reconciled, and made it in 
the ordinary courfe of things impof -

The Will of GODthenis the Rule 
of ours, and if it be ask'd how we 
fhall come to the Knowledg of it ? 
the Anfwer is ready , that the 
Eternal Word and Wifdomof GOD 
declares his Fathers Will unto us, 
by Ktufon which is that Natural and 
Ordinary Revelation by which he 
fpeaks to every one ; and by that 
which is call'd Revelation in a ftritter 
Senfe, which is nothing elfe but a 
more perfefl: and infallible way of 
Reafbning, whereby we are Clearly 
and Fully inftrufted in ib much of 
GOD's Will as is fit for u&to know. 
We muft therefore Improve our

After all, the beft way to be fur- 
ther Inftru&ed in the Knowledg of 
our Duty is to Pra&ife fo much of it 
as we Know already. By keeping 
GOD's Commandments, we get 
fuch a found and ftrong Conftitutioa 
of Soul, as leads us naturally to our 
True Good. For as a healthy per- 
fon whofe Taft is not vitiated, is di- 
rected by that, without examining 
the Philofophy of Body s to fuch 
things as are fit for the nouriflhmenc 
of his own : So a Divine Scnfatioa 
gives us a lively relifh of what's 
Good, and a perfeQ: avtrfion to the 
contrary. It endues the Soul not 
only with a Sagacity of Undemand- 
ing to difcern readily what is beflv 
but likewife with fuch a Regularity 
of Will, as makes it even Hate and 
Abhor all evil ways. 

A mod: defirable Temper no 
doubt, the very top . of Human Fe- 
licity, but how (hall wc obtain it f 
We 'find our felves under the power 
of quite contrary Inclinations and 

Relifhes-

ReHflies, and how to get rid of a em 
we know not. This is indeed a ve-

thing that deferves our Sorrow, yet 
the Cafe is not fo defperate, but that 
by the help of an Almighty Phy- 
fician we may be Cured , if in 
good earneft we fet about it. And 
becaufethe not difcerning our true 
Happinefeand the being accuftom'd 
to purfue a felfe one is the caufe of 
our Diforder, fomewhat muft be 
done by way of Meditation and 
fomewhat by way of Exercife. 

Now I know not any Subje&s 
more proper for our Meditation on 
this and all occafions, than our own 
Nature, the Nature of Material Be- 
ings, and the Nature of GOD; be- 
caufe it is thro the miftake of fbme 
of thefe that our Inclinations take a 
wrong bias, and confequently that 
we tranfgrefs againft GOD , our 
Neighbour and our (elves. For did 
we confider what we Are, that Hu- 
mane Nature confifts in the Union

of a Rational Soul with a Mortal 
Body, that the Body very often 
Clogs the Mind in its nobleft Ope-

That we ftand not fingly on our

Form, efpecialiy to the Communi- 
ty amongft whom we live, and yet 
more particularly to thole feveral 
Relations we may have in it. Did

proper Duties and Enjoyments of 
fuch a nature as ours, that is, what 
performances do naturally refult from 
thole Capacities we find our felves. 
endow'd with,which may therefore 
bereafonably expefted from us, and 
what fort of Pleafures we are made 
to relifh. Again, were we fb far 
at leafl: Philofophers^ as to be able to, 
pafs a due eftimate on Material Be-

not to prize them above their real 
value. Did we in the laft place con-

that Idea of Infinite Perfection which 
he has giv'n us, Frequently, Seriouf- 
ly and Humbly Meditate on what 
he has been pleas'd to unveil. Did 
we but employ fo much of our Time 
and Thoughts on thefe things as we * 
do on our Sins and Vanities, we 
fhou'd not be long in difcerning the 
good effefts. 

For 1 queftion not but that we 
fhou'd be convinced that the Body is 
the Inftrument of the Mind and no 
more, that it is of a much Inferior 
Nature, and therefore ought to be 
kept in fuch a Cafe as to be ready 
on all occalions to ferve the Mind. 
That the true and proper Pleafure 
of Human Nature confifts in the ex-

crcifeofthat Dominion which the 
Soul has over the Body, in govern- 
ing every Paflion and Motion ac- 
cording to Right Reafon, by which 
we molt truly purfue the real good 
of both, it being a miftake as well of 
our Duty as our Happinefs to confi- 
der either part of us fingly, fo as to 
neglect what is due to the other. 
For if we difregardthe Body whol- 
ly, we pretend to live like Angels 
whilft we are but Mortals; and if 
we prefer or equal it to the Mind we 
degenerate into Brutes. The for- 
mer indeed is not frequent, it is on- 
ly to be found amongft a few Scru- 
pulous Perfons, whofbmetimes im- 
pofe fuch rigors on the Body, as 
GOD never requires at their hands, 
becaufe they are inconfiftent with a 
Human Frame. The latter is the 
common and dangerous fault, for 
the mod of us accuftom our felves

as it is ufually undei flood has a very 
ill Charafterand is the Root of Evil, 
yet rightly apply'd it is Natural and 
Neceffary, the great inducement to 
all manner of Vertue. They can- 
not be faid to Love their Body who 
wou'd not willingly fuffer a little 
pain in a Finger to preferve an Arm, 
much more to fa ve their Life ; nor do 
they in reality love themielves, who 
wou'd not readily fuffer any uneafi-

and who do jiot prefer the leaft pro-

deavour to perfuade us that our 
Good is here, tho a little Confidera- 
tion, if not our frequent dilappoint- 
ments when we feek no further , 
were fufficient one wou'd think to 
convince us that it is not. For when 
we come to weigh em in an impar- 
tial Confideration we difcern, that 
as they are GOD's Work they have 
a Perfeftion fuitable to their feveral 
Natures, and are asperfeft as is con- 
fident with the feveral Ranks and 
Stations they are plac'd in, ib that 
confider'd Pofitively they are not to 
beContemn'd, fince they fet forth 
the Wifdom, Power and Goodnefi 
of their Maker. But if we compare 
them with the Human Soul they 

ap-

appear of little value, and of none at 
all in companion of Him who made 
them ; and fince their Nature is be- 
neath, and their Worth much lefs 
than ours, we cannot find our Ha p- 
pineis in em. They contribute 'tis 
true to the Prefervation and Eafe of 
the Body, they help to make it fit 
for the Service of the Mind ; But 
fince a very few of 'em will do this, 
the reft are but a load and trouble, 
fo far from being ufeful, that they 
indeed hurt us, unlefs they're made 
to minifter to Charity and Contem- 
plation. 

Let then thefe little things be 
drawn afide, thefe Clouds that hide 
the mod adorable Face of G O D 
from us, thefe Mud-walls that en- 
clofe our Earthly Tabernacle and 
will not- fuffer us to be piere'd with 
the Beams of his Glory, and wound-

Arrows of his Love and Beauty. In 
him we find that infinite Good

without whom we fhall for ever 
Languifh and Grieve ; Enjoying 
whom we h&ve nothing to Fear, nor 
any thing to Hate but what wou'd 
deprive us of that Enjoyment. If 
we confider how much he has done 
to render us capable of this Happi-

what affronts he has put up, with 
what Patience he bears our Follies 
and fblicits otir Return, in a Word,

As to what is to be done by way

the means of the Animal Spirits.

And when outward Ob jeftsoccafion 
fuch Commotions in the Bloud and 
Animal Spirits, as are attended with 
thoft Perceptions in the Soul which 
we call the Paffions, (he can't be in- 
fenfible of or avoid 'em, being no 
more able to prevent thefe firft Im- 
preffions than fhe is to ftop the Cir- - 
culation of the Bloud, or to hinder 
Digeftion. All fhe can do is to Con- 
tinue the Paffion as it was begun, or 
to Divert it to another Obje£t, to 
Heighthen or to let it Sink by degrees, 
or fbme way or other toModifieand

which is what we call Virtue, which

confifts in governing Animal Im- 
preflions, in direfting our Paffions 
to fuch Objefts, and keeping 'em in 
fuch a pitch, as right Reafbn re- 
quires. 

By which it appears that it is not 
a fault to have Paffions, fince they 
are natural and unavoidable , and 
ufeful too ; for as the Inclinations 
are the Wings of the Soul, fo theft 
give Life and Vigor to the Inclinati- 
ons, by difpofmg the Body to aft ac- 
cording to the Determination of the 
Mind. But the fault lies here, we 
fuffer em too often to get the Ma- 
ftry of the Mind, to hurry it on tc 
what Ob'je&s they pleafe and to fix 
it there, fo that it is not able to con- 
fider any Idea but what they pre- 
fent. Whereas the Soul can if {he 
pleafe, and if (lie makes ufe of her- 
Authority in time, divert the Courfe 
of the Spirits, and direQ'em to a 
new Objeft, by Limiting or Ex-: 
tending her Ideas, and by layingt: 
aiide thofe the Paffions excited, andi

entertaining new ones. Nay, if 
we do but forbear to revolve fuch 
Confiderations as are apt to continue 
the Commotion of the Spirits, it 
will ceafe of it felf. This is what 
we can and ought to do, and if we 
do not perform it, we a£l rather 
like the Slaves of Senle than Crea- 
tures endued with Reafon 5 but if 
we do, we can hardly receive any 
Injury from the Paffions. 

The way therefore to Govern 'em 
is to be always in a Temper fit for 
this, Recollefl: and Compos'd, hold- 
ing our Minds in as even a poife as: 
ever we can between Mirth and 
Melancholy, one of which Stupifies 
the Soul and the other Diffolves it ; 
and both of 'em weaken and difpofe 
it for Paffion. Nothing but what 
feeds the ill humor will make Im- 
preffion whilft it is under the pow- 
er of this, nor any ufeful thing ftay 
in it, but it lies open to all manner 
of evil, when it is violently agitated 
by that. .Too much of either ren-

dring us unfit to Converfe with our 
felves or others 5 fuch a mixture of 
both as makes us Serious without 
Sournefs, and Chearful without Le- 
vity, being the happy Temper. It 
is by furprize that the Paffions in- 
jure us, they violently attack our 
Reafon when {he is not prepar'd to 
receive them, Co that the Will is de- 
termin'd all of a fudden by Confute 
Perceptions and Senfations. Nor is 
it eafie to repulfe them when once 
they have gain'd ground, becaufe 
they often bribe our Guard, and 
get the Maftry of us by thofe very 
Considerations which fhou'd have 
been arm'd againft 'em. But Re- 
colle&ion, a ledate and fbber frame 
of Mind, prevents this Mifchief, it 
keeps our Reafon always on her 
Guard and ready to exert her felf ; 
it fits us to Judge truly of all occur- 
rences, and todrawadvantage from 
whatever happens. This is thetrue 
Art of Prudence, for that which 
properly (peaks us Wife, is the ac-

commodating all the Accidents of 
Life to the great End of Living. 
And fince the Paffivenefs of our 
Nature makes us liable to many Suf- 
ferings which we cou'd with to 
avoid, Wifdom confiftsin the ufing 
thofe Powers, which GOD has giv- 
en us the free difpofal of, in fuch a 
manner, as to make thofe very 
things which befal us againft our 
Will, an occafion of Good to us. 

For if we do not live like Ma- 
chines, but like Reafbnable Crea- 
tures, that is if we Obferve, Exa- 
mine and Apply whatever comes un- 
der our Cognizance, every Turn in 
our own and our Neighbours Life 
will be Ufeful to us. It is not to be 
deny'd that we're generally Critical 
Oblervators on our Neighbours, 
but I'm afraid it is with an 111 not a 
Good Defign. We do't to feed our 
Pride by an ungenerous infulting 
over their Infirmities, or thinking 
to Excufe and Juftifieour own Faults 
by theirs. But we feldom fet a

or note their Falfe Steps, that ours 
may be more Exatt. 

And indeed as things are ufually 
manag'd, finceModefty, Breeding, 
or Sheepifh Cowardife, reftrains 
even thofe who are capable of bet- 
tering Converfation, irom Edifying 
Difcourfes, the only ufe we can 
make of that Time which the World 
borrows of us and NeceiTary Civili- 
ty exa&s, is to lay in Matter ofOb- 
fervation. I do not mean that we 
Chou'd make Ill-natur'd Remarks, 
or Uncharitable Reflexions on Par- 
ticular Perfons, but only that we 
take notice of the feveral workings 
of Huma-ii Nature, the little turns 
and diftiiiftions of Various Tern- 
pers ; there being fomewhat peculi- 
ar almoft in every one, which can- 
not be learn'd but by Conversation 
and the Reflections it Occafions. 
For as to the main, we learn it by 
looking into our own Hearts, one

another, fo that they whothorowly 
Know themfelves have a right Idea 
of Mankind in general, and by ma- 
king realbnable allowances for Cir- 
cumstances, may pretty well guefs 
at Particulars. 

But even the Know ledge of our 
felves is not to be had without the 
Temper here recommended. . For 
fince the Paflions do moftly depend 
on the Conftitution of the Body, 
Age, Education and way of Living; 
fo that the fame Objeft does not on- 
ly Affeft feveral Perfbns differently, 
but varioufly moves the very fame 
Perfon at feveral Seafons; and there 
was once a time perhaps, whenthat 
which puts us now in a ferment had 
no power to move us: We muft 
therefore to the general confiderati- 
on of Human Nature already fpoken 
of, add a more minute inquiry 
into our own; Obferving our Parti- 
cular Pafliony, that efpecially to 
which we're moft inclin'd by Na-

our particular way of ufing it that 
determines our Thoughts and Ani-

tinual Watch and Application can 
procure us a fufficient Acquaintance 
with our felves, we cannot well dif- 
cern what Obje&s moft fenfibly 
touch us ; which is our wcakeft

or Strengthened; how we may Re- 
ftrain cr rightly Employ a Paffion

quently grow ftrong by our very 
Infirmities, whilft we make them 
an occafion of Exercifing and En-

indeed one of the befl: Books we can 
Study, efpecially in refpeft of Mo-

why we're no better Proficients in 
ufeful Knowledg, is becaufe we 
don't duly confult i'. 

Again, we fbouM endeavour to 
render Spiritual and Future things 
as Prefent and Familiar as may be, 
and to withdraw as much as we can 
fromfenfible Impreffions, efpecial-

our Duty, to be more indifferent to 
the Qbje&s of Senfe than the moft 
of us are. For we certainly do 
amifs if we fix our Eyes and

M 5 Again, 



2JO 7 he Second Part of the 

Again, the Paffions confident as 
Bodily Impreffions only, excite us 
many times to the Gratification of 
the Animal in prejudice of the Rati- 
onal Nature. For tho Mankind 
had Originally no Appetites but 
what might Innocently be fatisfi- 
ed 5 yet fince our Degeneracy, and 
that we have loft the true Re- 
lifh of Good and Evil, they often 
give us falfe alarms, ftirring us up 
to Purfue or Avoid what indeed we 
Ought not, if weconfult our Good 
in the Main, and not the pleafing of 
a Part, nay the Worft part of us. 
But if we confider em as attending 
our Inclinations, they can do no 
hurt, let'em be as Brisk and AQive 
as they can, provided they fix on 
their Proper Obje&s. Now what 
thefeare'is to be found by the Na- 
ture of the Paffions, by which we 
are led to the Ufe of 'em, fince eve- 
ry thing ought to be employ 5 d about 
that which it is fitted for. But this 
being already accounted for by Des 

Cartes 



Propofal to the Ladies. 2$ t 

Cartes and Dr. More, in u$ 
his excellent Account of &?$*£* 
Vertue, I cannot pretend 
to add any thing to what they have 
fo well Difcours'd. Only as a fur- 
ther confirmation of what has been 
already fa id we may obferve 5 That 
Admiration gives Rife to all the 
Paffions ; for unlefs we were A£- 
> fefted with the Newnefs of an Ob- 
ject, or fome other remarkable Cir- 
cumftance, fo as to be attentively 
engag'd in the Contemplation of it, 
we Ihou'd not be any wife mov'd, 
but it wou'd pafs by unregarded. 
And therefore 'tis very neceffary 
not to be ftruck with link things* 
or to bufie. our Minds about em, but 
to fix all our Attention on, and to 
keep all our Admiration for things 
of the greateft moment, fuch as are 
thofe which relate to another 
World. 

We may further oblerve, that 
there is a leading Paffion almoft \w 
every one, to which the Temper of 

their 



252 The Second Part of the 

their Body inclines, and on which 
the reft do in a manner wholly de- 
pend, efpecially if it he confirm'd by 
Education and Cuftom, fo that if 
we. duly manage /fc, we have the 
Command of all. Some are more 
fubjeft to Fear, fome to Hope, to 
Joy, Sorrow or the like, than others; 
but Love feems to be the predomi- 
nant Paffion in every one, and that 
which makes one of the former more 
remarkable than another, is only 
becauie it has been oftner mixt with 
Love. And indeed, fince this is at 
the bottom of all the Paffions, one 
wou'd think they're nothing elfe 
but different Modifications of it, 
occafionM by fome Circumftance in 
the Subject orObjeft of ttiisPaflion. 
Thus Dtfire is a Love to Good con- 
lider'd as Future; Hope the Paflion 
that difpofes us to believe we may, 
and Fear that we fhall not obtain it. 
Joy is a pleaiant Commotion of the 
Soul in the Fruition of the Good we 
Love j and Sorrow a difagreeable one 

oc-

occafion'd by the w ant of it, or pre- 
tence of its contrary. The like 
may be faid of the reft, for even 
Hatred tho it appear dire&Iy oppo- 
fite to Love, may be refer'd to ir, 
the very fame motion that carrys the 
Soul towards Good, carrying he^ 
alio from thofe things which wou'd 
deprive her of it, which on that ac- 
count are call'd Evils, and why do 
we Hate any thing, but becaufe it 
does fome way or other hinder our 
Enjoyment of what we Love ? 

If therefore our Love be Right, 
the reft of our Paffions will of courfe 
be fo ; and our Love which is a 
motion of the Soul to joy n it f elf to that 
which appears to he grateful to it, will 
then be right when our Notions of 
Good and Evil are ; That is, when we 
do nottake up with Imaginary orPar- 
ticular, but pafs on to the Sovereign 
Good, toGOD whois the only proper 
and adequate Objedt of our Love, as 
Sin is of our Hatred, all things elfe 
being no otherwife to be Purfued or 

Avoided

that if we Love GOD with All our

that our Defires will be carried out 
after nothing but GOD, and fuch 
things as may further our Union 
with Him. His Favour, and the 
Light of His Countenance will be 
the Objeft of our Hopes, nor lhall 
we much Fear any thing but His 
Difpleafure. No Grief will pierce 
our Heart but for our many Offences 
againft, and our ImperfeQ; Enjoy-

what Difficulties won't our Courage 
furmount, when th' Enjoyment of

be the only occafion of Shame \ for 
Reproach from Men when fuffer'd 
for His fake will be counted a high

Contemn'd and Right Reafon vio-

when the Worthlefs are Prefer'd, 
and Merit is left unregarded. His 
Favourites will be ours, we fhall 
difpenfe our Good will to every one

which refults from the right ufe of 
our Faculties, and Fruition of the

natural Effe£t as well as the Reward 
of an Ardent Love to GOD, and 
what neceffarily flows from it, Uni-

Pleafure which the World can nei-

Enjoys the Prefent, and has no Soli-

So far (by the way ) is Religion 
from being an Enemy either to Na-

true U(e of the Creatures, keeps us 
from expeQing more in them than 
we can ever find, and leads us to 
the Enjoyment of the Creator who

To fan&ifie our very Infirmities, 
to make even the diforderly Com- 
motions of our Spirits an occafion of 
producing Holy Paffions. It were 
better indeed if they were rais'd 
upon a right Principle; that the 
Paffions did not move the Mind, but 
the Mind the Paffions ; and that the 
Motives to Religion were notSenfi-

in their Hearts and Legible in their 
Lives and Anions. 

Now in order to this, if our 
guard has been furpriz'd, and fbme 
fenfible Impreffian has ftrongly 
broke in upon us, fo that we find 
our felves all in a ferment, let us 
manage the Opportunity difcreetly, 
change the Objeft and hallow the 
Paffion. Which is no very difficult 
thing, for when a Paflion is boyling 
it will fpend it felf on any Objefifc 
that we pleafe to fix it on. And the 
Proper Obje&s of our Paffions, be- 
ing moft confiderable in 'emfelves, 
and naturally moft apt to move us if 
we'll but give them fair play, that 
is allow em a place in our Thoughts, 
they'll work out the other, and 
make our Paffions what theyfhoud 
be: We have a plain Inftanceof this

in Affli&ions, in which our Grief is 
at firft excited by fome outward 
Caute, and when that has foftned 
us, the Spirit of GOD who is ne- 
ver wanting unlefs we Negleft or 
Quench him, improves this World- 
ly into a Godly Sorrow that worketh 
Repentance not to be Repented 
of. 

Befides, as there is a Pleafure in 
thePaflionsas well as in all the ge- 
nuine Operations of Nature, fb 
there's a Pain accompanying 'em 
when mifplac'd, which difpofes the 
Mind toareadinefs toieftifie them, 
that fo it may enjoy the Pleafure 
without mixture of Pain. If there- 
fore weaffift it with a little Medita- 
tion, it will readily come over $ and 
tho we may find it difficult abfo- 
lutely to quafa a Pafiion that is once 
begun, yet it is no hard matter to 
transfer it, fo that it may pour forth 
it felf in all its pleafing tranfpom, 
without fear of danger, or mixture 
of uneafinefs. 

But

But a Caution will not be amifs, 
which is, that we don't miftake the 
Fits of Paffion for a Spirit of Piety 
and Devotion. They are good be- 
ginnings 'tis true, but if we're only 
wafted up to Heaven in our Clofets, 
and fhew forth nothing or very lit- 
tle of it in our Lives and Converfa- 
tions, we may cheat our felves with 
the conceit of being Holy, but nei- 
ther GOD nor Man will be fb im- 
posed on. She who mourns for her 
Sins, tho never fo bitterly, and yet 
returns to them at the next occafion, 
gives a very good Evidence of her 
Weaknefs, but none of her Repen- 
tance. She who pretends to never 
lb great tranfports of Love to GOD, 
and yet is wedded to the world, can 
part with nothing for his fake, nor 
be content and eafie when He only 
is her Portion, gives Him good 
words, and makes Him many fine 
Complements and that's the whole 
of the matter. She who makes fhew 
of great Awe and Reverence to- 
m wards

wards the Divine Majefty at Church 
and has no regard to Him in the 
World his larger Temple, as good 
as declares that (he thinks his Pre- 
fence confind to a place, or that (he 
hopes to commute a Days negled 
for an Hours Obfervance, and ex- 
prefles her Con tempt of GOD much 
mere than her Veneration. How 
can (he profefs to Hope in Him who 
is Anxious and Solicitous about the 
leaft Event ? Or fay that her De- 
fires are fix't on GOD who has a 
great many Vanities and Senfual Ap- 
tites to be Satisfied . ? 

Nor are we lefs out of the way 
when we tincture our Religion 
with our Paflions, and fafhion an 
Idea of it according to our own 
Completion not the tenor of the 
Gofpel. Hence comes that great 
diverfity we meet with both in Pra- 
ctice and Theory, for as there is 
fome\> hat Peculiar almoft in every 
ones Temper, fb is there in their 
Religion. Is our Difpofition Sad

Religion is not our Joy but our 
Task and Burden , we become ex- 
tremely fcrupulous and uneafie to 
our felves and others. And if Re- 
fblution and Daring be joy n'd with 
our Melancholy, and Temptations 
fall pat in our way,wedifcard fucha 
troublefome Religion and fet up for 
Atheifm and Infidelity. On the 
other hand, if we're Fearful and 
Timerous our Superftition has no 
bounds, we pay lefs regard to thole 
Laws our Maker has prefcrib'd, 
than we do to thole Chimera's our 
own Fancy has invented to recon- 
cile Him. A miftake which the 
Brisk and Jovial are fenfible of, but 
not of the contrary extreme they 
run into; they difcern that COD's 
ways are ways of Pleafantnefs, and 
all his Paths are Peace, that Good 
Chriftians live the Happieft Lives, 
'tis their Duty to Rejoyce evermore, 

and

and all the good things of the World 
are at their fervice. All which is 
very true, but then it is as true, 
that their Pleafures are not Senfual 
but Rational and Spiritual, which is 
not a leflening, but an Addition to 
their Chara&er ; that we are to Ufe 
the World fb as not to abufe either 
our (elves or it, to teftify on all oc- 
cafions our Moderation and Con- 
tempt of it, to be ready to quit it, 
nay even to part with Life it felf 
when ever they come in competition 
with our Duty. In a word, if our 
Anger againft our own Sins pro- 
vokes us to be Peevifh with others, 
tho not 10 good as they fhouM be, it 
goes too far. If our Zeal finds fault 
with all who do not come up to our 
Heights, or who don't exprefs their 
Devotion in our way, it is not ac- 
cording to Knowlege, that is, it is 
not Difcreet and Chriftian. If our 
great Love to GOD takes us up fo

greeable way : And I dare fay it 
wou'd be more acceptable to Him, if 
infted of fpending it all in Rapture 
and Devotion, a part of it were em- 
ployed in Imitating his Beneficence 
to our Fellow-Creatures, 

To wind up all; The Sum of our 
Duty and of all Morality, is to have 
a Temper of Mind fo abfolutely 
Conformed to the Divine Will, or 
which is the fame in other words, 
fuch an Habitual and Intire Love 
to GOD, as will on all occafions ex- 
cite us to the Exercife of fuch A&s y 
as are the neceffary confequents of 
fuch a Habit. This frame and Con- 
ftkution of Soul is what we muft all 
our Life time Labour after, it is to 
be begun, and fome Proficiency 
made in it whilft we ftay on Earth, 
and then we may joyfully wait for

per but Imperfe£tly. The want of 
which isthe Hell of the Damn'd, the 
degree of their mifery bearing a pro- 
portion to their oppofition to the 
Divine Will. For Happinefs is not 
without us, it rauft be found in our 
own Bofoms, and nothing but a 
Union with GOD can fix it there ; 
nor can we ever be United to Him 
any other wife than by being like 
Him, by an Intire Conformity to 
his Will. 

Now (he who has obtain'd this 
blelfed Temper, whofe Will is 
Right, and who has no Paffion but 
for GOD's Servicers pleas'd that his 
Wifdom fhou'd Chuie her Work, 
and only prepares to difpatch it with

nefs. She keeps All his Precepts, 
and does not pick and Chufe fuch as

GOD's Approbation. Indeed the 
Conqaeft of our Vanity is one of 
our laft Triumphs, andaSatisfa&ion 
in all GOD's Choices for us, from a 
full Coaviftion that they are moft 
for our advantage, the beftTeftof 
a Regular Will and Affeftions, For 
thefe are heights to which we can't 
arrive till we have traversM over air 
the Paths of Vertue, and when once 
our Paffions are reduced to this, I 
know not in what they can oppofe 
us. 

Not but that we're ftriftly obligd 
to Provide for honefi things in the 
Sight of Men as well as of GOD, to 
do nothing but what is of Good Re- 
port ; te Abftainfrom all Appearance of 
Evil; not togive Occufon of Slander 
to thole who defire and Seek it; but 
to Let cur Light fo {bine before Men, 
that they may fee our Good-works and 
Glorify our Father who is in Heaven. 
But when we have done this, and 
have taken all poffible care to ap- 
prove

prove our felves to GOD and. Man, 
can we be ac Eafe if we fail in the 
latter f Arc we more defirous of a 
Good than a Great Reputation? and 
wou'd we not to get a Name a* 
mongft our Fellow Servants, do 
any thing that may in the leaft Of- 
fend, or be left acceptable to our 
Common Mafter ? Can we bear the 
being Cenfur'd as Singular and 
Laugh'd at for Fools, rather than 
comply with the evil Cuftorns of 
the Age? and are we much more 
Covetous of the Subftance Vertue, 
than of the Shadow Fame? If it be 
fo we're pretty fure that all is Right, 
and that GOD s will is the Rule, and 
his Glory the End of all our A&ions. 
It goes to a good Womans heart to 
receive that Commendation which 
the good-nature or Civility of ano- 
ther beftows on her, when, flie

Again, whatisfaid ofStibmiflion 
and a perfeft acquiefcence in the 
Divine Will, is not to be Co under- 
ftood as if it were a fault to change 
our Circumftances when we're fair- 
ly and honeftly call'd to't, or that 
we might not feek by honourable 
ways to enlarge them if they fit too 
ftrait. But it is defign'd to corre£fc 
that Complaining humor, which 
makes us always diffatisfied w 7 ith 
the Prelent, and longing after a 
Change; which, how Religious fo- 
ever we wou'd appear, is a very 
fure fign that our PafTions are not 
mortified nor our Will reduced to a 
due Regularity : As hers is without 
doubt who can be pleas'd when 
even her moft innocent Defires are 
denied, when fhe is difappointed in

For fuch an one has nothing in her 
Temper that Seniible Impreflions 
can Co ftrongly faften on, as to dis- 
compofe her Mind; and what can 
fhe meet with to feduct her to Un- 
lawful, who defires not to be her 
own Chufer in Lawful and Indif-

The Laws of GOD have a Natural 
and Inward Goodnefs, which wou'd 
recommend them to a Rational 
Mind tho they were not injoyn'd, 
and therefore no wonder that Tem-

duly regulated pafles over thefe and

that and that alone is able to carry

But we are not fo forward in afpir-

Adverfity are as lovely in them- 
felves, and as Acceptable to GOD as 
thofe of Profpenty, or rather more 
fb, becaufe they exprefs a greater 
Love to GOD, are more oppofite to

eafy Circumftances. But they don't 
make fb great a Figure in the World, 
they don't feed our Vanity Co much, 
nor are fb agreeable to Flefh and 
Bloud, and that's the reafon why we 
care not for them. 

Tis true we profefs that we de- 
fire Riches and Honour, a great Re- 
putation and Theater in the World, 
on no other account but to do GOD 
Service. But if we are real in this, 
why don't we perform fo much as 
we might in our prefent Station ? 
Alas! we Cheat our (elves, as well 
as endeavour to icnpofe on others ; 
and under Pretence cffeekingGOD's 
Glory, in Reality purfue nothing 
but our own. For had we indeed 
that Efteem for GOD and intire 
Conformity to his Will, which is 
at once both the Duty and Perfecti- 
on of all National Beings, we fhou'd 
not complain of his Exercife of that 
Power, which a Prince or even an

which is, to fet his Servants about

gine that it is not Govern'd with the 
Greateft Juftice and Equity, Order 
and Proportion ? Is not every one 
of us plac'd in fuch Circumftances as 
Infinite Wifctom difcerns to be moft 
fuitabie, fo that nothing is wanting 
but a careful obfervation whither 
they lead us, and how we may beft 
improve them? What reafon then 
to complain of the Management of 
the world? and indeed except in the 
Moralsof Mankind which are vifibly

that Education is a beaten Subjeft,

we're really their Friends, whilft 
we ftrive to divorce them from fuch

tend to. And perhaps there is no 
need of Diredions fince few will at- 
tempt to pradife them; for if a Paf- 
fion that is young and tender gives 
us work enough, as the difficulty 
of Education plainly {hews it does, 
they had need be very Kind, very 
Good, and very Wife, who fet a- 
bout the Cure of an Old and inve- 
terate one. Nor can they who have 
ib much Divinity in their Mind 
as to defign fuch a noble work, be 
thought to ftand in need of any ad- 
vice how to perform it. 
However, Tie venture to fay in

Commotion with Commotion, nor

that the Paffion has got an intire

And as to the Influence that ano- 
ther Perfons Paffion may have on 
us, enough has bin laid to warn us, 
not to dally with the Flame when 
our Neighbours houfe is on Fire, left 
we be confuted in it ; and careful- 
ly to avoid doing any thing which 
may excite, or encreafe their Paf- 
fions. But when we difcern that 
the Plague is begun, let's remove 
with all poffible fpeed out of the in- 
fe&ed Air. Great Paflions arife from 
very fmall beginings, and that which 
appear'd Innocent at firft if aliow'd 
on that account, does often become 
our Ruin, or gives us at leaft the 
greateft trouble in overcoming it.

The CO NCLVSION. 

THUS you have Ladies, the 
beft Method I can at pre- 
fent think of for your Improve- 
ment , how well it anfwers my 
Defign the World muft judge. Ifl 
you are to favourable as to think 
it comes up to't in any meafure, 
what remains but to put it in Prac- 
rife, tho in the way in which you 
live, 'tis not probable that all of you 
either Will or Can, for reafons 
mention *d in the firft 
' 72> ' e ' Part, and particularly be- 
caufe of the great wafte of your 
Time,without Redeeming of which 
there's nothing to be done. It is not 
my intention that you fhou'd fe- 
ciude yourfeivc s from the World, I 
know it is neceffary that a great 
number of you (hou'd live in it; but 
it is Unreafonable and Barbarous to 
drive you into't, ere you are capa- 
ble of doing Good in it, or at leaft 

of 



Propofal to the Ladies. 285 

of keeping Evil from your felves. 
Nor am I (0 fond of my Propofal, as 
not to lay it afide very willingly, 
did I think you cou'd be fufficiently 
ferv'd without it. But fince fuch 
Seminaries are thought proper for 
the Men, fince they enjoy the fruits 
ofthofe Noble Ladies Bounty who 
were the foundreffes of feveral of 
their Colleges, why fhou'd we not 
think that fuch ways of Education 
woird be as advantageous to the 
Ladies ? or why fhou'd we defpair 
of finding fome among them who 
will be as kind to their own Sex as 
their Anceftors have been to the 
other ? Some Obje&ions againft this 
defign have already been confi- 
der'd, and thofe w hich I have fince 
met with are either too trifling to 
deferve a ferious Anfwer, or toolll- 
natur'd not to require a feverer than 
I care to give them. They mult 
either be very Ignorant or very Ma- 
licious who pretend that we wou'd 
imitate Foreign Monallries, or ob- 

je£ 



28 6 The Second Part of the 

je£t againft us the lnconveniencies 
that they are fubjeft to ; a little at- 
tention to what they read might 
have convinced them that our Infti- 
tution is rather Academical than Mo- 
naftic. So that it is altogether be- 
fide the purpofe, to fay 'tis tooRe- 
clufe, or prejudicial to an Aftivc 
Life 3 'tis as far from that as a La- 
dys Praftifing at home is from being 
a hindrance to her dancing at Court. 
For an AQive Life confifh not bare- 
ly in Being in the World, but in doing 
much Good in it : And therefore it is 
fit we Retire a little, to furnifh our 
Underftandings with uftful Princi- 
ples, to fet our Inclinations right, 
and to manage our Paffions , and 
when this is well done, but not till 
then, we may fafely venture out. 

As for thofe who think fo Con- 
temptibly of fuch a confiderable part 
of GOD's Creation, as to fuppofe 
that we were made for nothing elfe 
but to Admire and do them Service, 
and to make provifion for the low 

concerns 



Propofal to tbe Ladies. 287 

concerns of an Animal Life, we pi- 
ty their miftake , and can calmly 
bear their Scoffs, for they do not 
exprefs fo much Contempt of us as 
they do of our Maker ; and there- 
fore the reproach offuch incompe- 
tent Judges is not an Injury but an 
Honor to us. 

The Ladies I hope pafs a truer 
eftimate on themfclves, and need- 
not be told that they were made for 
nobler purpofes. For tho I wou'd 
by no means encourage Pride, yet I 
wou'd not have them take a mean 
and groveling Spirit for true Humi- 
lity. A being content with Igno- 
rance is really but a Pretence, for 
the frame of our nature is fuch that 
it is impoffible we fhou'd be fo y 
even thofe very Pretenders value 
themfelves for fome Knowlege or 
other, tho it be a trifling or miftak- 
en one. She who makes the moft 
Grimace at a Woman of Senfe, who 
employs all her little skill in endea- 
vouring jq render Learning and 

Ingenuity 



288 The Second Part of the 

Ingenuity ridiculous , is yet very 
defirous to be thought Knowing in 
a Drefs, in the Management of an 
Intreague , in Coquetry or good 
Houfwifry. If then either the No- 
blenefs or Neceffity of our Nature 
unavoidably excites us to a defire of 
Advancing , fhall it be thought a 
fault to do it by purfuing the beft 
things ? and fince we will value our 
felves on fbmewhat or other, why 
fhou'd it not be on the moft fubftan- 
tial ground ? The Humbleft Perfen 
that lives has fome Self-Efteem, nor 
is it either Fit or Poffible that any 
one flhould be without it. Becaufe 
we always Negleft what we De- 
fpife, we take no care of its Prefer- 
vation and Improvement , and 
were w r e throughly poflefs'd with a 
Contempt of our felves, we fhou'd 
aban Ion all Care both of our Tem- 
poral and Eternal Concerns, and 
burft with Envy at our Neighbours. 
The only difference therefore be- 
tween the Humble and the Proud is 

i this, 



Propojal to the Ladies. 2 8 ^ 

this, that whereas the former does 
not prize her f elf on fbme Imaginary 
Excellency, or for any thing that is 
not truly Valuable; does not aferibe 
to her felf what is her Makers due, 
nor Efteem her felf on any other 
account but becaufe fhe is GOD's 
Workmanfhip , endovv'd by him 
with many excellent Qualities, and 
made capable of Knowing and En- 
joying the Sovereign and Only 
Good; fb that her Self-Efteem does 
not terminate in her Self but in 
GOD, and (he values her felf only 
for GOD's fake. The Proud on the 
contrary is miftaken both in her 
Eftimate of Good, and in thinking 
it is her Own ; She values her felf 
on things that have no real Excel- 
lency, or which at leaft add none 
to her, and forgetsfrom whole Libe* 
rality fhe receives them : She does 
not employ them in the Donors 
Service, all her care is to Raife her 
filf, and fhe little confi Jers that the 
moft excellent things are dirtributed

toothers in an^qual, perhaps in a 
greater meafure than to hcrfelf, they 
have opportunities of advancing as 
well as fhe, and fo long as fhe's puft 
up by this Tumor of Mind, they do 
really excel her. 

The Men therefore may flill enjoy 
theirPrerogatives for us, we mean not 
to intrench on any of their Lawful 
Privileges , our only Contention 
fhall be that they may not out-do us 
in promoting his Glory who is Lord 
both of them and us > And by all 
that appears the generality wiil not 
oppofe us in this matter, we fhall 
not provoke them by driving to be 
better Chriftians. They may bufy 
their Heads with Affairs of State, 
and fpend their Time and Strength 
in recommending themfelves to an 
uncertain Mailer, or a more giddy 
Multitude, our only endeavour 
fhall be to be abfolute Monarchs in 
our own Bofoms. They fhall ftill 
if they pleafe difpute about Religi* 
cn a let 'cm only give us leave to

Underftand and Pra&ife it. And 
vvhilft they have unrival'd theGlory 
of fpeaking as many Languages as 
Babel afforded, we only defire toex- 
prefs our felves Pertinently and Ju- 
dicioufly in One. We will not vie 
with them in thumbing over Au- 
thors, nor pretend to be walking 
Libraries, provided they'll but al- 
low us a competent Knowlege of 
the Books of GOD, Nature I mean 
and the Holy Scriptures : And 
whilft they accomplish themfcives 
with the Knowlege of the World, 
and experiment all the Pleafures 
and Follies of it, we'll afpire no fur- 
ther than to be intimately acquaint- 
ed with our own Hearts. And 
fure the Complaifant and Good na~ 
tur'd Sex will not deny us this ; nor 
can they who are fo welt aflur'd of 
their own Merit entertain the leaft 
Sufpicion that we fhall overtop 
them. It is upon fbme other ac- 
count therefore that they objeft 
againft ourPropofal r but what that 
O 2 is 



2p2 The Second Part of the 

is I (hall not pretend to guefs, fince 
they do not think fit to fpeak out 
and declare it. 

Some indeed are pleas'd to fay, 
that tho this appears in Speculation 
to be a very Happy and Ufeful way 
of. Living, it will be quite another 
thing when reduced toPra&ice. Va- 
riety of Humours will occafion Re- 
fenrments and Faftions, and per- 
haps other inconveniencies not yet 
forefeen ^ nor can we expeft that 
evtry Perfon there will be of fuch 
an agreeable, obliging and teacha- 
ble Temper, as neither to Give nor 
Take Offence. And fuppofing the 
firft Company w T ere as tradable and 
as happily cemented by the mutual 
love of Vertue, and prudent Ma- 
nagement, as we cou'd defire, yet 
how can wc be fecure of their Suc- 
ceffors, or that this as well as other 
good Inftitutions fhall not degene- 
rate f 

I agree fb far with this Obje&ion 
as to grant that our Propofal is not

thing can be faid againft it, but is 
there any thing in this World that 
isfc? Or do Men ufe to quit their 
Employments and Houfes , their 
Wives and Children, Relations and 
Friends, upon every little pet, or 
becaufe they very often find trouble 
or difagreeablenefs ? do they not ra- 
ther if they are good Chriftians, 
bear with Infirmities and endeavour 
to mend them ? Hethenwhowou'd 
Objeft to purpofe muft (hew that 
the Good it may do is not equiva- 
lent to the Evil which may attend

Inconveniencies with, than without

berty to believe that it is Humor, 
Covetoufnefs or any thing rather 
than Reafon which 'reftrains him

to feed it by fcrupling and object-

who perhaps has not over-look'd 
thofc fine difcoveries in which he 
hugs himfett , but having view'd 
them on all fides has difcern'd and 
defpis'd their infignificancy. I 
wou'd only ask our Objeftors whe- 
ther they think the World fo good 
as that it needs none, or fo bad as 
that it is not capable of Amend- 
ment ? If neither of thefe, let them 
tell me whether Complaining and 
Wifhing will ever do the bufinefs, 
or who is the greateft Benefa&or to 
Mankind, he who finds fault with 
every ProjeQ: feton foot to better 
and improve them, beeaufe it is not 
exactly after the Pattern in the 
Mount, that is indeed according to 
his own tooth and relifh ; it is not 
beyond exception,but has a touch of 
Humane Weaknefs and Ignorance 
mingled with it ? Or he who vigo-

heart and a diligent hand, fets about 
doing what he Can , tho not fo 
much as he Wou'd, were his abi- 
lities greater? We're all apt enough 
to cry out againft the Age, but to 
what purpofe are our Exclamations 
unlefs we go about to Reform it > 
Not faintly and coldly as if we were 
unconcern'd for the fiiccefs, and on- 
ly wouM do fbmewhat to (till the 
reproaches of our Conferences and 
to exalt us in our ownlmaginations, 
with the Pompous Idea of Zeal and 
Public Spiritednefs ; but with all our 
Might, with an Unwearied Indu- 
ftry and Vigor, I'me afham'd to fay 
like that which the Inrtruments of 
Satan exprefs in making Profelv tes 
to Wickednefs and Prophineneis ; 
but rather with fuch as becomes the 
Servants of Chrift, which bears 
fomefort of proportion to the Great* 
nefsof ourMafter, the Importance 
of the Work and the Excellency of 
the Reward* 

We

We do not expeft that all who 
come into this Society will be per- 
fect, but we will endeavour to 
make them and our felves fo as 
much as may be. Nor (hall any be 
admitted who either have not, or 
are not defirous to have, that Di- 
vine yet humble, that Grest and 
Generous, yet Meek and Condef 
cending Spirit, that unfeigned Love 
to GOD and all Mankind which 
was in Chrift Jefus. We fet no 
other Rules than thofe of the Go- 
fpel, Chriftianity being the higheft 
Improvement of a Rational Nature, 
and every one's oblig'd to keep its 
Institutions whether they Live in 
fueh a Society or out of it. 

And as for that degeneracy which 
it may fall into, 'tis too general an 
obje&ion to have any weight, and 
'may as well be urge! againft Univer- 
sities, all forts of Government, and 
indeed againft every thing, as 
againft this. May he's and ifs are 
^ndlefs, and he who undertakes to 

provide 



Propofa! to the Ladies. 2gJ 

provide againit all Future Contin- 
gencies, either believes no GOD 
or fancies himfelf to be one. A 
Prudent Man will look as far as 
he can, and provide to the ut- 
moft of his Knowlege and Pow- 
er, but when that's done, he 
knows he's but a Man and there- 
fore can't poflibly Forfeeand Reme- 
dy all rhings. 

Let's then do what we C*#, and 
leave the reft to our Great Bene- 
faftor and Governor, but let us fet 
about our own part, not only when 
the way is open and eafy , who 
fhall give us thanks for that ? but in 
fpite of all Difficulties and Difc 
couragement, fince we have fb Glo- 
rious a Leader, fo indefatigable in 
his Labours, fo boundleis in his 
Love, fuch an Omnipotent Aflifter 
who neither \\ ants Power nor Will

Obftinacy of fuch as Quarrel with 
our Labour of Love and fet them-

felves againft all we can do to ferve 
them, will only add to our Laurels
