THE SOVIETS AT WORIC 

The Problems of the Soviet Government. 



\ 



Thanks to the peace obtained — in spite of its oppressive- 
ness and all its insecurity — the Russian Soviet Republic is 
enabled for a certain time to concentrate its efforts on the 
most important and most difficult side of the Socialist revo- 
lution, viz. : on the problem of organization. 

This problem is presented clearly and precisely to all toil- 
ing and oppressed masses in the fourth section of the ^reso- 
lution adopted at the extraordinary Congress of the Soviets 
held at Moscow on March i6, 1916, the section which urges 
self-discipline of the workers and a merciless struggle 
against chaos and disorganization. 

The insecurity of the peace obtained by the Russian Soviet 
Republic is determined, of course, not by the fact that it 
was now considering the renewal of military activity. With 
the exception of the bourgeois counter-revolutionists and 
their aids (the Mensheviks, etc.) no sensible statesman 
thinks of that. The insecurity of the peace is determined 
by the fact that in the imperialistic nations bordering on the 
West and on the East of Russia and possessing enormous 
military power, the upper hand may at any moment be 
gained by the military party, which is tempted by the tem- 
porary weakness of Russia and incited by the anti-Socialist 
capitalists. 

Under such conditions our real, and not assumed, guaranty 
of peace lies exclusively in the antagonisms among the vari- 
ous great powers. It is obvious that, in view of the weak- 
ness of such guaranty, our Socialist Soviet Republic is in an 
extremely precarious, undoubtedly critical international posi- 
tion. We must strain all our strength in order to utilize the

« 

lation. And they accomplished this task, in spite of the 
resistance of the workers and the poorest peasants, with 
comparative ease, not only because the resistance of tlie ex- 
ploited masses was then, on account of their unorganized 
state and their ignorance, extremely weak, but also because 
the fundamental organizing force of the anarchical ly built 
capitalistic society is provided by the natural, extensive and 
intensive growth of the national and international market. 

In .every Soi:ialist revolution, however, the main task of 
the proletariat, and of the poorest peasantry led by it — 
and, hence, also in the Socialist revolution in Russia in- 
augurated by us on IJovember 7, 1917^ — consists in the posi- 
tive and constructive work of establishing an extremely 
complex and' delicate net of newly organized relationships 
covering the systematic production and distribution of 
..products which are necessary for the existence of tens of 
millions of people. The successful realization of such a 
revolution depends on the original historical creative work 
of the majority of the population, and first of all of the 
majority of the toilers. The victory of the Socialist revo- 
lution will not be assured, unless the proletariat and the 
.poorest p^^antry manifests sufficient consciousness, idealism, 
.^elf-sacrifice and persistence. With the creation of a new — 
the Soviet — type of -state, offering to the oppressed toiling 
.^.masses the opportunity to participate actively in the free 
construction of a new society, we have solved only a small 
rpart of the difficult task. The main difficult is in the eco- 
ncHnic domain ; to .raise the productivity of labor, to estab- 
lish .strict and universal accounting and control of produc- 
tion and. distribution, .and^ac/waWy to socialise praduction.

The 'Bvolution of Bolshevism. 

The evolution of the Bolshevik party, which is today the 



, 2 N.ovenil?er 7, 1917, is the date of the successful Bolshevik coup 
d'etat. The Kereniky coalition government was forced to abdicate 
on t^ day- and the Soviet government instituted in its place, with 
the Bolshevik leaders, .Nikolai Lenin and Leon Trotsky, at ^he helm. 




SOVIET GOVERNMENT. 7 

one hand, and the Mensheviks^ and right Social-Revolu- 
tionists^— who echo and follow them — on the other hand, 
continue their attempts to unite for the overthrow of the 
Soviet power. But, in the main, the problem oT the resis- 
tance of the exploiters was already solved in the period be- 
tween November 7, 1917, and (approximately) February, 
1918 — the time of the surrender of BogajevskyJ 

The Problems of Management. 

We are now confronted by the third problem, which is 
the most urgent and which characterizes the present period — 

5 The Mensheviks are the moderate wing of the Russian Social- 
Democratic Labor Party, and have always opposed the Bolsheviks on 
questions of tactics. The war and the Revolution have made the gulf 
which separated them still wider, though both elements considered 
themselves as belonging to one Marxian Socialist movement. Since 
the beginning of the war the Mensheviks themselves were split into 
two factions, the one IckI by George V. Plechanov, which was nation- 
alist, and the other led by Martov, which was internationalist. Dur- 
ing the first eight months of the Revolution (March-November), the 
Mensheviks were in control of the Soviets, while the Bolsheviks" 
were the oppositon, demanding the break of the Mensheviks with 
the bourgeois parties. It was this policy that finally led to the victory 
of the Bolsheviks over th^ Mensheviks in the Soviet. 

^ The Party of Socialists-Revolutionists was the other Socialist 
party in Russia. It represented the non-Marxian Socialist move- 
ment. While the Social-Democrats were primarily active among 
the city workers, the Socialists-Revolutionists interested themselves 
in the agrarian problem and spread their organization among the 
peasants. With this party was also connected the Terroist group, 
which was responsible for the various assassinations under the old 
regime. Alike with the Social-Democrats the war and the Revolu- 
tion have brought about a split among the Socialists-Revolutionists. 
Corresponding to the Plechanov group among the Social-Democrats, 
were the elements among the Socialists-Revolutionists, led by Mme. 
Breshko-Breskovsky, known as Babushka (little mother), who sup- 
ported" Kerensky, also a member of this party. The moderate In- 
ternationalist group led by Victor Tchernov, formed the center and 
the radical elements led by Spiridonova formed the left wing. 

■^ Reference is here made to the surrender of the leader of the 
Don Cossacks during one of the counter-revolutiona;"y attempts 
in the region under General Kaledine, the Hetman of the Don 
Cossacks.

now offering such resistence). Dutov and Bogajevsky^ Mili- 
tary resistance can. be crushed only by military means, and 
the Red Guards were contributing to the noblest and great- 
est historical cause, the cause of emancipation of the ex- 
ploited toilers from the oppression qf the e:jcploiters. 

Secondly, we could not then give preeminence to the 
method of management instead of the methods of suppres- 
sion also because the art of management is not inherent in 
people, but is gained through experience. At that time we 
did not have this experience. We have it now ! 

Thirdly, then we could not have at our disposal specialists 
6£ different branches, of knowledge and technique, for they 
were either fighting in the ranks of the Bogajevskys, or 
were still in a position to offer systematic and persistent pas- 
sive resistance through sabQtage. 

Does this me^n that the "Red Guard" attack on Capital 
is the right itIfetHo.d always wd In all circumstances, and 
that w,e have no otlier n^ethods of combating capitalism ? To 
think ^0 would be toQ naive. We have won with light 
cavalry, but we also have h^avy artillery at our disposal. 
We have been winning by methods of suppression. We 
will, be «tble tQ wiQ also by methods of management. We 
should l^ ahle tQ change the methods of fighting with th^ 
charge of circumstances. We dp not for a moment reject 
tlie '^Red Guard'* suppression qf the Savinkovs and Gegech- 
koris as well as of any other bourgeois counter-revolutionist. 
But we will not t^e as stupid as tQ give preeminence tq the 

*%tA Qi^r4" methods.

victoriously), it ia becoming; urgent for the proletarian state

SOVIET GOVERNMENT. I5 

who are acquainted with the facts understand this, but not 
all give sufficient thought to the significance of sHch a 
measure on the part of the p/oletarian state. It is clear that 
such a measure is a compromise, that it is a defection from 
the principles of the Paris Commune and of any proletarian 
rule, which demand the reduction of salaries to the standard 
of remuneration of the average workers — principles which 
demand that "career hunting'' be fought by deed, not by 
words. 

Furthermore, it is clear that such a measure is not merely 
a halt in a certain part and to a certain degree of the offen- 
sive against capitalism (for capitalism is not a quantity ofi 
money but a definite social relationship), but also a step 
backzvard by our Socialist Soviet state which has from the 
very beginning proclaimed and. carried on a policy of re- 
ducing high salaries to the standard of wages of the aver- 
age worker. 

Of course, the servants of the bourgeoisie, particularly of 
the petty kind. Tike tiie Mensheviks and the right Social- 
Rcvotetio»ists, will sneer at our admission that we are mak- 
ing a 6:tep buckwdrd. But we should pay no attention to 
aieering. We must study the pecularities of the highly 
d^lkult and new road to Socialism without concealing our 
mistakes and weaknesses. We must try to overcome our 
deficietftries in time. To conceal from the masses that at- 
tracting 'bourgeois specialists by extremely high salaries is 
a defection from the principles of the Commune, would 
^ mean that we had lowered ourselves to the level of bour- 
beois politicians who ruled by practicing deception. To ex- 
plain openly how and why Wt have made a step backward 
and then to discuss publicly ways and means to overcome 
our defficiencies, is to educate the masses and to learn from 
experience, to karn together with them how to build So- 
[^ cialism. There has hardly been a single victorious military 
campaign in history in which the victor has not made in- 
dividual mistakes, suffered partial defeats, and temporarily 
retreated at some time. And the "campaign" against capi-
