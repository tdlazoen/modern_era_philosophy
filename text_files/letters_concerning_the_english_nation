THE 

PREFACE. 

THE preicnt work appears with 
confiacnce in the kingdom that 
gave birth to it : and will be well fatis- 
fied with its fortune, if it meets with 
as favourable a reception as has been 
indulged to all the other compofitions 
of its author. The high efteem which 
Mr. de Voltaire has always difcovered 
for the Englijhi is a Proof how ambi- ' 
tious he is of their approbation. . It is 
now grown familiar to him, but then 
he is not tired with it ; and indeed one 
Would be apt to think that this circum- 
A a ftancc 



rv PRE F-^fE. 

fiance is plcafing to the nation, from 
the ftrong defire they have to perufe 
whoever is publiihed under his name. 

Without pretending therefore to 
any great penetration, we may venture 
to affure him that his letters will meet 
with all the fuccefs that could be wifh- 
ed, Mr. iie VUtaire is the author of 
them, they were written in London^ 
and relate particularly to the J^ngl^ 
nation ; three circumftances which 
muft necefTarily recommend them* 
The great freedom with which Mr* 
de Voltaire delivers himfelf in his var 
rious obfervations, cannot give hinx 
any Apprehcnfions of their being lefs 
favourably received upon that account, 
by a judicious people who abhor flat- 
tery • The EngliJIj are pleafed to have 
their faults pointed out to them, be- 
cawfe this (hews at the fame tim?, that 

the

the writer is able to diftinguiflb dieir 
merit. :? 

We muft however confefs^ that* 
thefe letters were not defigned for the 
public. They are the refult of the 
author's complacency and Friendfliip 
for Mr, ^hiriot^ who had defired him^ 
during Ris ftay in England^ to favour 
him^with fuch remarks as he might 
make on the manners and cuftoms of 
the Britijh nation^ *Ti& well known 
that in a correfpondence of this kind^ 
the moft juft and regular writer does 
not propofe to obferve any method. 
Mr. de Voltaire in all probability fol- 
lowed no other rule in the choice of 
his fubjefts than his particular tafle,.or 
perhaps the queries of his friend. Be 
this as it willy 'twas thought that the 
moft natural order in which they could 
be placed, would be that of their rc- 
A 3 fpeftivc 



ri p R E F A c e: 

Tj>eaive dates. Several particuiart 
which are mentioned in them make it 
neceflary for us to obferve^ that they 
were .written between the latter end of 
172^, and about 1731^. The only thing 
tjiat can be .regretted on this occafion 
15, that fo agreeable a correlpondence 
fliould have continued no longer. 

The reader will no doubt obfervcy* 
that the circumftanceS' in every letter 
yi^hich had not an immediate relation 
to the title of it, have been omitted. 
This was done on purpofe ; for let- 
ters written with the confidence and' 
fimplicity of perfonal friendfhip, gene- 
pally include certain things which are 
not proper for the prefs. The public 
indeed thereby often lofe a great ma- 
ny agreeable particulars ^ but why 
fliould they complain,, if file want of 

them 



•fliem is compcnfated by a thousand 
Beauties of another kind ? The variety 

' ©f the fubjefts, the graces of the dic- 
tion, the folidity of<the refledions^ the 

'delicate turn of the criticifm; in fine, 
the noble fire,, which enlivens all tha 

■ compofitions of Mr. Je Foftaire, de- 
light the reader perpetually. Even 
the moft ferious letters, fuch as thofe: 
which relate to Sir Ifaac Newton's 
philofophy, will be found entertaining. 
The apthor has infufed into his fubjedt 
all the delicate touches it was fufcep- 

^tlble of; ^eep and abftrufe enough to 
£hew that he was mafter of it, and al- 
ways peripicuous. enough to be under- 
llood. 

Some pf his Englip readers may 
perhaps be diflatisficd at his not ex- 
patiating farther on .their conftitution 

and 



viii PR )B FACE., 

and their laws, which mod of thefiir 
revere almoft to idolatry ; but this re- 
fcrvednefs is an effect of Mr, de VoJ- 
tatr's judgment. He contented him- 
felf with giving Hfs opinion of thtm. 
in general' reflections^ tlie caft of which 
is entirely new, and which prove that 
he had made this part of the .Briti/h 
polity his particular ftudy. Befides, 
how was it poflible for a foreigner to 
pierce through their politicks, that 
gloomy labyrinth,, in which fuch of 
the Englijh themfelves as are beft ac- 
quainted witli it, confefs daily that 
they are bewildered and loft I 

While this work was in theprefi,

I Was of opinion, that the dodrine and 
hiftory of fo extraordinary a People, 
were worthy the- attention of the cu- 
rious. To acquaint myfelf with them, I 
made a vifit to one of the mod eminent 
Quakers in England^ who after having 
traded,xhirty years had the wifdom to pre- 
fcrlSe limits to his fortune and to his de- 
fires, and was fettled in a little folitude not 
far from London. Being come into it, I 
perceiv'd a fmall, but regularly built houfe, 
vaftly neat, but without the lead pomp o(

was a hale ruddy complcxion'd old man, 
who had never bee nji^fflidtedj yith fickncfs^ 
becaufe he had' al^^ys been infenRble to 
paffions, and, a^ert^;^faja^ intern- 
vpcrance. I never in my lift Yaw^ a more 
noblel)r a more engaging afpeft than his. 
He was drefs*d like thofe of his perfuafion, 
in a plain coat, without plaits in the fides, 
or buttons on the pockets and fleeves ; and 
had on a beaver, the brims of which were 
horizontal, like thofe of our clergy. He 
did not uncover himfelf when I appeared, 
and advanced towards me without once 
(looping his body ; but there appeared mfore 
politenefs in the open, humane air of his 
countenance, than in the cuftom of draw- 
ing one leg behind the other, and taking 
that from the head, which is made to co- 
ver it. Friend, fays he to me, I perceive 
thou art a ftranger, but if I can do any 
thing for thee, only tell me. Sir, fays I 
to him, bending forwards, and advancing 
»s is ufual with us, one leg towards him, 
I flatter myfelf that my juft curiofity will 
not give you the leaft oflFcnce, and that 
you'll do me the honour to inform me of 
the particulars of your religion. The peo- 
ple of thy countiy, replied the Quaker, 
are too full of their bows and compliments, 
but I never yet met with one of t-hcm who

condniied to make fome very unfeafonablc 
ceremonies, it not being eafy to difcngage 
onc^s felf at once from habits we have 
been long us'd to ; and after taking part of 
a frugal meal, which began and ended with 
a prayer to God, I began to qucftion my 
courteous ho(V. I open'd with that which 
good Catholicks have more than once made <^ 
to Huguenots. My dear fir, fays I, were \ ^^

fays I to him, you are not Chriftians then. ) 
Frieiid, replies the old man in a foft tone 
of voice, fwear not ; we are Chriftians, and 
endeavour to be good Chriftians, but we 
are not of opinion, that the fprinkling wa- 
ter on a child's head makes him a Chri- 
ftian. Heavens ! fays I, fliock*d at his 
impiety, you have then forgot that Chriji 
was baptizM by St. John. Friend, replies 
the mild Quaker once again, fwear not. 
Chrijt indeed was baptized by Jobn^ but 
he himfelf never baptiz'd any one. We 
are the difciples of Chriji, not of John. I 
pitied very much the fincerity of my wor- 
thy Quaker, and was abfolutely for forcing 
him to get himfelf chriftened. Were that 
all, replied he very gravely, we would 
fubmit chearfully to baptifm, purely in 
compliance with thy weakneis, for we do 
not condemn any perfon who ufes it -, but

that of Chrifty ought to abftain to the ut- 
moft of their power from the Jewijh cere-

baptifm a Jewijh ceremony ? Yes, my 
friend, fays he, fo truly Jewijh^ that a 
great many Jews ufe the baptifm of John 
to this day. Look into ancient authors, 
and thou wilt find that John only revived 
this pradtice ; and that it had been us*d by 
the Hebrews^ lo;ig before his time, in like 
manner as the Mahometans imitated the 
JJhmaelites in their pilgrimages to Mecca. 
Jefus indeed fubmitted to the baptifm of 
John^ as he had fuffered himfclf to be 
circumcised ; but circumcifion and the 
wafhing with water ougfit to be abolifh'd

is the falvation of mankind, thus the fore-

perfons with water, and that very much a- 
gainft his inclinations. He circumcis'd his 
difciple TimothyT, and the other dilciples 
likewife circumcis'd all who were willing 
to fubmit to that carnal ordinance. But 
art thou circumcised, added he ? I have 
not the honour to be fo, fays I. Well, 
friend, continues the Quaker, thou art a 
Chriftian without being circumcised, and I 
am one without being baptiz'd. Thus did. 
this pious man make a wrong, but very 
Ipecious application, of four or five texts 
of fcriptue which feem'd to favour the^ 
tenets of his feft -, but at the fame time 
forgot verylincerely an hundred texts which 
made diredtly againft them. I had more 
fenfe than to conteft with him, fince there 
is no poflibility of convincing an enthufiaft. 
A man (hou'd never pretend to inform a 
lover of his miftrefs's faults, no more than 
one who is at law, of the badnefs of his 
caufe ; nor attempt to win over a fanatic 
by ftrength of reafoning. Accordingly I 
wav'd the fubjeit. 

Well, fays I to him, what fort of a 
communion have you ? We have none like 
that thou hinteft at among us, replied he. 
How ! no comm union, fays I ? Only that 
fpiritual one, replied he, of hearts. ^ He 
then began again to throw out his texts of

ranged in a tone as tho* he had been in- 
ipir'd, to prove that the facraments were 
liierely of human invention, and that the 
word facrament was not once mentioned in 
the gofpel. Excufe, fays he, my igno* 
ranee, for I have not employed an hundredth 
part of the arguments which might be 
brought, to prove the truth of our religion, 
but thefe thou thyfelf mayeft perufe in the 
Expofition of our Faith written by Robert 
Barclay. 'Tis one of the beft pieces that 
ever was penn'd by man ; and as our ad- 
verfaries confefs it to be of dangerous ten- 
dency, the arguments in it muft neceflarily 
be very convincing. I promised to perufe 
this pidce, and my. Quaker imagined he 
had abfeady made a convert of me. He 
afterwards gave me an account in few 
words, of fome fingularities which niake 
this fed the contempt of others. Coirfefs, 
fay§ he, that it was very difficult for thee to 
refrain from laughter, when I ajifwerM all 
thy civilities without uncovering my head, 
and at the fame time faid Thee and Thou to 
thee. However, thou appeareft to me too 
well read, not to know that in Chrift^s 
time no nation was fo ridiculous as to put 
the plural number for the fingular. Ju- 
gufius Cafar himfelf was fpoke to in fuch 
phrafes as thefe. Hove thee^ Ibefeecb thee^ 
I thank thee -, but he did not allow any per-

which mere worms beftow on other worms,

SUCH was the fubftance of the con- 
verfation I had with this very Angular . 
perfon j but I was greatly furpriz'd to fee 
him come the Sunday following, and take 
me with him to the Quakers meeting. 
There are feveral. of thefe in London^ but 
that which he carried me to ftands near the 
famous pillar cairdjjie^ Monument. The ^ 
brethren were already affembled at my en- 
tering it with my guide. There might be 
about four hundred men and three hundred 
women in the meeting. The women hid 
their faces behind their fans, and the men 
were covered with their broad-brim*d^ 
hats ; all were feated, and the filence was 
univerfal. I paft through them, but did 
not perceive fo much as one lift up his eyes 
to look at me. This filence lafted a quar- 
ter of an hour, when at laft one of them 
rofe up, took off his Hat, and after mak- 
ing a variety of- wry faces, and groaning in 
amoft lamentable manner, he partly frorni

his nofe, and partly from his mouth, threw 
out a ftrange, confus'd jumble of words, 
(borrowed as he imagined from the Gofpel) 
which neither KimfeTf nor any of his hear- 
ers underftood. When this diftorter had 
ended his beautiful fbliloquy, and that the 
.ftupid, but greatly edified, congregation 
were feparated, I alk'd my friend how it 
was poffible for the judicious part of their 
aflembly to fuffer fuch a babbling. We 
are oWig'd, fays he, to fuffer it, oecaufe 
no one knows when a man rifes up to hold 
forth, whether he will be mov*d by the 
fpirit or by folly. In this doubt ahd un- 
certainty we liften patiently to every one, 
we even allow our women to hold forth-; 
two or three of thefe are often infpired at 

r one and the fame time, and *tis then that 
a moft charming noife is heard in the Lord's 
houfe. You have then no priefts, fays I 
to him. Noy no, friend, replies the Qua- 
ker, to our great happinefs. Then open- 
ing one of the friends books, as he caird 
it, he read the following words in an em- 
phatic tone : God forbid we fl>ould pre- 
fume to ordain any one to receive the Holy 
Spirit on the Lord's day, to the prejudice 

"of the reft of the brethren. Thanks to

Holy Ghoft, and make of an affembly of 
Chriftians a mere (hop of traders ? We da 
not pay a fet of men clothed in black, to 
affift our poor, to bury our dead, or to 
preach to the brethren j thefe offices are 
all of too tender a nature, for us ever to 
entruft them to others. But how is it pof- 
fible for you, fays I, with fome warmth, 
to know whether yotir difcourfe is really 
infpir'd by the Almighty ? Whgfoever, fays 
he, fhall implore C;fcxi/J to enlighten him, 
and fhall* pubfiffi the Gofpel truths, he 
may feel inwardly, fuch an one may be 
affur'd that he is infpir'd by the Lord. 
He then pour*d forth a numberlefs multi- 
tude of Scripture-texts, which prov'd, as 
he imagined, that there is no fuch thing as 
Chriftianity without an immediate revela- 
tion, and added thefe remarkable words : 
When thou move ftone of thy limbs, is* it 
mov'd by thy own power ^ Certainly not,, 
for this limb is often fenlible to involuntary

thy body, gives motion to this earthly ta-

fmce thefe pour in upon thy mind whether

thy foul : But as he leaves thy affeftions 
at full liberty, he gives thy mind fuch 
ideas as thy affeftions may deferve ; if thou 
liveft in God, thou afteft, thou thinkeft in 
God. After this thou needeft only but open 
thine eyes to that light which enlightens all 
mankind, and 'tis then thou wilt perceive 
the truth, and make others perceive it. 
Why this, fays I, is Malebranche*s doc- 
trine to a tittle. I am acquainted with thy 
Malebranche^ fays he; he had fomething 
of xht friend in him, but was not enough 
fo. Thefe are the moft confiderable par-

YOU have already heard that the 
Quakers date from Chrift^ who ac- 
cording to them was the firft Quaker. 
Religion, fay thefe, was corrupted, a

William Pen inherited very lar^e

(falfely fo call'd) charm'd with the mild 
and gentle difpofition of their neighbours, 
'came in crowds to William Pen^ and be- 
fought him to admit them into the number 
of his vafTals. 'Twas very rare and un-

this'occafion agreed with .his inclinations.' 
He was defirous of pleafmg the Quakers, 
by annulling the laws made againft Non-

and aukward air contraSed by them at the

men of this country have with the ladies, 
commonly oblige a bifhop to confine him-

thus : Know that there are two ways by 
which men may be wanting in refped to

but this Gentleman, fbfar from being dif-

their governments. TJKere is in London 2l 
Senate, fome of the members whereof are

ing their voices on certain occafions, as 
was done in Rome -, this is the only refem- 
blance. Befides, the two nations appear 
to me quite oppofite in charafter, with re- 
g;ird t>oth to good and evil. The Romans

never knew the dreadful folly of religious 
Wars, an abomination referv*d for devout 
preachers of patience and humility. Ma- 
rius and Sylla^ Cafar and Pompey^ Antbo^

and fet the world in a blaze, merely to 
determine whether the Flamen fliould wear 
his fhirt over his robe, or his robe over 
his (hirt; or whether the facred Chickens 
fhould eat and drink, or eat only, in or- 
der to take the augury. The Englijh 
have hangM one another by law, and cut 
one another to pieces in pitched battles, iot 
quarrels of as trifling a nature. The St6is 
of the Epifcoparians and Prefbyterians 
quite diflrafted thefe very ferious Heads 
for a time. But I fancy they'll hardly ever 
be io filly again, they feeming to be growi^ 
wifer at their own expence ; and I doa*6 
perceive the leafl: inclination in them to 
murther one another merely about fyllo- 
gifms, as fome Zealots among them once 
did. 

But here follows a more effential difle-^ 
' rence between Rome and England^ which 
gives the advantage entirely to the latter^ 
viz. that the civil wars of Rome ended in 
flavery, and thofe of the Englijh in liberty.

na Vaffals •, and where the People fliare in 
the government without confiifion. 

The houfe of Lords and that of the 
Commons divide the Icgiflativepower under 
the King ; but tht Romans had no fuch ba- 
lance. The Patricians and Plebeians in Rome 
were perpetually at variance, and there was 
no intermediate Power to reconcile them. 
The Roman Senate, who were fo unjuftly, 
fo criminally proud, as not to fuffer the 
Plebeians to (hare withr them in any thing,, 
cou'dfind no other artifice to keep the lat- 
ter out of the Adminiftration, than by emr 
ploying them in foreign wars. They con- 
fider'd the Plebeians as a wildbeaft, whom^ 
it bchov*d them to let loofe upon their 
neighbours, for fear they Ihbuld devour 
their matters. Thus the greateft defeat 
in the Government of the Romans raised 
them to be Conquerors. By being unhap- 
py at home, they triumphed over, and 
poflefs^d themfclves of the world, till at 
laft their divifions funk them to ftavery. 

Th£ government oi Et^hnd will never

did this to prevent their nofturnal meet-

more completelyenflav'd. The Chiefs of

Mafter, was trampled upon by an hun-

been the fate of the Gauls^ the Germans^

Article, that thefe pretended Freemen 
ow'd fcrvice to their Lords. Such a Li- 
berty as this was not many removes from 
Slavery. 

By article XXI, the King ordains that 
his Officers fhall not henceforward feize 
upon, unlefs they pay for them, the Hor- 
ks and Carts of Freemen. The people 
confider'd this ordinance as a real liberty, 
tho* it was a greater tyranny. Henry the 
feventh, that happy ufurper and great po- 
litician, who pretended to lore the Barons, 
tho* he in reality hated and feared them, 
got their lands alienated. By this means 
the Villains^ afterwards acquiring riches by 
their induftry, purchas'd the eftates and 
country-feats of the illuftrious Peers, who 
had ruinM themfelves by their folly and 
extravagance, and all the lands got by in- 
fenfible degrees into other hands. 

The Power of the Houfeof Commons 
increas'd every day. The families of the 
ancient Peers were at laft extimft ; and as 
Peers only are properly noble in England^ 
there would be no fuch thing in ftriftnefs 
of law, as nobility in that Ifland, had not 
the Kings created new Barons from time to

INOCULATION. 

IT IS inadvertently affirmed in the Chri- 
ftian Countries of Europe^ that the En- 
glip are Fools and Madmen. Fools, be- 
caufe they give their Children the Small- 
pox to prevent their catching it ; and Mad- 
inen^ becaufe they wantonly communicate 
^ certain and <treadful Diftemper to their 
Children, merely to prevent an uncertain 
evil. The Englijh^ on the other fide, call the 
re(i of the Europecms cowardly and unna- 
tural. Cowardly, becaufe they are afraid 
of putting their Children to a little Pain ; 
unnatural, becaufe they expofe them to die 
' one time or other of the Small-pox, But 
that the reader may be able to judge, whe- 
ther the £;;^///!??, or thofe who differ from 
them in opinion, are in the right, here fol- 
lows the Hiftory of thefam'd Inoculation, 
which is mentioned with fo much dread in 
France. 

Th5 



the English Nation. 6i 

The CircOfffian women have, from time 
immemorial, communicated the Small-pox 
to theirchildren^whcn not above fix months 
old, by making an incifion in the arm ; 
and by putting into this incifion a puflJe, 
taken carefully from the body of another 
child, this puftle produces the fame efFeft 
in the arm it is laid in, as yeft in a piece of 
dough : It ferments, and diflfbfes through 
the whole mafs of blood, the qualities with 
which it is impregnated. The puftles of 
the child, in whom the artificial Small-pox 
has been thus inoculated, are employed to 
communicate the fame difl:emper toothers. 
There is an almofl: perpetual circulation of 
it in * Circ^ffta ; and when unhappily the 
Small-pox has quite left the country, the 
inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and 
perplexity, as other nations when their har- 
vcft has fallen fhort. 

The circumfl:aace that introduced a cu- 
ftom in Grcaffia^ which appears fo Angular 
to others, is ncverthclefs a caufe common 
to all nations, I mean maternal tendemels 
and intercft. 

The Circaffianf are poor, and their 
daughters are beautiful \ and indeed 'tis in 
them they chiefly trade. They furni(h with 
beauties the Seraglios of the T^ar^^^/j^ul tan, 
of the IPerfian Sophy, and of all thofe who 
are wealthy enough to purchafe and main- 
tain iiich precious merchandize. Thefe

maidens are very honourably and virtuous-

taught dances of a very polite and effemi- 
nate kind-, and how to heighten, by the 
moft voluptuous artifices, the jdeafures of 
their difdainful mafters for whom they arc 
defign'd. Thefe unhappy creatures repeat 
their leffon to their mothers, in the lame 
manner as little girls among us repeat their 
catechifm, without underftandirig one word 
they fay. 

. Now it often happened, that after a fa- 
ther and mother had taken the utmoft care 
of the education of their children, they 
were fruftrated of all their hopes in an in- 
ftant. The Small-pox getting into the fa- 
mily, one daughter died of it, another loft 
an eye, a third had a great nofe at her re- 
covery, and the unhappy parents were 
completely ruin'd. Even frequently, when

twee fo as to prove fatal ; in a word, that 
no one ever had it in a violent degree twice 
in his life. They obferv'd farther, that 
when the Small-poy is of the milder fort, 
and the puftles have only a tender, delicate 
ikin to break thro', they never leave the leaft 
fear in the face. From thefe natural ob- 
fervations they concluded, that in cafe an 
infant of fix months, or a year old, (hould 
have a milder Sort of Small-pox, he wouy 
not die of it, wou'd notbemark'd, nor be 
ever afHifted with it again. 

In order therefore to preferve the life 
and beauty of their children, the only 
thing remaining was, to give them the 
Small-pox in their infant years. This they 
did, by inoculating, in the body of a child, 
a puftle taken from the moft regular, and 
at the fame time the moft favourable fort <rf 
Small-pox that could be procured.

xipon their being.wean'd. 

Some pretend, that the Circaffians bor-

bians \ but we ftiall leave the clearing up of 
this point of hiftory to fome learned Bene-

was ambafTador at the Porte^ made no 
fcruple to communicate the Small-pox to an 
infant of which fhe was deliver*d in Con^ 
Jlantinople. The chaplain reprcfented to 
his lady, but to no purpofe, that this was 
an unchriftian operation, and therefore 
that it could fucceed with none but infidels. 
However, it had the moft happy effeft up- 
on the fqn of the lady Wortley MountaguCy

fav'd them from the gallows, but, by 
-means of this artificial Small-pox, prevent- 
ed their ever having that diftemper in a 
natui:^l way, with which they would very 
probably have been attacked one time or 
other, and might have died of in a more 
advanced age. 

The princels being aflured of the u(e- 
fulnefs of this operation, caused her own 
children to be inoculated. A great part of 
ihc kingdom foUow'd her example, and 
fince that time ten thoufand children, at 
leaft, of per^bns of condition, owe in this 
manner theiriives to her maje(ly, and to the 
lady fVortley Mountague ; and as many of 
the fair fex arc obliged to them for their 
beauty. 

Upon a general calculation, threefcore 
perfons in every hundred have the Small- 
pox. Of thefe threefcore, twenty die of 
Jtin the moft favourable feafon of life,^and 
as many more wear the difagreeable re-

no one is disfigur'd, no one has the Small-

Since

Since therefore you defire me to give 
you an accoupt of the famous perfonages 
which England has given birth to,^ I Ihall 
begin with Lord Bacon^ Mr. Lnke^ Sir 
Ifaac Newton^ &c. afterwards the warriors 
and minifters of ftate fhall come in their 
order. 

I. MUST begin with the celebrated vif- 
couht Verulam^ known in Europe by the* 
name of Bacon, which was that of his fa- 
mily. His father had been lord keeper, 
and himfelf was a great many years lord 
chancellor under king James the firft. Ne- 
verthelefs, amidft the intrigues of a court, 
and the affairs of his exalted employment, 
which alone were enough to engrofs his 
whole time, he yet found fo much leifure 
for ftudy, as^tomake himfelf a great phi- 
lofopher, a good hiftorian, and an elegant 
writer -, and a ftill more furprifing circum- 
ftance is, that heliv'd in an age in which 
the art of writing juftly and '^elegantly was 
little known, much lefs true philofophy. 
Lord Bacon, as is the fate of man, was 
more efteem'd after his death than in his 
life-time. His enemies were in the Britijh 
court, and his admirers were foreigners. 

When the marquis d'Effat attended in 
England upon the princefi Henrietta Ma^ 
riuy daughter to Henry the fourth, whom 
king Charles the firft had married, that rai- 
nifter went and vifited the \ovdiBaconj who 

being 



70 Letters concerning 

being at that time fick in his bed, received 
him with the curtains Ihut clofe. You re- 
fcmble the angels, fays the marquis to 
him J we hear thofe beings fpoken of per- 
petually, and we believe them fuperior to 
men, but are never allow'd the confolation 
to fee them. 

You know that this great man was ac- 
ais'dof a crime very unbecoming a philo- 
fopher, I mean bribery and extortion. You 
know that he was fentenc'd by the houle 
of lords, to pay a fine of about four hun- 
dred thoufand French livres ; to lofe his 
peerage and his dignity of chancellor. But 
in the prefent age, the Englijh revere his 
memory to fuch a degree, that they will 
fcarce allow him to have been guilty. In 
cafe you fhould alk what are my thoughts 
on this head, I fhall anfwer you in the 
word3 which I heard the lord Bolingbroke 
ufe on another occafion. Several gentlemen 
were fpeaking in his company, of the a- 
varice with which the late duke of Marl- 
borough had been charged, fome examples 
whereof being given, the lord Bolingbroke 
was appeaPd to, (who having been in the 
oppofite party, might perhaps, 'without the 
imputation of indecency, have, been allow'd 
to clear^ up that matter :) " He was fo 
" great a man, replied his lordlhip, that 
*' I have forgot his Vices.'* 

I SHALL 



the English Nation. 71 

I SHALL therefore confine myfelf to 
thofe things which fo juftly gain'd lord Ba- 
con theefteem of all Europe. 

The moftfingukr, and the leaftof all 
his pieces, is that which, at this time, is 
the moft ufelefs, and the leaft read, I mean 
his Novum Scientiamm Organum, This is 
the fcaffold with which the new philofophy 
was rais'd ; and when the edifice was built, 
part of it at leaft, the fcaffold was no longer 
of fervice. 

The lord Bacon was not yet acquainted 
with nature, but then he knew, and point- 
ed out, the feveral paths that lead to it. 
He had defpis'd in his younger years the 
thing caird philofophy in the univerfi- 
ties ; and did all that lay in his power to 
prevent thofe focieties of men, inftituted to 
improve human reafon, from depraving it 
by their quiddities, their horrors of the 
Vacuum^ their fubftantial forms, and all 
thofe impertinent terms which not only ig- 
norance had rendred venerable, but which 
had been made facred, by their being ridi- 
culoufly blended with religion. 

He is the father of experimental philo- 
fophy. It muft indeed be confefsM, that 
very furphfing fecrets had been found out 
before his time. The fea-compafs, print- 
mg, engraving on copper-plates, oil -pain t-

to read in his work, in exprefs terms, the

afcrib'd to Sir Ifaac iS'ewton. 

We muft fearch, fays lord Bacon^ whe- 
ther there may not be a kind of magnetic 
power, which operates between the earth 
and heavy bodies, between the moon and 
the ocean, between the planets, ISc. In 
another place he fays, either heavy bodies 
muft be carried towards the center of the 
earth, or muft be reciprocally attrafted by 
it; and in the latter cafe 'tis evident, that 
the nearer bodies, in their falling, draw to- 
wards the earth, the ftronger they will at- 
traft one another. We muft, fays he, make 
an experiment, to fee whether the fame 
clock will go fafter on the top of a moun- 
tain, or at the bottom of amine. Whether 
the ftrength of the weights dccreafes on the 
mountain, and incfeafes in the mine. 'Tis

Locke V and yet he was not deeply Ikill'd io 
the Qiathematicks. This great man could 
never ^ubjeft himfelf to the tedious fatigue 
of calculations, nor to the dry purfuit of 
mathematical truths, which do not at firft 
prefent any fenfibfe objefts to the mind.; 
and no one has given better proofs than 
he, that*tis poffible for amanto have a 
geometric^ head, without the affi fiance of 
geometry. Before his time, feveraU great 
philofophers had declared, in the moft po- 
fitive terms, what the foul of man is ; but 
as thefe abfolutely knew nothing about it, 
they might very well be allow'd to differ

and that the Heavens were of ftone % af- 
firmed that the foul was an aerial fpirit, but 
at the fame time immortal. Diogenes^ (not 
he who was a cynical philofopher after

Aristotle, who has been explained a

be thorougTily underftood^, before a p^^r- 
ion can be able to determine whether it 
be immortal or not. Human reafon is fo 
. little able, merely by its own ftrength, to t 
demonftrate the immortality of the foul,

God has endued the organs of beafts, who

AFrewchman, who arrives in Lon*

ry thing elfe, very much changed there. 
He had left the world a plenum^ and he 
no^v finds it a vacuum. At Paris the uni- 
verfe is feen compofed of vortices of 
fubtile matter ; but nothing like it is feen 
in London. In France it is the prefTurc of 
the moon that caufes the tides ; hut in 
England ic is the fea that gravitates towards 
the moon ; fo that wlicn you think that 
the moon fhould make it flood with us, 
thofe Gentlemen fancy it fhould be ebb, 
which, very unluckily^ cannot be proved. 
Far to be abile to do this, it is ncceffary

been enquired into, at the very inftant of 
the creation. 

Yqv\l obferve farther, that the fun, 
which in France is iaid to have nothing to 
do in the affair, comes in here for very 
near a quarter of its affiftance. Accord- 
ing to your CarteJianSy every thing is per-^ 
formed by an impulfion, of which we have 
very little notion •, and according to Sir 
Jfaac Newton^ it is by an attraftion, the 
caufe of which is as much unknown to us. 
At Paris you imagine that the earth is 
fhap'd like a melon, or of an oblique fi* 
gure ; at London it has an oblate one. A 
Cartejian declares that light exifts in the 
air ; but a -Newtonian afferts that it comes 
from the fun in fix minutes and a half. 
The feveral operations of your chymiftry 
arc performed by . Acids, Alkalies, and 
fubtile matter ; but attraftion prevails even 
in chymiftry among the Englijh. 

The very eflence ©f things is totally 
changed. You neither are agreed upon 
the definition of the Soul, nor on that of 
matter. Des Cartesi as I obierved in my 
laft, maintains that the Soul is the fame 
thing with thought; and Mr. Locke has 
given a pretty good proof of the con- 
trary. 

Des Cartes afferts farther, that exten- 
fion alone conftitutes matter, but Sir Ifaae 
adds folidity to it.

riibn ; dnd for no other reafon but becaufe 
Des Cartes was a Frenchman. 

It muft be confefe'd that thefe two 
great men difiier'd ▼cry much in cbndudl:, 
in fortune, and in philofophy. 

Nature had indulged Des Cartes a 
Ibining and ftrong imagination, whence 
he became a very Angular perfon both in 
private life, and in his manner of reafoning. 
This imagination could not conceal it felf 
even in his philofophical works, which are 
every where adorned with very ftiining, 
ingenious metaphors and figures. Nature 
had almoft made him a poet •, and indeed 
he wrote a piece of poetry for the enter- 
tainment of Cbrifiina Queen of Swedetiy 
which however was fupprefs'd in honour 
Co hi»«iemory. 

He embraced a military life for fomc 
time, and afterwards becoming a complete 
philofopher, he did not think the paffion 
of love derogatory to his chara6ter. He 
had by his miftrefe a daughter called Vron- 
tine^ who died young, and was very rafuch 
regretted by him. Thus he experienc'd 
every paffion incident to mankind. 

He was a long time of opinion, that it 
would be neceflary for him to fly from the

Des Cartes Was very right, for his 
contemporaries were not knowing^ enoiigh 
to improve and enlighten his underftand- 
ing, and were capable of little elfe than of 
giving him uneafinefe. 
• Kf^ left France purely to go in fearch of 
trudi, which was then perfecuted by the 
wretched philofophy of the fchools. How- 
ever, he found that reafon was as much 
difguis'd and depf aV'd in theuniverlities of 
Holland:^ into which he withdrew, as in 
his own country. For at the time that the 
French condemned the, only propofitions 
of his philofophy which were true, he 
was perfecuted by the prfiteijded philofo- 
ph^rs of Hellandy who underftood him no 
better 5 and who, having a nearer view of 
his glory, hated his perfon the more, fo 
that he was obliged to leave Utrecht. 
Des Cartes was injurioofly accused of being 
to atheift, the laft refuge of religious fean- 
dal : And 'he who had . employ'd all the 
fagacity and penetration of his genius, in 
fearching for new proofs of the exiftence 
of A God, was fufpefted to believe there 
was no fuch being. 

Svfcn aperfecutiofl from all fides, mull 
neceflarily fuppofe a moft exalted merit, as 
well as a very diftinguifti'd reputation : and 
indeed he poflcfs'd both. Reafon at that 
time darted a ray upon the world thro* the 
gloom, of the fchools, and the prejudices

Qi popular fupcrftition/ At laft his name 
Ipread lb univerfally, that the French were 
defirous of bringing him back into his na- 
tive country by rewards, and accordingly, 
offered him an annual jpenHon of a thou- 
fand crowns. Upon theie hopes Des 
Cartes rctum'd to France \ paid the feesr 
of his patent, which was fold at that time^ 
but no penfion was fettled upon him. Thus, 
difappointed, he returned to his folitude 
in tiartb'Uolland^ where he again purfued 
the ftudy of philofophy, whilft the great 
Galileo^ at fourfcore^ years of age, was. 
groaning in the prifons of the inquifition, 
only for having demonftrated the earth's 
motion. 

At laft D^j Cartes wzs fnatch'd from 
the world in the flower of his age at Stock-, 
holm. His death was owing to a bad Re- 
gimen, and he expired in the midft of fome 
Literati who were his enemies, and qnder 
the hand^ of a phyfician to whom he was 
odious. 

The progrefs of Sir Ifaac Newton'*S' life 
was quite different. He liv*d happy^ and 
very much honour*d in his native coun- 
try, to the age of fourfcore and five years. 

'XWAS his peculiar felicity, not only 
to be born in a country of liberty, but in 
an age when all fcholaftic impertinencies 
wxre banilh'd from the woild. Reafon

alone was cultivated, and mankind cou'd 
only be his pupil, not his enemy. 

One very lingular difference in the lives 
o( thefe two great men is, that Sir Ifaac^ 
during the long courfe of years he enjoyed, 
was never fenfible to any paffion, was not 
fubje<5t to the common frailties of man- 
kind, nor ever had. any commerce with 
women ; a circumftance which was aflur'd 
me by the phyfician and furgeon who at- 
tended him in his lail moments. 

We may admire Sir Ifaac Newton on 
this occafion, but then wc muft not cenjfurc 
Des Cartes. 

The opinion that generally prevails in 
Englandvfixh r^ard to thefe two philofo- 
phers is, that the latter was a dreamer, and 
the former a fage. 

Very few people in England read Des 
Cartes^ whofe works indeed are now ufe- 
lefs. On the other fide, but a fmall num- 
ber perufe thofe of Sir Ifdac^ becaufe to do 
•this the ftudent muft- -be deeply Ikiird in 
the mathematicks^ otherwifc thofe worlds 
will be unintelligible to him. But not- 
withftanding this, thefe great men are the 
fubjed of every one's difcourfe. Sir Ifaac 
Newton is allowed every advantage, whilft 
Des Cartes is not indulged a fmgle one. 
According to fome, it is to the former 
that we owe the difcovery of a Vacuum^ 
that the air is a heavy body, and the in- 
vention

In a critique that was made in London 
on Mr. dey^tttUneSe's difcounfe, the writer 
prefum*d to aflert that Des Cartes was not 
'a great geometrician. Thofe who make 
fuch a declaration may juftly be reproach* 
ed with flying in their mafter's face. Bes 
Cartes extended the limits of geometry as 
far beyond the place where he found them, 
as Sir Ifaac did after him. The former 
firft taught the method of exprefling curves 
by equations. Tjus geometry, which^ 
thanks to him for it, is now grown com- 
mon, was fo abHrufe in his time, that not , 
fo much as one profeflbr .would imdertafca 
to explain it -, and Scimttn in Holland^, and 
Format in Francty were the only men who 
cinderftpod it. 

He applied this geometrical and invcn- 
tive genius to dioptriclra, which, when 
treated of by him, , became a new art. 
And if he was miftaken in fome things, the 
reafon of that is, a man who difcovers a 
new tracSb of land cannot at once know all 
the properties of the foil. Thofe who 
come after him, and make thefe lands

LETTER XV. 

ON 

ATTRACTION. 

THE difcoverics, which gain'd Sir 
Ifaac Newton fo univerfal a reputa- 
tion, relate to the fyftem of the world, 
to light, to geometrical infinites, and laft- 
ly to chronology, with which he ufed to 
amufe himfelf after the fatigue of his fe-. 
verer ftudics. 

. I wi LL now acquaint you (without pro- 
lixity if poffible) with the few things I 
' have been able to comprehend of all thefe 
fublime ideas. With regard to the fyftem* 
of" our worlds dilputes were a long time 
maintain'd, on the caufc that turns the 
planets, and keeps them in their orbits ; 
and on thofe caufes which make all Bodies 
Mere below defccnd towards the furface of 
the earth. 

The fyftem of Des Cartes^ explained 
and improved fince his time, feemed to 
give a plaufible reafon for all thofe phse- 
nomena; and this reafon fecm*d more juft, 
as it is fimple, and intelligible to all capa- 
cities. But in philofophy aftiident ought 
to doubt of the things he fancies he under- 
F 2 ftands 



lOO L £ T T s & s concerni^ 

ftands too cafily, as much as of thofe he 
does not underftand* 

Gravity, the falling of Accelerated 
bodies on the earth, the revolution of the 
planets in their orbits, their rotations round 
their axes, all this is mere motion. Now 
motion cannot perh^s be conceived any 
otherwife than by impulfion ; therefore all 
thofe bodies muft be impelled. 3^t 
by what arc they impelled ? All fpace 
is full, it therefore h filled with a very fub- 
tile matter, fincc this is imperceptibly to 
ys •, this matter goes from weft to eaft, 
fince all the planets ar€ carried from, weft 
to eaft. Thus from hypothefis to hypo- 
thefis, from one appearance to another, phi- 
lofophers have imagined a vaft whirlpool of 
fubtile matter, in which the planets arc 
carried round the fun: They alfp have 
created another particular vortex which 
floats in the great one, and which turns 
daily round the planets. When all this 
is done, it is pretended that gravity dcr 
pends on this diurnal motion j for, fay 
tliefe, the velocity, of the fubtile matter 
that turns round our little vortex muft be 
feventeen times more rapid than that of the 
earth •, or, in cafe its vclocifty is feventeen 
times greater than that of the earth, its 
centrifugal force muft be vaftly greater, 
and cpnfequently impel all bodies towards 
the earth. This is the caufe of gravity, 

accord- 



/A^ English Nattov. loi 

Mcording to the Cartefian fyltem. But 
the theorift, before he Calculated the ccii- 
trifligal force and velocitjr of the lubtile 
matter, ihould firft have been certain that 
it exifted. 

SuL Ifaac Newton feems to have deftroj^X 
ed aH thde gJ'eat and little vortices, both I 
that which carries the pknets round the/ 
ftin, as weUas the other which fuppofes 
tvery |ilanet to turn on its owh axis. -^ 

First, with regard to the pretended 
Kttie vortex x)f the earth, it is dcThonftrat«>* 
cd that ifc muft lofe its motion by infehfible 
dqgreies ; it is dcmonftrltcd, that if the 
earai fwims in a fluids its denfity mu(l be 
equial tb that of the earth ^ and in cafe its 
d^fity be the fame, all the bodies we en- 
deavour to move muil meet with an infu* 
perable refiftance. 

With regard to the great vortices, 
they are ftill more chimerical, and it is 
impoflible to make them agree with Kep^ 
ier's law, the truth of which has been de- 
monftrated. Sir Ifaac fhews, that the 
revolution of the fluid, in which Jupiter 
is fuppbs*d to be carried, is not the fame 
with regard to the revolution of the fluid 
of the earth, as the revolution of Jupiter 
with refpeft to that of the earth. He 
proves, that as the planets makb their re- 
volutions in ellipfcs, and confequently be- 
ing at a much greater diflunce one from 
F 3 the 



loi . Letters concerning 

the other in their Afhelia^ and a little 
nearer in their Perihelia •, the earth's velo- 
city, for inftance, ought to be greater, 
when it is nearer Venus and Mars^ becaufe 
the fluid that carries it along, being then 
more prefs*d, ought to have a greater mo- 
tion ; and yet it is even then that the 
earth's motion is flower. 

He proves that there is no fuch thing 
as a celeflial matter which goes from wc;5 
io eaft:, fince the comets traverfe thofe 
fpaces, fometimes from eaft to wefl:, and 
at other times from north to fouth. , 

In fine, the better to refolve, if pof- 
fible, every difficulty, he proves, and even 
by experiments^ that it is impbffible there 
Ihould be a Plenum ; and brings back the 
Vacuum^ which Ariftotle and Des Cartes had 
baniftied from the world. 

Having by thiefe and feveral other ar- 
guments deftroyed the Cartejian vortices, 
he defpaired of ever being able to difcover, 
-whether there is a fecret principle in na- 
ture, which, at the fame time, is the 
caufe of the. motion of all celeftial bodies, 
and that of gravity on the earth. But be- 
ing retired in 1666, upon account of the 
plague, to a folitude near Cambridge \ as 
he was walking one day in his garden, 
-and faw fomc fruits fall from a tree, he 
fell into a profound meditation on that 
gravity^ the caufe of which had fo long 

been 



the English Nation- log: 
been fought, but in vain, by all the phi- 
lofophers, whillt the vulgar think there is 
pothing myfterions in it. He faid to him- 
felf, that from what height foever, in our 
hemifphere, thofe bodies might defcend^ 
their fall would certainly be in the pro- 
greflion difcovered by Galileo \ and the 
fpaceS;they run thro' would be as the fquare 
pf the times. Why may not thisi power 
iwhich caufes heavy bodies to defcend, and 
is the fame without any fenfible diminution 
at the remoteft diftance from the center 
of the earth, or on the fummits of the 
higheft mountains 5 Why, faid Sir Ifaat^ 
may not this power extend, as high as the 
moop? And in cafe its influence reaches 
fo far, is it not very probable that this 
power retains it in its orbit, and determines 
Its motion ? But in cafe the moon obeys 
this principle (whatever it be) may we not 
conclude very naturally, that the reft of 
the planets are equally fubjeft to it ? In. 
cafe this power exifts (which befides is 
proved) it muft increafe in an invcrfe 
Ratio of the fquares of the diftances. All 
therefore thaf remains is, to examine how 
far a heavy body, which fhould fall upon 
the earth from a moderate height, would 
^o ; and how far in the fame time, a body 
'■ which fhould fall from the orbit of the 
moon, would 'defcend. Tpfind this noj-

thing is wanted but the mcalure of the 
earth, and the diftance of the moon from it. 

Thus Sir Ifaac Newfan reafonM. But 
at that time the EngHJh had but a very 4m- 
pcrfed meafure of our globe, and depend* 
cd on the uncertain luppofition of mariners, 
who computed a degree to contain but 
fixty Englift) miles, whereas it coniifts in 
reahty erf" near ferenty. As this f5dfe com* 
putation did not agree with the conclur 
fions which Sir Ifaac intended to draw 
from them, he laid afide this pwfiiit. A 
half-learn*d philofopher^ remarkable only 
for his 'vanity, would have made the 
meafure of the earth agree, any how, 
with hisfyftem : Sir ij&irr, however, chofc 
' rather to quit the refearches he was then 
enga^M in. But after Mr. Picart had 
mealur'd the earth exaftly, by tracing that 
meridian, which redounds fo much to the 
honour of the French^ Sir I/aae Newton 
refum'd his former reflexions, and found 
his account in Mr. Picart* % calculation. 

A eircumftance which has always ap- 
peared wonderful to me is, that fuch fub- 
limedifcovcries fhould have been made by 
the fole afTillance of a quadrant, and a little 
ftrithmetic.

THfi inftant we know the earth's cir*

we know that of the inoon's crWt, and 
the diameter of this orbit. The moon 
^xioxttA its revolution in that orbit \n

the moon in its mean motion makes atv

khoWii theorem, that the central force 
which ihould make a body fall from the

which bodies gravitate, and attraft one an-

the diftainces be true -, if the fame power

a hctivy body muft neceflarily fall (on the 
earth) fifteeix ftec in the firlt lecond, and 
fifty Your Ihoufahd feet 'm the firft mipute. 

Now a heavy body falls, in reality, fif-

vity on earth, and keeps the moon in its

ing demonftrated that the moon gravitates 
on the earth, which is the center of its 
particular motion, it is demonftrated thac 
the earth and the moon gravitate on the 
fun, which is the center of their annual 
motion. 

The reft of the planets muft be fubjedt 
to this general law ; and if this law exifts^ 
thefe planets muft follow the laws . which 
Kepler difcover'd. All thefe laws, all thefc 
relations are indeed obferv'd by the pla- 
nets with the utmoft exadnefs ; therefore 
the power of AttraAion caufes all the pla- 
nets to gravitate towards, the fun, in like 
manner as the moon gravitates towards 
our globe. 

Finally, .as in all bodies, re-aftioa 
is equal to aftion, it is certain that the 
tarth gravitates alfo towards the moon ; 
'4nd that the fun gravitates towards both : 
That evitry one of the fatellites of Saturn 
gravitates cowards the other four, and the 
other four towards it: AH five towards 
Saturn^ and Saturn towards all. That it 
is the faft^e with regard to Jupiter ; and* 
that all thele globes are attrafted by the

them. 

This

This power of gravitation a6ts propor- 
tionably to the quantity of matter in bodies,, 
a truth which Sir Ifaac has demonftrated 
by experiments. This new difcovcry has* 
bcen^f ufe to fhew, that the fun (the cen- 
ter of the planetary fyftem) attrafts fhem 
all in a direft ratio of their quantity of 
matter combined with their nearnefs. 
From hence Sir Ifaac^ rifing by degrees 
to 'difcpverics which feem'd not to be 
form'd for the human mind, is bold 
enough to compute the quantity of matter 
contained in the fun and in every planet ;. 
and in this manner fhews, from the fimple 
law of mechanicks, that every celeftial 
globe ought neceffarily to be where it is 
placed. 

His bare principle of the laws of gra- 
vitation accounts for all the apparent ine- 
qualities in thecourfeof the celeftial globes. . 
The variations of the moon are a necefla- 
ry confcqucnce of thofe laws. Moreover 
the reafoft is evidently feen why the nodes 
of the moon perform their revolutions im 
nineteen years, and thofe of the earth in. 
about twenty fix thoufand The feveral

After having; (hewn, by his fublime 
theory, the courie and inequalities of the 
planets, he fubjeds comets to the fame 
taw. The orbit of thefe fires (unknowa 
for fo great a leries of years) whkh was 
the terror of mankind, and the rock againft 
which philofc^y fpKt ; plac'd by AriftctU 
below the moon, and fent back by Dt^ 
Cartes above the inhere of Saturn j is at 
bft placed in its proper feat by Silr Jfaac 
Newton. 

He proves that comets are folid bodies 
which move in thcfphere of the fun*s afti- 
vity V 2Uid that they defcribe an eUipfis fa 
very eccentric, and fo near to parabola^ 
that certain comets muft take up above 
JBve hundred years in the revolution. 

The learned Dr. /^^//fy is of opinion, 
that the comet feen in 1 680, is the fame 
which appeared in Jutm$>^4efar'^ time. 
This fhews more than any other, that co- 
mets are hard, opake bodies ; for it de- 
fended fo near to the fun, as to come 
within a fixth part of the diameter of this 
placet from it ; and confequently mighc 
have ccMitrafted a degree of heat two thou* 
fand times ftfon^er than that of red hot 
iron ; and would have been foon di^ers*d 
in vapour, had it not been a firm, denfe 
bpdy. The guefling the courfe of co- 
mets 



the English Natiow* 109 

mfcts began then to be very much in 
vogue : The cekbrated Bernoulli conclud- 
ed by hils fyftem, that the famous comet 
of 1680, would appear ?gain the 17th of 
May 1719. Not a fingle aftronomer in 
Eurtpe went to bed that night; however 
they needed not to have broke their reft, 
for the famous comet never iappear'd^ 
There is at leaft more cunning, if not more 
certainty, in fixing its return to fo remote 
a diftance as five hundred and fevcnty five 
years. As to-Mr. Whifioriy he affirm'd very 
ferioufly, that in the time of a deluge a 
comet overflowed the terreftrial globe ; 
and he was fo unrea&nable as to wonder 
that people laugh'd at him for making 
foch an affertion. The ancients were aP 
moft in the fame way of thinking with 
Mr. Whifton^ and fancied that comets were 
always the fore-runners of fome great 
calamity which was to befal mankind. Sir 
Ifaac NewtoHy on the contrary, fufpeded 
riiat they are very beneficent -, and that 
vapours exhale from them merely to nou- 
rifc and vivify the planets, which imbibe 
in their courie the feveral particles the fun 
has detach'd from the comets ; an opinion 
which at leaft is more probable than the 
former. But this is not all. If this power 
of Gravitatipnor Attraftion a«5ls on all the 
eeleftial globes, it adls undoubtedly on the 
feveral parts of thde globes:. For in cafe 

bodies 



no Letters concerning 

bodies attract one another in proportion to 
the quantity of matter contained in them, 
it can only be in proportion to the quanti- 
ty of their parts; and if this power is 
found in the whole, it is undoubtedly in 
the half, in the quarter, in the eighth part, 
and fo on in infinilum* 

This is Attraftion, the great fpring by . 
which all nature is mov'd. Sir Ifaac 
Newton^ after having demonftrated the 
exiftencc of this principle, plainly forefaw 
that its very name wou*d offend ; and 
therefore this philofopher in nK>re places 
than one of his books, gives the reader 
fome caution about it. He bids him be- 
ware of confounding this name with what 
the Ancients called occult qualities •, but to 
be fatisfied with knowing that there is in 
all bodies a central force which afts to the 
utmoft limits of the univcrfe, according 
to the invariable laws of mechanicks. 

It is furprifmg, after the folemnpro- - 
teftations Sir i/^^^made, that fuch eminent 
men as Mr. Sorin and Mr. de Fontenelle^ 
fliould have imputed to this great philofo^ 
pher the verbal and chimeric^ way of rea- 
foning of the Arijlotelians \ Mr. Sorin in the 
memoirs of the academy of 1709, and 
Mr. de Fontenelle in the very elogium of Sir 
Jfaac Newtm. 

Most of the French^ the learned and 
Others, have repeated this reproach. Thefe 

are

are for ever crying out, why did he not 
employ the word Impulfion^ which is fo 
well underftood, rather than that of At- 
tra£lion^ which is unintelligible ? 

Sir Ifaac might have anfwerM th^fe 
criticks thus : Firft, you have as imperfeft 
an idea of the word Impulfion as of that 
of Attraftion ; and in cafe you cannot con- 
ceive how one body tends towards the cen- 
ter of another body, neither can you con- 
ceive by what power one body can impel 
another. \.-,

I HAVE taught you, may Sir Ifaac re-» 
Join, that all bodies gravitate towards one 
another in proportion to their quantity of 
matter; that thcfc central forces alone 
keep the planets and comets in their orbits, 
and caufe them to move in the proportion 
before let down. I dcmonftrate to you, 
that it if impoffible there ihould be any o- 
ther caufe which keeps the planets in their 
orbits, than that general phaenomenon of 
gravity. For heavy bodies fall oh the 
earth according to the proportion demon- 
ftrated of central forces % and the planets 
Bniihing their courfe according to thcfc 
isimt proportions, in cafe there were ano- 
ther power that afted ypon all thofe bo- 
dies, it wouW either increafe their velocity,- 
or change their direftion. Now not one 
of thofe bodies ever has a fingle degree of 
motion or velocity, or has any direftion 
but what is demonftrated to be the effeft 
of the central forces ; confequently it is 
impoffible there fhould be any other 
principle. 

Give me leave oilce more to introduce:

kind an indifputable truth ; but afe they

air is unknown, but he who firft difcover'd 
this fpring performed a very fignal fervice 
to natural philofophy. The (bring that I 
difcoverM was more hidden and more uni- 
▼erfal, and for that very rcfafon mankind 
ought to thank me die more. I have dip

this (hall people quarrel wth me about the

THE Philofophers of the laft age 
found out a new uniyerfe; and a 
circumftancewhich made its difcovery more 
dilEcult was9 that no one had fb much as 
fufpedted its exiftence. The moft fagc and 
ividicious were, of opinion, that 'twas a 
frantick raihnefs to dare fomuch as to ima- 
gine, that it was poffible to guefs the kws 
by which the celeftial bodies move, and the 
manner how light a<5ts, Galileo^ by his 
aftronomical difcoverics, Kepler by his cal- 
cnlation, DesCartes fat leaft in his diopticks) 
and Sir 'Ifaac Newton (in all his works) fe- 
verally faw the mechanifm of the fprings 
of the world. The geometricians have 
fubjcfted infinity to the laws of calcula- 
tion. The circulation of the blood in ani- 
mals, and of the fap in vegetables, have 
changed the face of nature with regard to 
us. A new kind of exiftence has been giv- 
en 



the English Natton. ii^ 
en to bodies in the air-pump. By the af 
fiftance of telefcopes bodies have beer 
brought nearer to one another. Finally, 
the feveral difcoveries which Sir Ifadc New- 
ton has made on light, are equal to th( 
boldeft things which the curiofity of mar 
could cxpe6t, after fo many philofophica 
novelties. 

Till Antonio deDominis^ the rainbov 
was confider'd as an inexplicable miracle 
This philofopher guefs'd, that it was 5 
neceflary cfFedt of the iiin and rain. De 

' Cartes gained immortal fame bv his ipathe 
matical explication of this fo natural ; 
phaenomenon. He calculated the refleftion 

' and refraftions of light in drops of rain 
and his fagacity on this occafion was at tha 
time iook'd upon as next to divine. 

But what would he. have faid had i 
becnprov*d to him, that he was miftaken 11 
the nature of light; that he- had not th 
leaft reafon to maintain that *tis a globula 
body ; that 'tis falfe to aflert, that thi 
matter fpreading itfelf through the whole 
waits only to be projefted forward by th 
fun, in order to be put in aftion, in lik 
manner as a long ftaff afts at one end whe 
pulh'd forward by the other -, that ligh 
is certainly darted, by the fun ; in fine, tha 

* light is tranfmitted from the fun to th 
earth in about f^Ytn minutes, tho* a can

velocity, cou*d not go that diftance m left 
than twenty-five years ? How great wou'd 
have been his aftoniflunent, had he been 
told, dut light does not refleft dire£Hy by 
impinging againft the fblid parts of bodies \ 
that bodies are not tranfparent when they 
have large pores ; and that a man fliould a« 
rife, who would demonftrate all thefe pa* 
radoxesy and anatomize a finelc rav of light 
with more dexterity than the abteft ardft 
difle6fcs a human body? This man is come. 
Sir Ifaac Niwicn has demonftrated to the 
eye, by the bare aflUbuice of theprifin, that 
lightisacompofitionofcoloar*drays,which^ 
being united, form the white colour. A 
linglc ray is by him divided into feVen, 
!Hrhich all fall upon a piece of linnen, or a 
Iheet of white paper, in their order one a<* 
bovcf the other, and at unequal diftances. 
The firft i;s red, the fecond orange, the 
third yellow, the fourth green, the fifth 
blue, the fixth indigo, theicventh a violet 
purple. Each of thefe rays tranfmitted af- 
terwards by an hundred other prifms, will 
never change the colour it bears ; in like 
manner as gold, when completely purg'd 
from its drofs, will never change after- 
wards in the crucible. As a fuperabun- 
dant proof that each of thefe elementary 
rays has inherently in itfelf that which 
forms its colour to the eve, take a fmall 
piece of yellow wood for inftance, and fet 

it

it in the ray of a red colour, this wood will 
inilantly be ting'd red| but fet it in the ray 
of a green colour, it afiumes a green co- 
lour, and fo id all ^e reft. 

From what caufe therefore do colours 
arif^ in nature ? 'Tis nothing but the difpo* 
fitibn of bodifs^ to refle<£l the rays of a cer- 
tain ord^, and to' abforb sdl the reft. 

What then is this fecret difpofition ? 
Sir Ifaac N&wton^ demonftrates, that 'tis 
nothing more than the denfity of the fmall 
conftituent particles of which a body is 
composed. And how is this reflexion per- 
form'd ? 'Twas fuppos*d to arife from the ' 
rebounding of the rays, in the fame man- 
ner as a ball on the furface of a folid body ; 
but this is a miftake, for Sir Ifaac taught 
the aftonifh'd philoftiphers, that bodies are 
opake for no other reafon, but beeaufe 
their pores are large j that light rcflcfts on 
bur eyes from the very bolbm of thofe 
pores ; that the fmaller the pores of a body 
are, the more fuch a body is tranfparent. 
Thus paper, which reflets the light when 
dry, tranfmits it when oiPd^ becaufe the 
pil, by filling its pores, makes them much 
{hiaUer. 

*Tis there that examining the yaft poro- 
fity of bodies, every particle having its 
pores, and every particle of thofe particles 
having its own ; he fliew^ we are not 
certain that there is a cubic inch of folid 

matfter 



ii8 Letters concerning 

matter in the univcrfc, fo far arc wc from 
conceiving what matter is. Having thus 
divided, as it were, light into its elements, 
and carried thefagacity of his difcoveries lb 
far, as to prove the method of diftinguifli- ' 
ing compound colours from fuch as are pri- 
mitive ; he (hews, that thcfc elementary 
rays, feparated by the prifm, are rang'd in 
their order for no other reafon but becaufe 
they are refra6ked in that very order ; and 
*tis this property (unknown till he diico- 
ver*d it) of breaking or fplitting in this 
proportion ; 'tis this unequal refradtion of 
rays, this power of refrading the red Icfs 
than the orange colour, (Jc. which he calls 
the different refrangibility. The moft re- 
flexible rays are the moft refrangible, and 
from hence he evinces that the- fame power 
is the caufe both of the reflexion and re- 
fraction of light. 

But all thefe wonders are merely but 
the opening of his difcoveries. He found 
out the fecret to fee the vibrations or fits of 
light, which come and go inceffantly, and 
which either tranfmit light, or refleft it ac- 
cording to the denfity of the parts they 
meet with. He has prefum'd to calculate 
the denfity of the particles of air neceflary 
between two glafles, the one flat, the other 
convex on one fide, fet one upon the other -, 
in order to operate fuch a tranfmiffioh cr 
reflexion, or to form fuch and fuch a colour.

From all thefe combinations he difco- 
vers the proportion in which light afts* on 
bodies, and bodies aft on light* 

He faw light fo perfeftly, that he has 
detern^in'd to what' degree of perfeftioir 
the art of increafijtig it, and of affifting 
our eyes by telefcopes, can be carried. 

Des Cartes, from a noble confidence, 
that was very excufable confidering how 
ftrongly he was fir'd at the firft difcoveries 
he made in an art ^hich he almoft firft 
found out ; Des Cartes^ I fay, hoped to 
difcover in the ftars, by the afliftance of 
telefcopes, objeds as fmall as thofe we dif- 
cern upon the earth. 

But Sir Ifaac has fhewn, that dioptric 
telefcopes cannot be brought to a greater 
perfeftion •, becaufe of that refraftion, and 
of that very refrangibility, which at the 
fame time that they bring objefts nearer to 
us, fcatter too much the elementary rays ; 
he has calculated in thefe glafles the pro- 
portion of the fcattering qf the red and of 
the blue rays .; and proceeding fo far as to 
^demonftrate things which were not fup- 
pos'd even to cxift, -he examines the in-^ 
equalities which arife from the Ihape or 
figure of the glafs, and that which arifes 
from the refrangibility. He finds, that th# 
objeft glafs of the telefcope being convex 
on one fide, and flat on the other, in cafe 
the flat fide be turn'd towards the objeft, 

the 



the errojr which arifes from the conftruffion 
and pofldoii of the ghds i& above five 
thoufand times lefs than the error which 
arifes from the refrangibility : And there- 
fore» that the fliape or figure of the glafies 
is not the cau& why tdcibopes cannot be 
carried to a greater perfeAiony but arifea 
wholly from the natiu-e of lig^. 

For this realbn he invent^ a teleicope, 
which difcovers objeds by reflexion^and 
not by rcfradion. Tckfcopcs.of this^ne^f 
kind are very hard u> make, and their ufc 
is not eafy. But according to the EngU/b^ 
a refle&ive tclefcopc of but five feet has

ON 

Infinites in Geometryj 

AND 

Sir Ifaac Newton's 
CHRONOLOGY. 



TH E labyrinth and abyfs of infinity is 
alio a new courfe Sir Ifaac Newton 
has gone through, and we are oblig'd to 
him for the clue, by whofe afliftance we 
are enabled to trace its various windings. 

Des Cartes got the ftart of him alfo 
in this aftbnifhing invention. He advanced 
with mighty fteps in his geometry, and was 
arrived at the very borders of infinity, but 
went no farther. Dr. WalUs^ about the 
middle of the laft century, was the firfl: 
^ho reduc'd a fraftion, by a perpetual divi- 
fion, to an infinite feries* 



122 l^ETT EM s cancenA^ 

The lord Brounker employ 'd this feries 
to fquare the hyperbola. 

Mercator publifh'd a deinonftration 
of this quadrature, much about which time 
Sir Jfaac NexctOHj being then twenty-three 
years of age, had invented a general me- 
thod to perform, on all geometrical curves, 
•what had juft before been try'd on the hy- 
perbola. 

'Tis to this method T)f fubjefting every 
where innnity to algebraical calculations, 
that the name is given of difierential cal- 
culations or of fluxions, and u.*tegral cal- 
culation. *Tis the art of numbering and 
meafuring exadtly a thing whofe exiftence 
cannot be cdhcciv'd. 

And, indeed, would you not imagine 
that a man laugh'd at you, who fhould de- 
clare that there are lines infinitely great 
which form an angle infinitely little ? 

That a right line, which is a right line 
fo long as it is finite, by changing infinitely 
little its direftion, becomes an mfinite curve, 
and that a curve may become infinitely lefe 
than another curve ? 

That there are infinite fquares, infinite 
cubes, and infinites of infinites, all greater 
than one. another, and the laft but one of 
which, is nothing in comparifon of the laft ? 

All thefe things which at firft appear to 
be the utmoft cxcefs of frenzy, are in rea- 
lity an effort of the fubtilty and extent of 

the 



/i&^ English Nation, 123 

th€ human mind; and the art of finding 
truths which till then had been unknown. 

Th I s fo bold edifice is even founded on 
fimplc ideas. The bufinefs is to meafure 
the diagonal of a fquare, to give the area 
of a curve, to find thfe fquare root of a 
number, which has none in common arith- 
metic. After all, the imagination ought 
not to be ftartled any more at fp many or- 
ders of infinites, than at the fo well known 
propofition, viz. that curve lines may al- 
ways be made to pafs between a circle and 
• a tangent ; or at that other, namely that 
matter is divifible in infinitum. Thefe two 
truths have been demonftrated many years, 
and are no lefs incomprehenfible than ths 
things we have been fpeaking of. 

For many years the invention of this 
famous calculation was denied Sir Ifaac 
Newton. In Germany Mr. Ltibnitz was 
confider*d as the inventor of the differences 
or moments, call'd * Fluxions^ and Mr. 
Bernouilli claimed the integral calculation^ 
However, Sir Tfnac is now thought to have 
firft made the difcovery, and the other two 
have the glory of having ohce made the 
world doubt whether 'twas to be afcrib'd to 
him or them. Thus fome contefted with 
Dr. Harvey the invention of the circulation 
of the blood, a^ others difputed with

Hartsocher and Lewenboeck difputed 
with each other the honour of having firft 
feen the Vermiculi of which mankind are 
form'd. This Hartfocher alfo conteflcd 
with Huygens the invention of a new me- 
thod of calculating the diftance of a fix'd 
ftar. 'Tis not yet known to whatphilofo- 
pher we owe the invention of the cycloid. 

Be this as it will, 'tis by the help of 
this geometry of infinites that Sir Ifaac 
Newton attained to the moft fublime difcq- 
veries. I am now to fpeak of another 
work, which tho' more adapted to the ca- 
pacity of the human mind, does neverthe- 
iefs difplay fome marks of that creative ge^ 
nius with which Sir Ifaac Newton was in- 
form'd in all his refearches. The work I 
mean is a chronology of a new kind j for 
what province foevcrhe undertook, he was 
fure to change the ideas and opinions re^ 
ceiv'd by the reft of men. 

Accustomed to vmravel and difintangle 
chaos's, he was refolv'd to convey at leaft 
fome light into that of the fables of anti- 
quity, which are blended and confounded 
with hiftory, and fix an uncertain chrono- 
logy. 'Tis true, that there is no family, 
city or nation, but endeavours to remove 
its original as far backward as poflible. Be- 
fidcs, the firft hiftorians were the moft neg- 
ligent 



t&f Ekclish Nation. 125 
Hgent in fetting down the aeras ; books 
were infinitely lefs common than they are 
at this time, and confequently authors be- 
ing not fo obnoxious to cenfure, they there- 
fore imposed upon the world with greater 
impunity ; and as *tis evident that thefe 
have related a great number of fiftitious 
particulars, 'tis probable enough that they 
alfo gave us feveral falfe aeras. 

It appeared in general to Sir Ifaac^ that 
the world was five hundred years younger 
than chronologers declare it to be. He 
grounds his opinion on the ordinary courfe 
of nature, and on the obfervations wHich 
aftronomers have made. 

By the courfe of nature we here under- 
ftandthe time that every generation of men 
lives upon the earth. The Egyptians firft 
employed this vasue and uncertain method 
of calculating, when they began to write 
the beginning of their hiftory. Thefe com- 
puted three hundred and forty one genera* 
tions from Menes to SeibM\ and having no 
fix'd aera, they fuppos*d three generations 
to confift of an hundred years. In this 
manner they computed eleven thoufand 
three hundred and forty years from Menes^% 
reign to that of Sethon. 

The Greeks^ before they counted by 

olympiads, followed the method of the £- 

gyptians^ and even gave a little more ex-

Now here both the Egyptians and the 
Greeks made an erroneous computation. 
^1 'is true indeed, tharaccording to the 
tifual courfe of nature three generations 
laft about an hundred and twenty years : 
but three reigns are far from taking up fo 
many. 'Tis very evident, that mankind 
in general live longer than kings are found 
to reign : So that an author who (hould 
write a hiftory, in which there were no 
dates fix'd, and fliould know tha't niag 
kings had reign'd over a nation ; fuch an 
hiftorian would commit a great error (hould 
he allow three hundred years to thefe nine 
monarchs. Every generation takes about 
thirty-fix years; every reign is, one with 
the other, about twenty* Thirty kings of

You know that the earth, befides its

was quite unknown till within theie late

rence of the whole heaven. Thus after 
fevcnty-two years the Cclure of the vernal 
equinox, which pafs'd thro' a fix'd ftar, cor- 
relponds with another fix*d ftar. Hence it 
is, that the fun, inftead of being in that, 
part of the heavens in which the Ram was 
fituated in the time of Htpparchus^ is found 
to correfpond with that part of the hea- 
vens in which the Bull was fituiitcd 5 and

manner of fpeaking as the ancients did. In . 
this age we fay that the fun is in the Ram 
In the fpring^ from the fame principle of 
condefcenfion that we fay that the fun turns 
jound. 

HrppARCHus was the firft among the 
Greeks who obferv'd fome change in the 
conftellations, with regard to the equinoxes, . 
or rather who learnt it from the Egyptians^ 
Philoibphers afcrib'd this motion to the 
ftars; for in thofe ages people were far from 
imagining fuch a revolution in the earthy 
which was fuppos'd to be immoveable in 
every rc^)cft. They therefore created a 
heaven k which they fix'd the feveral itars, 
and g«K tlus hes^en a particular motion

yhStti thiK dl the ftars feem'd to perform 
their diurnal revriuticMi from eaft to weft. 
To this error they added alecond of much ' 
greater confequence, by imagining that the 
pretended heaven of the fix'd ftars ad- 
vanced one degree eaftward every hundred 
years. In this manner they were no lefs. 
miftaken in their aftronomical calculation 
than in their fyftem of natural philofophy.

vatioii, Jn fuch a fign, and in fuch a ftar; 
It has advanc'd two degrees of each fince 
the time that obfervation was made to the 
prelcnt. Now two degrees are equivalent 
to two hundred years j confequently the 
aftronomer who made that obfervation 
liv'd juft fo many years before me. 'Tis cer- 
tain that an aftronomer who had argued in 
this manner would have miftook juft fifty- 
four years •, hence it is that the ancients, 
who were doubly deceiv'd, made their 

Sjreat year of the world, that is, the revo- 
ution of the whole heavens, to confift of 
thirty-fix thoufand years. But the moderns 
are fenfible that this imaginary revolution 
of the heaven of the ftars, is nothing elfe 
than the revolution of the poles of the 
>earth, which is performed in twenty-five 
thoufand nine hundred years. It may be 
proper to obferve tranfiently in this place, 
that Sir Ifaacy by determining the figure 
of the earth, has very happily explained 
the caufe of this revolution. 

All this being laid down, the only 
thing remaining to fettle chronology, is, to 
fee thro' what ftar the Colure of the equi- 
noxes pafles, and where it interfcfts at this 
time the ecliptick in the Ipring j and to 
"difcover whether feme ancient writer does 
not tell us in what point the ecliptick was 
interfered in his time by the fame Colure 
of the equinoxes.

the world is not fo old by five hundred

tAis calculation all the seras arc drawn

have happen'd later than is computed. I* 
don't know whether this ingenious fyftem

thefe notions will prevail fo far with the

chronology of the world. Perhaps thefe 

fentlemen would think it too great a con-' 
dcenfion, to allow one and the fame man 
the glory of having improved natural phi- 
iofophy, geometry and hiftory. This would. 
be a kind of univerfal monarchy, which the 
principle of felf-love that is in man will 
fcarce fufFer him to indulge his fellow-crea- 
ture ; and, indeed, at th'e fame time that 
fome very great philofophers attacked Sir 
ffnac Newton^s attraftive principle, others 
feH upon his chronological fyftem. Time, 
that ihou*d difcover to which of thefc the

TRAGEDY. 



THE Englijhy as well as the Spani- 
ards^ were poffefs'd of theatres, at 
a time when the French had no more than 
moving, itinerant ftages. Sbahjpeare^ who 
was confider'd as the Corneille of the firft 
mentioned nation, was pretty near contem- 
porary with Lopez de^Vega^ and he created, 
as it were, the Englifh theatre. Sbakefpeare 
boaftcd a ftrong^ fruitful genius : He was 
natural and fublime, but had not fo much 

' aranngle iparic of good tafte, or knew 
one rule of the drama. ' 1 will now hazard 
a random, but, at the fame time, true re- 
flexion, which is, that the great merit of 
this dramatic poet has been the ruin of the 
.jEag'i^ flage. There are fuch beautiful, 
fuch noble, fuch dreadful fcenes in this 
writer's monftrous farces, to which the 

' name of Tragedy is given, that they have 
always been exhibited with great fuccefs. 
Time, which only gives reputation to wri* 

ters:i

tcrs, at laft makes their very faults vener- 
able. Moft of the whimfical, gigantic 
images of this poet, have, thro* length of 
time (it being an hundred and fifty years 
fince tiiey werefirft drawn) acquired a right 
of pafling for fublime. Moft of the mo- 
dern dramatick writers have copied him ; 
but the touches and dcfcriptions which are 
applauded in Sbakefpeare^ are hifs'd at in 
thefe writers ; and you'll eafily believe, 
that the veneration in which this author is - 
held increafes in proportion to the con- 
tempt which is fhewn to the moderns. 
Dramatick writers don't confider that they 
fh^uld not imitate him j and the ill fuccefs 
of Sbakejpeare^s imitators produces no other 
effeft, than to make him be confider'd as 
inimitable. You remember, that in the 
tragedy of Othello Moor of Venice, (sl 
moft tender piece) a man ftrangles his wife 
on the ftage -, and that the poor woman, 
whilft Ihe is ftrangling, cries aloud, that 
(he dies very unjuftly. You know that in 
Hamlet Prince of Denmark, two grave- 
diggers make a grave, and are all the time 
drinking, fmging ballads, and making hu- 
morous refleftions (natural indeed enough 
to perfons of their profeflion) on the fede- 
ral IkuUs they throw up with their fpades j 
but a circumftance which will furprize you 
is, that this ridiculous incident has been 
imitated. In the reign of king Cbarks th?

the golden age of the liberal arts, Otway^ 
in his Venice Preserved, introduces An- 
tonio the fenator,. and NaH his courtezan, 
in the midft erf" the horrors of the marquis 
of Bedmar's confpiracj. Antonio^ the fu- 
perannuated fenator, plays in his miftrcfs's 
prefence, all the apifh tricks of a lewd, im- * 
potent debauchee, who is quite frantic and 
out of his fenfes. He mimicks a bull and 
a dog ; and bites his miftrefs's legs, who 
kicks and whips him, ' However, the play- 
ers have ftruck thcfe buffooneries (which 
• indeed were calculated merely for the dregs 
of the people) out of Otway^s tragedy ; but 
they have ftill left in Shake^eare'^ Julius 
CiESAR, the jokes of the Roman Aoemakers 
and coblers, who are introduc'd in the fame 
fcene with Brutus and CaJ/ius. You will 
undoubtedly complain, thatthofe who have 
hitherto difcours'd wirfi you on the EnglijH 
ftage, and efpecially on the celebrated 
Sbakefpearej have taken notice only of his 
errors ; and that no one has tranflaced any . 
©f thofe ftrong, thofe forcible palTages 
which atone for all his faults.- But to this 
. I will anfwer, that nothing is eafier than 
to exhibit in profc all tSie filly impertinen- 
cies which a poet tmj have thrown out •,. 
but that 'tis a very difficult talk to rrafiflate

join in opinion with allperfons of good tafte, 
in declaring, that greater advantage may 
be reap'd from a dozen verfes of Homer ^ov 
Virgil^ than from all the critiques put to-

treating of Comedy merely to cenfurc Shad- 
well, the comic writer. This author was 
had in pretty great contempt in Mr. de 
Muralt*& time, and was not the poet of

whom he yet is fulpicious of, and a mif-

THERE oricc was a time in France^ 
when the polite arts were cultivated 
by perfons of the higheft rank in the ftate* 
The courtiers particularly were conver-. 
j^nt in them, although indolence, a tafle^ 
for trifles, and a paflion for intrigue, were 
the divinities of the country. The court, me- 
thinks, at this ti^ne feems to have given inta 
^ taftc quite oppofite to. that of polite lite-

xnay be revived in a little time. The

There are about eight hundred perfons in 
England who have a right to fpeak in pub- 
lic, and to fupport the intereft of the 
kingdom; and near five or fix thoufand 
may, in their turns, afpire to the fame ho-

has the liberty of publilhing his thoughts 
with regard to public affairs; which ftiews 
that all the people in general are indifpen-

a great number of the clergy are abler

written his Elogium, buc ftill his name 
only is known. He had much the fame 
reputation in London as Voitun had in Pa- 
risy and in my opinion deierved it better. 
Voiiure was born in an age that was juft 
emerging fix)m barbarity 5 an age that was 
ftill rude and ignorant, the people of 
which aimed at wit, tho* they had not the 
leaft pretenfions to it, and fought for points 
and conceits initead of fentiments. Brif- 
tol Stones are more eafily found than Dia- 
monds. Voiturey born with an eafy and 
fiivolous genius, was the firft who fhohc 
in this Aurora of French literature. Had 
he come into the world after thofe great 
genius's who fpread fuch a glory over the 
age of Lewis the Fourteenth, he would 
either have been unknown, would have 
been defpifed, or would have corredkcd his 
ftyle. Boileau applauded him, but it was 
in his firft fatyrs, at a time when the taftc 
of that great poet was not yet formed. 
He was young, and in an age when per- 
fons form a judgment of men froni their 
reputation, and not from their writings. 
Befides, Boileau was very partial both in 
his encomiums and his cenfures. He ap- 
plauded Segraisj whofe works no body- 
reads 5 he abufed ^inauU^ whofe poetical 
pieces every one has got by heart, and is 
wholly 6lenC upon La Fontaine. Waller^ 
though a better poet than Voiture^ was not 

ye«

yet a finilhed poet. The graces breathe 
in fuch of fTaller^s works as arc writ in a 
tender ftrain, but then they are languid 
thro* negligence, and often disfigured with 
falfe thoughts. The Englifi had not, in 
his time, attained the art of correft writ- 
ing. But his ferious compofitions exhibit 
a (trengdi and vigour which could not 
have been e^edted from the foftnefs and 
effeminacy of his other pieces. . He wrote 
an clecy on Oliver Cromwell^ which, with 
all its faults, is neverthelefs looked upon as 
a mafter-picce. To underftand this copy 
of verfes, you arc to know that the day 
Oliver died was remarkable for a great 
ftorm. His poem begins in this manner :

derftood but by few among the laity. To 
explain this a commentary would be requi- 
fite, and humour when explained is no 
longer humour. Whoever fets up for a , 
commentator of fmart fayings and repar- 
tees, is himfelf a blockhead. This is the 
reafon why the works of the ingenious Dean 
Swifi^ who has been caird the Englijh Ra- 
helais^ will never be well underftood in 
France. ' This gentleman has the honour 
(in common with Rabelais) of being a ' 
prieft, and like him laughs at every thing. 
But in my humble opinion, the title of the 
Englijh Raklaisy which is given the dean, 
is highly derogatory to his genius. The 
former has interipers*d his unaccountably- 
fantaftic and unintelligible bopk, with the 
moft gay ftrokes of humour, but which at 
the fame time has a greater proportion of 
impertinence. He has been vadly laviihof^ 
erudition, of fmut, and infipid raillery. 
An agreeable tale of two pages is purchas'd 
at the expence of whole volumes of non- 
fenfe. There are but few perfons, and 
thofe of a grotefque tafte, who pretend t« 
undcrftand, and to efteeni this work ; for 
as to the reft of the nation, thev laugh at 
the pleafant and diverting touches which - 
are found in Rabelais^ and defpife his Book. 
He is look'd uponas the prince of buffoons. . 
The readers are vex'd to think that a man, 
who was mafter of fo much wit, Ihpuld

have made fo wretched an ufe of it. He is 
an intoxicated philofophcr, who never writ 
but when he was in liquor. 

Dean Swift is Rabelais in his fenfes, 
and frequenting the politeft company. The 
former indeed is not fo gay as the latter, 
but then he poffeffes all the delicacy, the 
juftnefs, the choice, the good tafte, in all 
which particulars our gigling rural vicar 
Rabelais is wanting. The poetical num^ 
bers of Dean Swift are of a Angular and al- 
moft inimitable tafte -, true humour, whe- 
ther in profe or verfe, feems to be his pe- 
culiar talent; but whoever isdefirousof un- 
derftanding him perfeftly, muft vifit the 
ifland in which he was born. 

*TwiLL be much eafier for you to form 
an idea of Mr. Pope^s works. He is, in my 
opinion, the moft elegant, the moft cor- 
reft poet ; and at the fame time the moft 
harmonious (acircumllance which redounds 
very much to the honour of this, mnfe) 
that England ever gave birth to. He has 
mellowed the harfh founds of the Englijh 
trumpet to the foft accents of the flute. 
His compofitions may be eafily tranflated, 
becaufe they are vaftly clear and perfpicu-

XTEITHER the E^Ufi^ nor anf 
J^\| other people, have foundations efta- 
blilh*d in favour of the polite arts like thofe 
in France. There arc univcrfitics in molV 
countries, but ^is in France only that we* 
jmeet with fo beneficial an encouragement 
for aftronomy, and all parts of the mathe- 
maticks, for phyfick, for rcfearches into 
antiquity, for painting, fculpture and ar- 
chitcftur^. Lewis the fourteenth has im- 
mortalized his name by thefe feveral foun- 
dations, and this immortality did not coll 
him two hundred thoufand livres a year. 

I MUST confcfs, that one of the things 
I very much wonder at, is; that as the par- 
liament of Great Britain h^t promifed a 
reward of twenty thoufand pounds Ster-- 
ling to any perfon who may difcover the 
longitude they Ihould never have once 
thought to imitate Lewis the fourteenth in 
his munificence with regard to the arts and 
fciences. Merix

Merit indeed meets in England with 
rewards of another kind, which redound 
more to the honour of the nation. The 
Englift) have fo great a veneration for ex- 
alted talents, that a man of merit in their 
country is always fure of making his for- 
tune. Mr. Addifon in Fr^ce would have 
been clefted a member of one of the aca- 
demies, and, by the credit of fome wo- 
men, might have obtained a yearly penfion 
of twelve hundred livres ; or elfe might 
have been imprifoned in the Baftile^ upon 
pretence that certain ftrokesin his Tragedy 
of Cato had been difcover'd, which glancM 
at the porter of fome man in power. Mr, 
Addifon was rais*d to the pofl: of fecretary of 
ftaie in England. Sir Ifaac Newton was 
m'Sffe warden of the royal mint. Mr. Con- 
greve had a conlklerable * employment. 
Mr. Prior was plenipotentiary. Dr. Swifi 
is Dean of St. Patrick in Dublin^ and is 
more revered in Ireland than the primate 
himfelf. The religion, which Mr. Pope 
profefles, excludes him indeed from pre-

LETTER XXIV^ 

ON THE 

Royal Society, 

AND 

OTHER ACADEMIES. 



THE Efiglijh had an Academy of Scr- 
enccs many years before us ; but then 
it is not under fuch prudent regulations as 
ours : The only re^on of which very pof- 
fibly is, becaufe it was founded before the 
Academy of Paris i for had it been found- 
ed after, it yrould very probably have a- 
dopted forac erf the fage laws of the for- 
mer, and improved upon others. 

Two things, and thofe the moft efleOr 
tial to- man, are wanting in the Royal So- 
ciety of London, I mean rewards and laws. 
A feat in the Academy zt Paris is a finall 
but fecure fortune to a Geometrician or a 
Chemift ; but this is fo far from being the 
cafe at London^ that the feveral members 

of 



i84 Lbtteri Mfcmdfig 

of the Royal Society are at a continual^ 
tho' indeed fmall expence. Any man in 
EngUnd who declares himfelf a lover of the 
mathematicks and natural philofophy, and 
cxpreflcs an inclination to be a member of 
the Royal Society, is immediately elefted 
into it*. But in France 'tisT not enough 
that a man 'Who afbires to the honour of 
being a member or the academy, and of 
receiving the royal ftipend^ has a love for 
the fciences ; he muft at the lame time be 
deeply skill'd in them ; and is oblig'd to 
difpute the feat wth Competitors who are 
fo much the more formidable as they are 
fir'd by a pripcipk of glory, by intereft, by 
the diflkiilty itfelf, and by that inflexibility 
of mind, which is generally found hi thofe 
who devote themfclves to that pertinacious 
ftudy, the mathematicks. 

The Academy of Sciences is prudently 
confined to the ftudy of nature, and, in- 
deed, this is a field fpacious enough for fif- 
ty or threefcore perfons to range in. That 
of London mixes indifcriminately literature 
with phyficks: but methinks tht founding

were written aboat 1728 or 30, fmce which time the 
names of the feveral candidates are, by a law of th«

may be made of fuch perfons only as are qoalified to 
be membera. The celebrated Mr. sle Fomen^lU had

an Academy merely for the polite arts is 
more judicious, as it prevents confufion, 
and the joining, in.fome meafure, of he- 
terogerieals, fuch as a diflertation on the 
head-drefles of the Roman ladies, with an 
hundred or more new curves. 

As there is very litde order and regula- 
rity in the Royal Societv, and not the leaft 
encouragement ; and ttiat the Academy of 
Paris is on a quite diiHerent foot, *tis no 
wonder that our tranfadions are drawn up 
in a more juft and beautiful manner than 
thofe of the Efigli{h. Soldiers who are 
under a regular difcipline, and befides well 
paid, muft: necefj&rily, at laft, perform 
more glorious atchievements than others 
who are mere volunticrs. It muft indeed 
, be confefs'd that the Royal Society boaft. 
their Newton^ but then he ctid not owe his 
knowledge and difcoveries to that body ; fo 
far from it, that the latter were intelligible 
to very few of his fellow-members. A 
genius like that of Sir Ifaac belonged to all 
the academies in the world, becau^ all had . 
a thoufand things to learn of him.

glory (rfthat body to a great height, even 
in its infency. But Queen Anne being 
fnatched fuddenly from the world, the 
Whigs were refolved.to.ruia the-prateaors 
of the intended Academy, a circumftance 
that was of the moft fatal confequence to 
polite literature. The members of this 
Academy would have had a very great 
advantage over thofe who firft formed 
that of the French ; for Swift^ Prior ^ Con-

in this age had the misfortune to be called 
Cbapelain or Cotin^ he would be under a 
neceflity of changing it. 

One circumftance, to which the Englifb 
Academy fhould efpecially have attended, 
is, to have prefcribcd to themfelves occu- 
pations of a quite different kind from thofe 
.with which'our Academicians amufc them- 
felves. A wit of this country alked me for 
.the memoirs of the French Academy. I 
anfwered, they have no memoirs, but have 
printed threefcore or fourfcore volumes in 
quarto of compliments. The gentleman 
perufed one or two of them, but without 
being able to nnderftand the ftyle in which 
they were written, tho* he underftood all 
.our good authors perfcftly . All, fays he, 
I fee in thefe elegant difcourfes is, that the 
member eleft having affured the audience 
that his predeceflbr was a great man, that 
cardinal Richelieu was a very great man, 
that the chancellor Seguier was a pretty 
great man, that Lewis the fourteenth was 
a more than great man ; the director an- 
fwers in the ..very fame drain, and adds, 
that the member eleft may alfo be a fort 
of great man, and that himfelf, in quality 
of direftor, muft alfo have fome fhare in 
this greatnefs.

HISTORY Of CHARLES-Xn. 

Paris, April 25, 1733. 

THE great difficulty we have in 
France of getting books from HoU 
land^ is the reafon why the ninth tome of 
the BiMiotbeque Raifmnie came but late to 
my hands. And I will obferve by the way, 
that if the reft of the journal is equal to the 
pieces I have perufed in it, it is a misfor- 
tune for our men of letters in France^ that 
they are not acqusunted with that work. 

In page 496, part IL of the ninth 
tome abovementioned, I found a letter 
in which I am accufed of a^crfing the city 
of Himiurgb in the Hiftorj of Charles the 
twelfth.- 

A few days fince one Mr. Richey t£ 
Hamhurghy a fcholar and a man of merit, 
having honoured me with a vifit, revived 

the 



ti>i Burmng of Atrts a. 293 

the complaint I juft now mentioned in the 
suune 01 his fellow-citizens. 

Here follows the relation I gave, aiid 
vhat I myielf am obliged to declare. 
In the heat of the unhappy war which 
made fb dreadful a havock in the North, 
the Counts of Sieinbock and of fVelling^ the 
Swedifi Generals, formed/ ^/^//^ 171 3> in 
the very city of Hamlmrgbj a refolution to 
burn JUteiMy a trading city, and fubjci^ 
to the Danes ; for the commerce of this 
city began to flourifli fo much, that the 
Hatniurgbers grew a little jealous of it. 

. This refolution was executed unmerci- 
fully in the night of the ninth of January. 
Thefe generals lay in Hamburgh that very 
night; they lay in it the tenth, eleventh, 
twelfth, and thirteenth ; and dated from 
the laft nventioned city the letters they 
wrote to clear themfelves from the impu- 
tation of "being the authors of fo barbarous 
acataftrophe. 

'Tis befides certain, and the Hamburgh^ 
ers themfelves do not deny it, that the 
gates of their city were fhut againft feve- 
ralof the inhabitants oi Aliena-y againft old 
men, and women near theii^ time, who 
came to implore an afylum ; and that fe- 
veral of thefe unhappy wretches expired 
under the walls of Hamburgh^ frozen with 
cold, and opprcfled with mifcry, at the 
fame time that their country was burnt to 
alh.s. K I 



«94- ^ LETTtk cdncermn^ 

I was obliged to infert thefe particiHart 
in the hiftory of Charles the twelfth. One 
of the Perfons, who furnilhed me with ma- 
terials, declares in his letter, in the moft 
pofitive terms, that the Hamburghers had 
given Count Steinbock a fuoi of money, in 
order to engage him to deftroy Altenay as 
feeing their rival in trade. 

I did not lK)wever adopt fo grievous an 
accufation. What reafon foever I may 
have to be convinced of the great depra- 
vity of mankind, I yet was never fo cre- 
dulous with regard to crimes. I have 
combated, and that efficacioufly, more 
than one calumny •, and am even the only 
mafi who dared to juftify the memory of 
Count Piper^ by arguments, at the time 
that all Eurvpe flandered him by cofi- 
jeftures. 

Instead therefore of following the 
account which had been communicated to 
me, I contented myfelf with relating, 
"That it was reported^ fome Hamburghers 
"had given a fum of money fccretly to Count 
•Steinbock. This report became univerfal, 
and was founded on appearances. An 
^liftorian is allowed to infert reports as well 
as fadts, and when he publifhes a general 
report, an opinion, merely as an opinion, 
and not as truth, he is neither refponfiblc 
for it, nor ought to be accufed in any man- 
ner

ner for fo doing. But when he is infofrA^d 
that this popular opinion is falfe and ilan^ 
derous, it is then his duty to declare it, 
and to thanlc, in a puMic manner, thofe 
who have undeceived him^ 

This is exaclly my cafe. - Ml-. Richey 
has proved to me the innocence of his 
fellow citizens, and the Biblotbejue liii- 
fonme^ has alfo very folidly refused the accq- 
farion levelled agaifift the cxijoi H:mkirgh. 
The authot of t^e letter againft ni^, is only 
to blame for ikying that I pofitiveiy aflcrt- 
cd that the city of Hamburgh was cruilty ; 
but he ought to have made a diftinction 
between the opinion of one part of the 
north, which I gave as a vague, random 
report, and the affirmation with which he 
charges me. Had I indeevl d:::clHrcd, 
^hat the city of Hamburgh piirchafei the 
rtUn of the city of Akena, I then would 
have aflced pardon, in the moll humble 
manner for making fuch an affcrti^n, be- 
ing perfuaded that there is no fliame on 
thefe occafions, except to perfill in a fau't 
v^hen it is proved to be fuch. Bjt I de- 
clare the truth, in relating that fuch a report 
was fpread ; and I alio declare thj ti .iih,

know, that the myftery of original fin is the 
objeft of fsith, not of reafon. I very well 
conceive what man is, without difcovering 
any thing myfterious on that occafion. I 
perceive, that he comes into the world like 
other animals; that women of the moft 
delicate conftitutions have the hardeft la-

mong brutes, fometimes lofe their lives on 
thofe occafions ; that, foiuetim.e^, the con- 
ftruction of the organs of ceruin childrea 
is ib dilbrdered, that they pais their lives 
deprived of one or two fenfes, and without 
the enjoyment of the rational faculties ^

that we depend entirely on the air which

that there is nothing inconfiftent or contra-

This pretended duplicity, in man, is 
idea equally abfurd and metaphyseal, 
would be equally juft to aflert, that the 
bg who bites and fawns is double ; that 
he hen who, for fome time, takes care of 
r chicken, and afterwards abandons 
them, is double ; that the mirrour, which 
reprefents different objefts^ is double ; and 
that the tree, which, at one time, is tufted

wholly from its nature. The pride of 
every individual among the Jews prompts 
him to believe, that he does not owe his 
ruin to his deteftable politicks, his ignorance 
of the polite arts,' and his rufticity ; but 
that the wrath of God punifhcs him. He 
finds a pleafure in reflefting that it was ne- 
ceflary before he could be humbled, to 
have recourfe to miracles ; and that thofe 
of his perfuafion, tho* punifhed by the Al- 
mighty, are yet his darling people. 

Should a preacher go up into the pulpit, 
and addrefs the French m manner following: 
you are a parcel of cowardly^ ignorant feU 
lowSy and were heat at Hochftet and Ra- 
milies, merely hecaufeyou did not know how to 
make a proper defence : the preacher^ I fay^ 
would get his brains knocked out. But fhould 
he fpeak thus : " You are Catholicks, and, 
** for that reafon beloved by heaven. The 
** enormity o£ your fins had drawn down 
** upon you the wrath of God, who 
•* therefore gave you up to the hereticks 
** at Hochftet and Ramilies -, but when you 
*' turned to the Lord, he gave his bene- 
*' diftion to your courage at Denain.** 
Such a fpeech as this would win him the 
afFeftion of his auditors.

It is incumbent on man to love, and 
that with the utmoft tendernefs, the crea- 
tures : it is incumbent on him to love his 
country, his wife, and his children ; and 
this love is fo inherent that the Almighty 
forces a man, fpite of himlelf, to love 
them. To argue upon contrary principles 
would be a barbarous way of xcafoning.

This fclt-love with Which nature iias iti-

this been the cafe, merchants would have 
traded to the Indits merely from a -princi-

lawed ftone, with no other view but to ferve 
his neighbour. But God has fettled thlri^

XIII. 

The time of Chrift's fecond coming was 
foretold in a ftill dearer manner than the 
firft: In all probability it dipt Mr. Pafchal's 
memory, thaf Chrift, in chap xxi. of St. 
Luke^ declares exprefly thus, 

"And when ye Ihall fee Jerufalem 
** encompafled with armies, then know 
** that the defolatron thereof is nigh.— And 
** there fhall be figns in the fun, and in 
" the mpon, and in the ftars ; and upon

** - —For the powers of heaven will be 
" ihaken.-And then fha!l they fee the fon 
** of man coming in a cloud with power 
*' and great glory.** 

Have not we here a clear prophecy 
with regard t<* Chrift's fecond coming ? but 
if this be an event that is yet to come, it 
would argue great prefumption in us to en- 
quire of providence concerning it.

This . article is rather a fatyrical fling, 
than a Chriftian refleftion. 'Tis plain that 
the Jefuits arc leveled at here. But was 
any Je/uit ever known to aflcrt, that Chrift 
came into the world to exempt us from loving 
God ? The controverfy concerning loving 
God is a mere conteft about words, like 
moft of thefe fcientifical quarrels whence 
fuch ftrong animofities, fuch fatal calami^ 
ties, have fprung. There is another de- 
fefkalfo in this article: I mean the author's 
fuppofing that the expeftation of a Meflias 
was confidercd by the Jews as an article of 
their religion, whereas it was only a conibla- 
tory refleftion which prevailed among them. 
The Jews hoped a redeemer would come ^ 
but then they were not obliged to believe 
this, as an article of faith. Their whole 
tdigion was comprized in the book of the

feJUid of Nofirums^ fo as frequently to entruft 
their lives in their hands ^ I imagined that the 
true caufe of this is, there being fuch things 
as true medicines in the w^rld\ for it would 
be impofftble that there fhould be fo many fpu- 
rious ones J or fo much credit given to themy 
if there were no genuine. Had there never 
been any fucb^ and that all difeafes in general . 
bad been incurable, 'tis impojjtble mankind 
could have imagined that there are any in na- 
ture; andJUll more, that fo many multitudes 
of people fl)Ould have uiven credit to thofe who 
bva/led their being poffeffed of fuch medicines. 
TFas a perfon to pretend, that he had got a 
fecrvt which would preferve people from the 
grave, no one would believe him, becanfe 
there have been no examples of this. But as 
a great number of medicines have bee)i found 
genuine, from the experience of the great eft 
men, this circumffance won the belief of man- 
kind. For, as, the thing could not be denied 
in general, becaufe fome particular effects 
have been found true\ the vtilgar, who are 
not able to find out, among thefe particular 
effeSls, which are the true ones, therefore 
give credit to them all. In like manner, 
the reafon why fo many falfe effcSs cf the 
Moon are believed, is, becaufe there are fome 
true ones, fuch as the ebbing and fiovAng of 
the fea.

\fbe JoU reafon why there are fo many falf

neccflarily, in order for their crediting 
what is falfe, to be acquainted with what 
is true. People afcribed a thoufand falle 
influences to the Moon, before the leaft 
true relation, to the ebbing iind flowing 
•of the fea, was thought on.' The firlt 
man who found himfelf fick, eafily gave 
credit to the firft quack he met with. No 
one ever faw a hobgoblin, or wizard, and yet 
many believed there were fuch beings : no 
man was ever an eye-witnefs to the tranf- 
mutation of metals, and yet many have 
been ruined by their believing what is cal- 
led the Philofopher's ftone. Did the Greeks^ 
the Romansy and the Heathens'^ give credit 
to the falfe miracles, of which they had 
numberlefs multitudes, for no other rea- 
fon, but becaufe they had been Ipeftators 
of true ones ?

A SIMILE or comparifon is no proof 
either in verfe or pfofe. In poetry it ferves 
as an embellifliment ; andinprofe, itiiluf- 
trates things, and makes them ftrike more • 
fenfibly upon us. Such poets as have com- 
pared the misfortunes of perfons in exalted 
ftations, to thunder breaking upon moun- 
tains, would draw quite oppofite compa- 
rifons, if the contrary happened in nature. >

If wc knew what it is in which the 
mind confifts, wc then might juftly com- 
plain of philofophcrs, for afcribing fuch 
things to it as arc quite foreign ; but we 
are not acquainted either with the mind or 
body. We have not the kaft idea of the 
one \ and our ideas, with regard to the 
other are vaftly imperfeft : confequently

and yet we dorCt fay foy the reafon of which is^ 
we know very well what is the objeSl of geo-

we do not know what that is in which the 
charm or beauty confifts^ which is the objtS 
of poetry. We do not know what this natural 
model which we^ ought to imitate^ ij; emdy 
for want of this knowledge, certain odd terms 
have been invented, as golden age, miracle 
of our time, fatal laurel, beautiful ftar, Csf r. 
and this jargon is called poetical beauty. But 
any man who fhaU figure to himfelf a woman
