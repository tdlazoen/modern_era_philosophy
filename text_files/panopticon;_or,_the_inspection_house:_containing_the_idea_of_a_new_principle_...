capable of applications of the mod extenfive nature ; 
and that for reafons which you will foon perceive. 
To fay all in one word, it will be found appli- 
cable, I think, without exception to all eftablilh- 
ments whatfoever, in which within a (pace not too 
large to be covered or commanded by buildings, a 
number of perfons are meant to be kept under 
infpedtion. No matter how different, or evqn op- 
pofite the purpafe: whether it be, that of puni/h- 
ing'jhe incorrigible, guarding the infane, reforming 
the vicious^ confining the fufpeftcd, employing the idle 9

LETTER II. 



Plan for a Penitentiary Infpe&ion- 
Houfe. 

BEFORE you look at the plan, take in words 
the general idea of it. 
The building is circular. 
Th* apartments of the prifoners -occupy the cir- 
cumference. - You may call them, if you pleafe, 
the Cells. 

Thefe Cells* are divided from one another, and 
the prifoners by that means fecluded from all com- 
munication with each other, by partitions in the 
form of radii iffuing from the circumference to* 
wards the center, and extending as many feet as 
fbalL be thought neceflary to form the largeft dw 
menfionof thfrCclL 

The apartment of the lnfpe£tor occupies the 

center j. you may call it if you pleafe the Infpeclvr*s 

Hedge. 

* It will be^onvenient in moft, iifiot in all cafes, 

to have a vacant fpace or area all round, between

fuch center and fuch circumference. You may 
call it if you pfeafe the Intermediatt or Annular 
Area. 

About the width of a Cell may be fuffictent for 
a fafjage fir6rft the outfide of the building to the 
Lodge. 

Each Cell has in the outward circumference, * 
window, large enough, not only to light the Cell,, 
but, through the Cell, to afford light enough fc> 
the correfpondent part of the Lodge* 

The inner circumference of the Cell is formed 
by an iron grating, fo light as not to fcreen any 
part of the Cell from the Infpe&or's view. 

Of this grating a part Efficiently large opens, inv 
fbnrf of a datr,. to admit the prHbner at his firft en- 
trance ; and to give admiflion at any time to the- 
Inipeftor or any of his attendants. 

To cut off from each prifoner the view ©f every 
ether, the partitions ate carried on a few feet be- 
yond the grating into the Intermediate Area ; fuch« 
proje&ing pahs I calf the Protracted Partitions \. 

It is coltceived, that the light, coming in, ifr 
this manner through the Cells, and lb acrofs the 
lriterrtiediaib Area, Will be Sufficient for thelnfpec- 
'ter's Lbdge; But, fbr this purpdfe, bbtfc ttte win-

dows in the cells, and tbofe correfponding to t^em 
in the Lodge, fliovild, be as large as the Itr^gth of 
the building, and what fliall be deemed a neceflary 
attention to economy, will permit. 

To the windows of the Lodge there are blinds f 
as high up as the eyes of the prifoners in their Cells 
can, by any means they can employ, be made t^ 
reach. 

To prevent thorough light, whereby notwith- 
standing the blinds, the prifoners wou Id fee from 
the Cells whether or no any perfon was in the 
lodge, that apartment is divided into quarters, by 
partitions formed by two diameters to the circle, 
crofling each other at right angles, • For thefe 
partitions the thinneft materials might ferve ; and 
they might be made removeable at pleafure - T their 
height, fufficient to prevent the prifoners feeing 
over them from the cells. Doors to thefe parti- 
tions, if left open at any time, might produce the 
thorough light: To prevent this, divide each 
partition into two, at any part required, fetting 
down the one-half, at fuch diftance from the 
other, as fhall be equal to the aperture of a

the Cells. 

Small lamps) in the outfide of each window df 
the Lodge, backed 1 by a refledtop, ta throw the 
light into the correfponding Cells, would extend 
to the night the fecurity of the day. 

To fave the trqublefome exertion of voice, that 
might otherwife be neceffary, and to prerent one 
prifoner from knowing, that the Infpe&OF was oc- 
cupied by another prifoner at a diftance y a fmall 
tin tube might reach from each Cell to the Jnfpec- 
tor's Lodge, paffing acrofsthe Area, and fo in, at 
the fide of the correfpondent window of the Lodge. 
By means of this implement, the flighted whifper 
of the one might be heard by the other, efpecially 
if he had proper notice to apply his ear to the 
tube. 

With regard to injlrufliwi, in cafes where it 
cannot be duly given without the inftruftor's be- 
ing clofe to the work, or without fetting his hand 
to it by way of example before the learner's face,

workmen without quitting his central -ftation in 
the Lodge ; and, on the other, the confufionr which 
would enfue, if different inftru6tors, orperfonsiii 
the' Lodge, were catting to the*Cells at the fame 
time. And, in the cafe of hofpitals, the quiet that 
may Be infured by this ftttle contrivance, trifling 
as it may ieem at firft fightv affords an additional 
advantage. 

A W/ appropriated excltifively to the purpofcs

ing is crowned, communicating by a. rope, with 
the Infpe&or's Lodge.

4M ariotifefc TKi Wfnjs; the caff, I can fee no other eligible 
means, than that of having in each Cell a Art provlfion made for 
this purpof* in the eonftrudHon of the building. 

Betwixt €v€ty other two Celh^at tfie end of the partition which 
divide* them, a hollow fhaft or tunnel is left in the brick-work 
•f the exterior watt} which tunnel, if there be ftveral ftories to 
the building, is carried up through all of them. 

Into this tunnel is infested under each Cell, the bottom of art 
* art hen vive (like the fe applied in England to the tops of 
chimneys} glazed in the infide. The upper end, opening into 
the Gfifi, is covered by a feat of caft-iron, bedded into the brick 
work ; with an aperture, which neither by its file nor fliape, 
ihatt be capable of admitting the body of a man. To gain the 
tunnel from the infide of the Cell, the portion of this pipe will 
of courfe be flanting. At the bottom of the tunnel, on the out- 
fide of the building, an arched opening, fo low as fcarcely to be 
difcernible, admits of the filth being carried away. No one, who 
has been at all attentive to the hiftory of prifons, but muft have 
obferved, how often e (capes have been effected or attempted 
through this channel. 

A flight (Screen, which the prifoner might occafionally Inter- 
pofe, may perhaps not be thought faperrtuous. This, whiloie 
anfwers the purpofe of decency, might be fo adjufted as to pre* 
vent his concealing from the eye of the Infpe&or any forbidden. 
enterprise. 

For each Cell, the* whole apparatus would not come to many 
flwllings r a fmall confideration for a great degree of fecurity. In 
this manner, without any relaxation of the discipline, the ad- 
vantages of cleanlinefii, and its- concomitant health, may boat* 
sained to as great a degree as in mofr private houfes .

The clear expence would, however, not be quite fo great as it

As to this individual building of my brother's, 
-the dimenfions jof it were determined by the con* 
fideration of the moft convenient fcantlings of the 
timbers (that toepng in his Htuat;ion the cheapeft 
material) and by other local considerations. It is 
to have two ftories, and the diameter of the whole 
building is to be ioo feet out and out. 

Merely to help conception, i will take this fize 
for an example of fuch a building ^s he vroujd pro- 
jjpofe for £nglajid. 

Taking the diameter top feet, this admits of 
.48 Cells, 6 feet wide each at the outride, walls in- 
cluded: with zj>ajfage through tjhe bv^ilding of 8

cending flights, joined to the defccnding, enable die 
fervants of the houfe to go to the upper ftory of 
the Cells, without palling through the apartment 
of the Infpe&or. 

As to die height of the whole, and of the feve- 
ral parts, it is fuppofed that 18 feet might ferve for 
the two Jlories of Cells, to be infpeited, as above, by 
one Jlory of the Lodge : This would hold 96 pcr- 
fons: 

36 feet for four ftories of Cells, and two of the 
Lodge : this would hold 192 perfons: 

54 feet for fix ftories of the Cells, and three of 
the Lodge : this would hold 288 perfons : 

And 54 feet, it is conceived, would not be an 
immoderate elevation. 

The drawings which, I believe, will accompany 
this, fuppofe/wr for the number of ftories of the 
Cells.

You will fee, under the head of Hofpitals/the 
reafons why- 1 conceive that even a kfs height thafi 
9 feet, dedu&ing the thicknefs of a floor fupported 
by arches, mightbe fufficient for the Cells. 

The paffkge might have, for its height* either 
the height of one ftory, or of two (lories of the 
Cells, according as the number of thofe Cells was 
two or four. The part over die paffage might, in 
either cafe, be added to the. Lodge, to which it 
would thereby give a communication, at each end* 
with the world without doors, and enfure a -keeper 
againft the danger of finding himfelf a« prifonef 
among his prifoners. 

Should it be thought that, in this way, the 
Lodge would not have light enough, for the conve- 
nience of a man of a ftation- competent 4 to the 
office, the deficiency might be fupplied, by a void 
Tpace, left in that part, ail the way up. Yoa may 
call it if you pleafe the Central Ana., Into this 
fpace windows may open, where they are wanted, 
from the apartments of the Lodge. It may be 
either left open at the top or covered with a Jky- 
light. But this expedient, though it might add*, in 
fome refpefts, to the convenience of the Lodge

could not but add considerably to the quantity and 
expence of the building. 

On the other hand it would be aififtant to ven- 
tilation. Here too would be a proper place for 
the Chapel: the Prifoners remaining in their Cells ; 
and the windows of the Lodge, which fsalmoft all 
window, being thrown open. The advantages 
derivable from it in point of light and ventilation 
depending upon its being kept vacant, it can never 
be wanted for any profane trie. It may therefore 
with the greater propriety be allotted to divine fer- 
vice and receive a. regular confederation. The pul- 
pit and founding -board may be moveable. During 
the term of fervice, the fty-light, at all other times, 
kept as open as poflible, might be fhut.

moft Jimple form. A few more with regard to what 
further extenjions it may admit of.

The Principle extended to uncwtrei Areas, a i 

lery the /the field of Infaecli** might be dilated to 
any extent. 

If the number of mtundas were extended tQ 
four a regular uncovered area might in that way 
be inclofed: and, being furrounded by covered . 
Galleries, would be commanded in this manner 
from all fides, inftead of being commanded only 
from one. 

, The Area thus inclofed might be. either circular, 
like the buildings, or fquare> or abhug, as one or 
other of thole forms were baft adapted to the pre* 
vailing ideas of beauty *or local convenience- A 
chain of any length, eompefed of infpe£tion^bouie$ 
adapted to the lame or different purpofes, might 
in this way be carried round an acea of any extent. 

On fuch a plan, either one Impe&or might 
ferve for two or more rotundas, or, if there were 
one to each, 4he infoeftivejst&i if I may ufe the 
expreffion, would be greater in fuch a Gpnapound 
building than in any of the number, fmgiy /taken, 
of which it was eompofed: fince each Infpe&or

Many writers have expatiated, with great force 
and , juftice, on the unpopular and unedify ing caft 
ofthatundiftinguifliingdifcipline, which, in fitu- 
atton and treatment, confounds the lot of thofe 
who ma prove innocent with the lot of thofe who 
have been proved to be guilty. The fame Toof, 
it has been faid, ought not to indofe perfons, who 
{land in predicaments fo diffimilar. In a combina- 
tion of Infpe&ion-houfes, this delicacy might be 
obferved, without any abatement of that vigilance 
with regard to fafe-cuftody, which in both cafes is 
jetjually indifpenfahle.

this circumftance that renders the influence of this

to neceffary coercion; not lefs powerful as a cpn-

Againft efcapes, and in particular on the part of 
Felons of every defcription, as well before as after 
convhSkion, perfons from the defperatenefs of whofe 
iituation attempts to efcape are more particularly 
to be apprehended, it would afford, as I dare fay 
you fee already, a degree of fecurity, which perhaps 
has been fcarce hitherto reached by conception, 
much lefs by pra&ice. Overpowering the guard 
requires an union of hands, and a concert among 
minds. But what union, or what concert, can 
there be among perfons, no one of whom will have 
fet eyes on any other from the firft moment of his 
entrance ? Undermining walls, forcing iron bars 
requires commonly a concert, always a length of 
time exempt from interruption. But who would 
think of beginning a work of hours ajnd dayi, 
without any tolerable profpeft of making fo muck 
as the firft motion towards it unobferved ?— Such 
attempts have been feldom made without the affift- 
ance of implements introduced by accomplices 
from without. But who would expofe them-

I AM come now to the article of pecuniary Eco- 
nomy ; and as this is the great rock upon which 
the original Penitentiary-Plan, I underftand has 
fplit, I cannot refift the temptation of throwing 
out a few hints relative to the mode of manage- 
ment, which I look upon as the moft eligible in 
this view ; but which could not, as you will fee, 
have been eftablifhed with any thing like the ad- 
vantage, upon any other ground than that of my 
brother's infpe&ion principle. 

To come to the point at once, I would do the 
whole by contracl. I would farm out the profits,

who, being in other refpe&s unexceptionable, of-

new in its extent, in the defcription of the perfons 
to be fubje&ed to his management, and in many 
other circumftances, his fuccefs in it, if he does 
fucceed, may be regarded in the light of an inven- 
tion ; and rewarded accordingly, juft as fuccefs in 
other inventions is rewaded, by the profit which 
a monopoly fecured by patent enables a man to 
make ; and that in proportion to the fuccefs which 
conflitutes their merit. He fhould have it during 
g$$d behaviour : which you know is as much as to 
fay, unlefs fpecific inftances of mifbehaviour fla- 
grant enough to render his removal expedient be 
proved on him in a legal way, he (hall have it for 
his life. Befides that when thus fecured he can 
afford to give the better price for his bargain, you 
will prefcntly fee more material reafons, to coun-. 
terbalance the feeming unthriftinefs of granting 
him a term, which may prove fo long a one. . It\

though die rate of intereft were much below the 
Ordinary one : the difference, between fuch reduc-

fKtute the whole of the expence which the public

this at die long run ; or, indeed with any part of 
it. But of this hereafter. 

In the next place I would give my contra&or 
all the powers that his intereft could prompt him 
to wifh for, in order to enable him to make the 
moil of his bargain ; wkh only foroe flight referva- 
tions, which I will mention afterwards ; for very 
flight ones you will find they will be, that can be 
needful or even ferviceatbk in the view of prevent- 
ing abufe. 

But, the greater latitude be has in taking fuch 
meafures, the lefs will he grudge the letting it be 
known, what the meafures are which he Joes 
take ; knowing, at tlie fame time, that no advan- 
tage can be taken of fuch knowledge, hy turning 
him out in cafe of his fucecfs, and putting in ano- 
ther to reap the fruits* of his contrivance. I wiH 
then require him to Jifckfc, and even to print and 
fubli/b t his accounts:— ^the whole pfocds and de- 
tail of his management: — the whole hiftory of the 
prifon. 1 will require him, I iay, on pain of for- 
feiture or other adequate punifhment, to pubMi 
thefe accounts, and that upon oath. I have no 
fear of his not pablifhingycwur accounts, becaufe, 
if the time iselapfed and fame accounts not pub-

lifted, a fift not liable to difpute the punifhmcnt 
takes place of courfe ; and I have not much fear 
that the accounts when publifhed will not be true : 
becattfe, having power to do every thing that is 
for his advantage, there is nothing which it is his 
intereft to conceal : and the intereft which the 
^mnifhment for perjury gives him not to conceal is 
manifeft ; more efpecially as I make him examin- 
able and crofs-examinable viva voa upon oath at 
any time. 

It is for clearing away as much as poflible, every 
motive of pecuniary intereft, that could prompt 
Aim to throw any kind of cloak or referve upon 
any of his .expedients for encreafing his profits, 
/that 1 would enfure them to him for lift. 

From -the information thus got from him, I de- 
rive this advantage. In the cafe of his ill focccfs, 
I fee the caufes of it ,, and not only I, but every 
body elfe that pleafes, may fee the caufes of it ; 
and amongft the reft, thofe who, in cafe of their 
taking management out of his hands, would have 
an intereft in being acquainted with fuch cauies, 
*in order to obviate or avoid -diem. More than 
,that, if his illfuccefs is owing to incapacity, and 
-that incapacity fuch as, if continued, might raife 

my 



»y ^expcnce -above the calculation, 1 can make 
him u ftep in time ; a meafure, to which he can 
have as Mttle objection as myfelf ; for it is one ad* 
vantage of this plan, that whatever mifchief hap- 
pens mail have more than eat out all his profits be- 
fore it reaches me* 

In the cafe df his good fuccefs, I fee the caufts 
t>f that too ^and every body fecsthem, as'before ; 
and, amongft others, all perfons who could propofe

t*ge to put them to, and what it is therefore moft 
likely he fhould be difpofed to put them to. 

That he * may get the better view of them, 
throw them into four claffes. In xhcfr/i % I place 
thofe, who already are poffeffed of bufineffes ca«- 
pable of being carried on with advantage, in the 
prifon : in the feconiL, thofe trained up to bufineffes 
which, though not capable in themfclves of being 
carried on within fuch limits, yet by the fimilarity 
of operation have a tendency to render it more or 
lefs eafy for a man to learn fome of thofe other bufi- 
neffes which are ; in the third rank, I would place 
fiich as had been trained up indeed to induftry, 
but to branches which have no fuch tendency as I 
have juft mentioned ; fiich for inftance r as porters, 
.coal-heavers, gardeners, and hufbandmen. In 
the Iaft I would place men. regularly brought up 
to the profeffion of thieving, and others who have 
never been, brought up to, any kind of. induftry. 
Some names for thefe different claffes I may as 
well endeavour to find as not: for names they 
muft have when they get. into their, houfe ; and,

the</raw/j. As to the capable hands; they will, of 
courfe, be the more valuable, the Dearer the bud- 
nefies they understand approach to thofe of the 
^Wones ; in other words* the left difficulty there 
would be in teaching the latter the bufinefs of the 
former. The fame observation of courfe applies 
to the promi/htg hands ; in as far as the advantage 
which the one pofflbfs by habit the others may ap- 
pear to poffefs by difpofition. Lower down in the 
fcale of detail I will not attempt to lead you. 

You have a very pretty law in England, for en- 
riching the country, by keeping boys backward, 
and preventing men from following the trades they 
could getrnoft by. If I were jealous of Ruffia's 
growing too rich, and being able to buy too many 
of our goods, I would try to get fuch a law as that 
introduced among thefe ftupid people here, who 
have never yet had the fenfe to think of any fuch 
thing. Having no fuch jcaloufy againft any 
country, much lefs againft my own Utopia, I 
would beg that law might be banifhed from with- 
in my walls. I fancy my. contractor would be as 
well pleafed with its room as its company ; and as 
the fame indulgence has been granted to other per- 
sons

be entertained, fuch as foldiers and failors, I have 
bo great fear the indulgence would be denied me* 
Much I believe, is not apprehended, in that way, 
from the red-coats and jack-tars ; and Hill lefs, 
I believe, would be apprehended from my heroes. 
v This (tumbling block cleared away, thefirft 
thing, I imagine my contractor would do, would 
be to fet to work his good hands ; to whom he 
would ^dd as many of his capable hands as he could 
mufter. 

With his pomifing hands and his drones, he 
would fet up a manufacture. What then 4halk 
this manufacture be ?■ — If may be this, and that, and

if thocorifideration of punifhment, with its ap 
pendage of reformation/ had kept the other of 
economy a little behind the curtain. But I nei- 
ther fee the great danger, nor the great harm of a 
man's liking his work too -wdil : and how well fp- 
ever he might have liked it elfewhere, I (hould 
ftill lefs apprehend his liking -the thought of hav- 
ing it to do then. Suppofing no fage regulations 
made by any body to nail them to this or that fort 
of work, the work they would naturally fall upon 
under the hands of a contractor would be that, 
whatever it might be, by which there was moft 
money to be made ; for the more the prifoner- 
workman got, the more the mafter could get out 
of him; fo that upon that point I (hould have 
little fear of their not agreeing. Nor do I fee why 
labour {hould be the lefs reforming for being pro- 
fitable. On the contrary, among working men*,

to have pot in his hapds, as a means of perfnading

Judge is to prefume them all honeft till he is 
forced to fufpedt the contrary : the bufinefs of the 
law is, to conclude them all without exception, to 
be the gfeateft knaves and villains that can be ima- 
gined. My contractor, therefore, I makemyfelf

courfe, all whom he could not make pay for their 
board, together with fomething for his trouble. 
But asT fhould get nothing by this economy, and 
might lofefome credit by it, I have no mind it

a want of inducements adequate to that purpofe. 

If after all it ihould be infilled, that fome power 
of corre&ion would be abfoktely neceflary, for 
inftance, in the cafe of a prifoner's affaufting a

word is fufficient, after what I have faid in consi- 
dering the general heads of advantage dependent on 
this principle. Other checks afliftant to this are 
obvious enough. A corre&ion-hoi might be kept 
in which every inflance of chaftifement, with the

But, befides preventing his ftarving them or ufing

will die fafter than honeft men. Say therefore one 
in twenty, though I believe, as jails ftand at prefent, 
if no more than one in ten die, or for aught I 
know out of a much fmaller number, it may be 
thought very well. Give the contra&or then for 
every man that ought to die, for ihftance ten pounds : 
that funr, repeated for every man in twenty among 
three hundred will amount to a hundred and fifty 
pounds. Upon thefe terms, then, at the end erf" 
the year make him pay ten pounds for every man 
that has a&ually died within that time ; to which 
you inay add or eficaped, and I dare fay he will have 
no ohjjiftion. If by nurfing them and making 
much of them he ihould find himfelf at the end 
of the year a few pounds the richer by his tender- 
nefs, who would grudge it him ? If you have ftill 
any doubt of him, inftead of the ten pounds you 
may put twenty, you will not be much the poorer 
for it. I don't know upon fecond thoughts whether

could be carried on with at leaft equal advantage, 
in a (late of liberty. Both parties would probably 
£nd their account in continuing their imnufa&ur- 
ing connexion, after the difiblution of every other. 
The workman, after the ftigma caft on him by 
the place of his abode, would probably not find it 
fo eafy to get employment elfewhere. If he got it 
at all, it would be upon terms proportioned in 
fome meafure to the rifk which an employer at 
large might think be would run on his own part, 
and in fome cafes to the danger of driving away 
fellow workmen, by the introduction of an aflb- 
ciate who might prove more or lefs unwelcome. 
He would therefore probably come cheaper to his 
former mafter than another man would ; at the 
fame time that he would get more from him in his 
free ftate than he had been ufed to get when con- 
fined. 

Whether this refource was in contemplation

Whatever be the manufa<9fure, the utility of

I do not mean to entertain yoa here with a fyf-

or two on this fubje& you muft permit me. — 
Would the cieiings of the Cell be high enough ? 
•Is the plan of conftru&ion Efficiently favourable 
to ventilation ? I have not the good fortune to 
have read a book publHhed not long ago on the 
fubje& of hofpitals, by our countryman Mr. Aikin ; 
though I remember feeing fomc account of it 
in a Review. But I cannot help lagging of you 
to recommend to the notice of your medical friends 
the perufal of Dr. De Maret\ paper, in the Me- 
moirs of the Academy of Dijon for the year 1782' 
If either his fa&s or his reafoning are to be trufted, 
not only no loftinefe of ceiling is fufficient to enfure 
to fiich a building a purity of air, but it may ap- 
pear questionable whether fuch an effaSt -be upon 
the whole promoted by that circumftance.* 

* To an Hofpitil lately huilt at Lyons a vaft dome had been 
given in this view. It had been expe&ed that the fqul air JhouM 
be found at top, while that near the floor fhould have been f\u ct

His great anxiety feems to be, that at fome 
known period or periods of the day, the whole mafs 
of air may undergo at once a total change, not 
trailing to partial and precarious evacuations by 
opening here and there a window ; ftill lefs to any 
height or other amplitude of room ; a circum- 
ftance which of itfelf tends to render them flill 
more partial and precarious. Profcribing all re&ili- 
near walls and fiat cielings forming angles at the 
jun&ions, he recommends accordingly for the in- 
fide of his building, the form of a long oval, curv- 
ed in every dire&ion except that of the floor, plac- 
ing a door at each end. By throwing open thefe 
doors, he feems to make it pretty apparent, that 
the fmalleft draught will be fufficient to effe& an 
entire change in the whole ftock of air : fince at 
which ever end a current of air happens firll to 
enter, it will carry all before it till it gets to the 
other. Opening windows or other apertures dif- 
pofed in any other part of the room, would tend 
rather to difturb and counteract the current than to 
promote it. 

From the fame reafoning it will follow, that the 
circular form demanded as the beft of all by the in- 
fpe&ion principle, muft in a view to ventilation

have in a confiderable degree the advantage 6ver 
re&Uinear : and even, were the difference fuffici- 
ently material, the infpe&ion principle might be 
applied to his oval with little or no difadvan- 
tage. The form of the Infpe&ion Lodge might 
in this cafe follow that of the containing building ; 
and that central part fo far from otftrucTmg the 
ventilation, would rather as it ihould feem, affift 
it, encreafmg the force of the current by the com- 
preffure. 

It (hould feem alfo, that to a circular building 
the central Lodge would thus give the fame aptitudo- 
to ventilation, which the Doctor's oval form pof-^ 
feffes of itfelf. 

To fave his patients from catching cold while 
the current is pafling through the room, the Doc- 
tor allows to each a fhort fcreen> like the head of a 
cradle, to be refted on the bed. 

Here the ufe of the tin /peaking- tubes would be 
feen again, in the means they would afford to the 
patient, though he were equal to no more than a 
whifper, of conveying to the Lodge the moft im- 
mediate notice of his wants : and receiving an- 
fwcrs in a tone equally unproductive of difturb*' 
ance.

Something I could have wifhed to fay, on the 
important difference between the general and com- 
paratively immaterial imparity refulting merely 
from the phlogifion y and the various particular im- 
purities conftituted by the various produds of pu- 
trefaction, or by the different matters of the vaii^ 
ous contagions. Againft thefe very different dangers 
the mode and meafure of precaution might admit 
of no fmall difference. But this belongs not ne- 
ceflarily to the fubjedt, and you would not thank 
me, any more than gentlemen of the faculty who 
underftand it better than I, or gentlemen at large 
who would not wiih to underftand it.

A Prifo*, as I obferved in a former fetter, in-

fhould it be thought of ufe, a few Cells might be 
appropriated to that purpofe ; and perhaps it may 
be thought advifable that fome cafes of infe&ion 
fhould be throwi* out and ltxlged under another 
roof. 

But if infe&ion in general mud be fent to be

AFTER applying the infpe&ion principle firft

•endure my applying it at laft to Schools ? Will the 
obfervation of its efficacy in preventing the irregu-

Applied to thefe you will find it capable of two

With regard to the extending the range of in-

You may however venture to hint, that the money" 
which is now laid out for propagating controveriyy 
by founding fermons and ledures, might be laid 
out with greater certainty of advantage in the 
founding controverfial Infpeflion-Scbeols. The 
preacher* muft be fad bunglers indeed, if they had 
not there as many adherents as auditors ; which is 
not always the cafe in the world at large. As to* 
flagellation, and other fuch ceremonies, which 
more through cuftbm than neceflity, are ufed by- 
way of punHhment in fchools, but which under 
fome inftitutions form the routine of life, I need

been in faftrion in our country for fome ages :— *

happen to go by the monaftery of La Trappe, or 
any other where they are in eartieft about fuch bu«

ance it might be made to receive from the infpec*

much regularity as* could be delired ; nor would 
the pride of Tobofo have been fo long a difench ant-

Neither do I mean to give any inftru&ions to^thc

got at Sboomlo, only for taking a peep at the town 
ftom a thing they call a minsrtt (tike our monu- 
ment) in purfuance of invitation, has cancelled any 
claims they might have had upon me for the dinner 
they gave me at the Divan, had it been better than 
it was. 

If die idea of fome of thefe applications fhould 
have brought a fmile upon your countenance, it 
won't hurt you, my dear **** nor mould it hurt 
the principle. Your candour will prevent you 
from condemning a great and new invented in- 
ftmraent of government, becaufe fome of the pur- 
pofes to which it is poffibfe to apply it may appear 
ufelefs, or trifling, or mifchievous, or ridiculous. 
Its great excellence confute, in the great ftrength 
it is capable of giving to any inflitution it may be 
thought proper to apply it to. If any perverfe ap- 
plications fhould ever be made of it, they will lie 
in this cafe as in others, at the doors of thofe who 
make them. Knives however fharp, are very 
ufeful things, and, for mod purpofes, the fharper 
the more ufeful. I have no fear therefore of 
your wifhing to forbid the ule of them, becaufe

I hope no critic of more learning than candour 
will do an Infpe&ion-houfc fo much injuftice as to 
compare it to Dionyjlush ear. The obje& of that 
contrivance was, to know what prifoners faid with- 
out their fufpe&ing any fuch thing. The obje& 
of the infpe£tion principle is dire&ly the reverfe ; 
it is to make them not only fufpetl, but be ajfured t 
thfat whatever they do is known, even though that 
fliould not be the cafe. Dete&ion is the obje& of 
the £rft : prevention, that of the latter. In the 
former cafe the ruling perfon is a fpy ; in the latter 
he is a monitor. The obje& of the firft was to 
pry into the fecret recedes of the heart ; the latter, 
confining its attention to qvert a&s, leaves 
thoughts and fancies to their proper ordinary, the 
court above. 

When I confider the extenfive variety of ptnr- 
pofes to which this principle may be applied, and 
the certain efficacy which, as far as I can truft my 
own conceptions, it promifes to them all, my won- 
der is, not only this plan fhould never have hither- 
to been put in practice, but how any othqr fhould 
ever have been thought of.

dlemoft Infpe&ion-Gallery, in which is inclofed 
theJowermoft Chapel-Gallery, and within that 
again the Area of the Chapel ; *on a third, the up- 
pcrmoft Chapel-Gallery. 

The Cellular mafs, together with the Infpedtion- 
Tower inclofed within it, compofe the charadter-

forms an accidental and ineflential appendage. 

The whole of the chara&eriftic part may be 
conceived as compofed of two Towers, one within 
the other, with the Annular WeH between diem, f 

A particularity that will require to be conftantly 
kept in mind is, that in the two polygono-cylin- 
drical maffes, the circumfcribing and the inferibed, 
not only the numbers of the ftories do not agree,, 
the latter having but half the number of the for- 
mer, but that no one ftory in the interior part coin- 
cides in point of level with any one ftory of the ex- 

* The Area of the Chapel cannot perhaps in ftri&nefs be faid 
to form part of the fame ftory with the lowermoft Chapel-gallery* 
The floor being fcvrral foot below the level of that of the Gal- 
lery, may be looked upon as forming in that part a flory by 
itfclf. But this want of,exa&. coincidence is no more than what 
occurs frequently in common houfes.

HOW to give to the Infpe&ors accefs to the 
prifoners in their Cells? In the firft defign, 
•ftories of Intermediate Area, ferving as paffages,were 
allotted to-this purpofe : in number, agreeing with 
.the Stories of Infpe&ion Lodge: in point of level, 
coinciding, as was neceffaiy, with the loweft ftory 
.. of each pair of Gells. Apertures, cut here and 
there through the uppermoft of thefe ftories of 
.patfeges, were to give light and air to thofe below. 

For what purpofe thefe paflages ? For coramuni- 
-cation, and no other.— But the more I confidered 
.the more plainly I perceived, that, for uninterrupted 
communication there would be no ufe. The firft 
fuccedaneum that prefented itfelf was a multitude 
of fiying Staircafes of Qpen iron-work: at laft I

Space took the place of matter, from the bottom of 
the building to the top : and thus a Well was formed 
all the way up, crowned -by an uninterrupted Sky- 
Jlght as broad, and opening in as many places, as 
-poflible. 

Airinefs, lightfomenefs, economy, and increafed 
fecurity, are the evident refults of this fimple alte- 
ration: above all things, airinefs, the want of which 
it might not by any other means, have been very 
><eafy to remove. This vacuity does fervice in a

3. No Prifoner can ever make any attempt up- 
on the grating that forms the interior boundary of 
his Cell, without being vifible to every one of the 
three ftations in the Infpe£tion-part. 

4. During meal-times and at church-times, 
by ftationing the Prifoners clofe to the grating, 
two out of three Infpe&ors may befpared. 

5. The Cell-Galleries are, every one of them, 
perfe&ly commanded by every ftation in the In- 
fpe&ion-part. 

6. An attempt can fcarcely if at all be made on 
a window in the third ftory of Cells, without being 
vifible, not only to its proper ftory, (viz* the 2d) of 
the Infpe&ion-part, but likewife to the firft, nor 
upon a window in the 4th ftory of Cells, without

aflbciations, under the common plan and undet 
the all prefemtive influence of the infpe&ion 
principle. 

A fourth is, between the duration the folitarj 
difcipline is capable of requiring in a Penitentiary 
Houfe, and that which it may poffibly be of ufe to> 
give to it in aHoufeof Corre&ion. It maybe longer 
in the latter.* Why ? Becaufe in a Penitentiary 
Houfe all it can be wanted for is to produce iflttne* 
diate fubmiffion : for, as to reformation andchangd 
of character, years are remaining for that talk : 
the offender is not returned from 1 thence into un* 
Fimited fociety. In a Houfe of Corre&ion, the 
term being fo much fhorter, the remedy muft be 
fo much the more powerful. If the reformation 
of the offender is not compleated in his folitary

and good order, four is not fuch a number as can 
well be deemed unmanageable: if it were, how 
would fo many more be managed all day long in the 
work-mops, and that without the benefit of invifi- 
ble infpe£tion, as on the common plans? As to room, 
four would have much more of it in one of thefe 
Double Cells, than two would have in a Single Cell 
formed by the divifion of fuch a Double Cell into 
equal parts. A partition in certain cafes excludes 
from ufe a much greater fpace than that which it 
covers.* 

Under this arrangement, folitude in its charac- 
ter of a temporary inftrument is by no means laid 
afide. On die contrary it is made applicable, to i 
greater, indeed to an almoft unlimited extent, and 
what is more, without any additional expence. 
Two I call, as before, the ordinary complement for 
thefe Double Cells. Conceive the whole number 
of the Cells provided with their ordinary comple-

Chapel Introduced.* 

THE neceffity of a Chapel to a Penitentiary 
Houfe is a point rather to be affumed than 
argued. Under an eftablifhed Church of any per- 
fuafion, a fyftem of penitence without the means 
of regular devotion would be a downright folecifm. 
If religious inftru&ion and exercife be not necef- 
fary to the worft and generally the mod ignorant 
of tinners, to whom elfe can they be other than 
iuperfluous? 

This inftru&ion, where then fliall they be placed 
to receive it? No where better than where they are. 
There they are in a ftateof continued fafe-cuftody : 
and there they are without any additional expence. 
It remains only to place the Chaplain : and where 

• The Chapel, not being a chara&eriftic part of the defign, will 
he fufficiently underftood from the Draught, without any particu- 
lar explanation. For the whole detail of this part, I am in- 
debted to my profcffional advifer, Mr. Revely, of Great Titch- 
field ftreet, Marybone, whofe beautiful and correct drawings of 
Views in the Levant have been fo much admixed by the dilettante 
in Grecian and Egyptian antiquities.

^nce of every rule that can contribute to keep the 
eftablifhment in a ftate of exemplary neatnefs and 
cleanlinefs, while the profit of them will pay him

this the henefit of the example, and of the com* 
ments that would be made on it by learned and 
religious lips : Thefe feeds of virtue inftead of be- 
ing buried in obfcurity, as in other improved pri- 
fons, would thus be diffeminated far and wide. 

Whatever profit, if any, the contractor could 
make out of this part of the plan, why grudge it 
him ? Why to his eftabliftiment more than to any of 
thofe juft mentioned? Not a penny of it but would 
be a bounty upon good management and a fecurity

If the furniture and decoration of the ChapeF 
would require fome expence, though very little 
decoration would be requifite, a faving on the 
other hand refults from the degree of opennefe 
which fuch a deftination fuggefted and rendered 
neceffary. On the original plan, the whole cir- 
cuit of the central part, then appropriated folely to 
infpedtion, was to have been filled with glafe: on 
the prefent plan, which lays this part open in dif- 
ferent places to the amount of at leaft half its

Two defiderata had been aimed at in the con-

that as well while moving to and fro as while fitting 
or (tending (UU : ft. The capacity of receiving in the 
fame place vifitors who fhould be in the fame pre- 
dicament. 

The fecond of thefe obje&s is not to be difpenfed 
with. If the Governor or Sub-Governor cannot

people: at leaft upon the face of this {ingle fuppo- 
lition : though to one whofe conception fllould 
have embraced the whole fyftem of fafeguard and

formidable enough to warrant the incurring any 
expence or facrificing any advantage. 

Upon the firft crude conception, as ftated hi

from the Cells: if there is not light enough there 
for him to be feen from the Cells, there will not be 
light enough to enable him to do his bufihefs. 

The difficulty would not be removed, even tho* 
the Chapel part in the center were thrown out, 
and the Infpe&or's apartment extended fo as to 
fwallow up that central part, and occupy the 
whole circle. My expedient of diametrical fcreens, 
or partitions croffing each other at right angles, 
Would not anfwer the purpofe :* if they extended 
all the way from the circumference to the center,' 
leaving no vacuity at that part, they would divide 
the whole circle into feparate quadrants : a man

the Cells correfponding to the others. Stationed ex-

but little if any advantage over an annular Gal- 
lery at the extremity of the circle, as contrived by 
Mr* Revely. The circuit might be performed 
nearer the center^ but ftill to carry on the proceis 
of infpefrion a circuit muft be performed. Nor 
could it be performed in an exadr, circle : the fmal- 
ler circle thus meant to be performed, would be 
broken in upon and lengthened in four places by 
zigzags, which would retard a man's progrefs more 
than an equal length of circle, and might upon thfc 
whole confume a portion of time little lefs than 
what would be requifite for performing the peram* 
bulation in Mr. Revely's Infpe&ion-Galleries,* 

* The truth is, what one would hardly have fuppofed, that for 
performing this perambulation, a walk of about 46 foot and back 
again in a ftraight line is pretry well fufficient. Station the In* 
fpe&or any where with his eye contiguous to the outer circum- 
ference of his ring, he can, without quitting the (pot he ftan<Js 
or fits on, command a view of feven Cells on each fide. In tfye 
fame ring 46 foot may be defcribed in walking without deviating 
from the right line : and 46 foot is the length of the chord tub- 
tending the (pace occupied in the circumference by 5 Cells* A 
walk then, in a line equal and oppofite to the chord fubtending 
the part of the Gallery that correfponds to the Dead Fart, will 
give an Infpe&or in his Gallery a view of the whole circuit. If, as

By being painted black in the infide that ftation

§ 8* Irifpe8ioh~Galkrics and Lodge. 6f 

One expedient there remains by which, if it be 
worth while, the- iavifibility* of the Iftfpe&or may 
be preferved to htm, withoutthe obligation, of ever 
ftirring from his feat- This however is fubje<9? to 
two reftriftions : one is, that whenever he quits ** 
particular fpot in the room topafs to any other 
part of the feme room he muft become vifible : 
the othei? is. that his invifibility is not fhared by 
any other perfen in the room. The expedient 
is to plage die Infpe<5tor in x kind of lantern, 
jfhaped fomewhat like two fhort necked funnels 
joined together at their necks. 

Placed as before on a floor fituated midway be- 
tween the floor and the ceiling of the lowermoft of 
tlje two ftories he commands, his light comes to 
hjm from a fpot elevated above the eye of a perfor* 
Handing in the uppermoft of thofe ftories : confe- 
quently in all cafes above the eye of any perfon 
dwelling in that upper ftory. Level with his eye 
whether fitting or ftanding, the lantern narrows td 
fqcb a degree as to enable him to carry his eye,, 
clofe to the circumference all round, without 
changing the fpot he fits or ftands on. 

from this, alt of you, that In this bouft tranfgrtjfion never tan be 

fafi. V* ill the policy bt cruel ? No ; it will be kind ; it will" 

prevent traufgreffing : it will fave punifliing.

To give him his view, the lantern is pierced at 
both elevatious with (mall holes, correfpondmg, a$ 
upon trial fhall be found moft convenient, each of 
them to one or two or fome greater number of the 
Cells. Thefe wholes are no larger than the aper- 
ture of a common fpying glafs, and like that clofed 
by a piece of glafs, which if neceffary might be co- 
loured, or fmoked, or darkened by a blind. Grant 
that after all they will not perfectly exclude the 
thorough light, nor prevent his figure from being 
to a certain degree vifible from the Cells. Still 
however the part of his figure thus betrayed will 
be fo fmall, that to the purpofe of difcovering to a 
prifoner in his Cell whether the eye of the Infpec- 
tor is at that moment directed towards him or us, 
it will be fame thing as if he were invifible. That, 
by diminifhing the apertures to a certain degree, 
the effect might becompaffed, is indubitable : for 
the lantern might be of the thinnefs of paper; in 
fhort it might in that part be of paper and then a 
pin-hole would be fufficient to give him a view. 
Any opake objedt to let down by a line and pully 
on his going out would prevent his abfence from 
being difcernible. The difference between a body

nefs of the apertures. 

At the altitude reachiag between the Height of 
his eye when fitting, and the height of his eye 
when (landing, the lantern could not be too nar- 
row : it fhould be only juft Miride enough to ad^ 
mitt his head and fhoulders with eafe. Above and 
below that height the wider the better, for the 
fake of air and room, fo as it did not fwell out in . 
iiich manner as to intercept his view. 

The next queftion is, how to prevent the pri- 
foners from feeing when it is he quits his ftation? 
His exit and return if performed by a door in die 
fide, would be vifible from all or almoft all the 
Cells : his lantern not ferving him in the capacity 
of a fcreen on fuch occafions to any degree worth 
mentioning. To prevent fuch difcovery, his en- 
trance muft be, not at an ordinary door on the fide, 
but at a trap-door by a ladder from below. Th<f 
lantern might however befides that be furnifliei 
with a door at the fide, to give him paflage at times 
when the concealment of his fituation was no longer 
material, and when he faw occafion to (hew him-

f age to or from his Cell for the purpofe and in the 
manner already mentioned. 

The central aperture, large as it is would be 
no bar to the employing of this contrivance. 
The lantern, it is true could not occupy this 
central part: it muft be placed ibme where on 
one fide of it, in fome part of fome farrounding 
ring. The Infpe&or therefore, while Rationed in 
this lantern, would not have a view equally near 
of all his Cells : but of all he would have fome view, 
jand that, one may venture to fay, a fufficient one ; 
the difference would only be the diftance from 
the center of the lantern to the center of the 
building: fay from ten to a dozen foot. The 
part too from which he was in this manner fartheft 
Removed might be the Dead part where there are 
.no Cells: a divifion which upon the prefent plan, 
occupies £ve forts in twenty *fcur of the whole 
-circuit. 

Still however an apartment thus*circumftanced 
would not ferve perfectly well for vifitors: for 
they at any .rate would bevifible to the prifoners,: 
which for the reaibns already mentioned, it were 
better they (hould not be. Here then comes in

been defcribed: ufes, to which, it will be equally 
manifeft that a tranfparent room, fitted up with 
an infpe&on lantern, would not be applicable with 
advantage. 

The Infpe&or's Lodge is a circular or rather 
annular apartment immediately underneath the 
Chapel. The diameter I propofe now to give it 
is 54 foot including the aperture in the center.* 

The central aperture in this ftory is of the fame 
diameter as in the area of the Chapel, and the

fo does the correspondent aperture in the area of 
the Chapel give light to die Lodge. 

Of thefe central apertures that which is in the 
floor of the Chapel takes nothing of thsroora from 
vifitors. During Chapel times it is clofed : the 
ftate of darknefs to which it thereby reduces the 
Lodge is then of noconfequence, fince at thofe times 
nobody is there. So likewife in a cold winter's

the faculty of clofing this aperture will probahly be

Lodge an occafional view of the Cells. Ofthefe 
the two lower ftories may be feen through the 
lowermoft Infpedtion-Gallery : the others without 
any intermedium. 

The ways in which this view might be opened 
are more than one ; the fimpleft is to put two rows 
of panes : one for giving a view of the two lowermoft 
ftories of Cells, a little below the higheft part of 
the uprightpartition : the other for the four remain- 
ing ftories, in the chord fubtending the angle made 
by the jup&ion of that partition with die deling. 
Tp thefe may be adapted blinds of coarfe white 
muflin or linnen, pierced every inch or two with

fpangle. By this means matters may unqueftion- 
ably be ordered in fome way or other, fo that no

tin& view of the correfponding Cells.

To gain the height at which the bufinefs of in- 
fpe&ion can in this manner be occafionally per- 
formed from the Lodge, an afcent of about I or §

circular bench of about 2 foot wide, attached all 
round to the Partition-wall. It may be diftin-

fupply the place of thofe order- tablets, and if at all, with very 
confiderable advantage. The intercourse by the tablets is limited 
to the few orders they can be made to hold : it is not reciprocal s 
the apparatus, from what I recollect of Mr* Merlin's price, would

For fuch purpofes the tube alone without a bell would anfwer

much wafte of time in families, for a fervant to be obliged to go 
up three or four pair of ftairs to receive orders which are to be exe- 
cuted in the kitchen from whence he came.

clofe and parallel to the converfation-tubes, imme-

It is at the level of the ceiling that thefe air-tubes' 
fhould difcharge themfelves into the Lodge, and 
not at the level of the floor. In the latter cafe they 
could not anfwer this intention without a continual 
blaft, which in cold weather would be very trou- 
blesome. In the other way the blaft beginning above 
die level of the head, is diredted upwards and gives 
no annoyance. Health is not bought at the ex- 
pence of comfort. 

In giving the flope to the ceiling in manner 
above-mentioned, I had two conveniences in view : 
ventilation and ftowage. To ventilation, which 
is the principal objeft, a re&ilinear flope in this 
cafe is more favourable not only than a horizontal 
ceiling, but even than a coved ceiling or dome.

§ 9* OF THE

UNDER the general name of Communications 
may be comprifed, 
i. The Paflages, and Galleries ferving only as 
paflages. 

2. Staircafes. 

3. Gates, Doors, and apertures anfwering the

None of thefe but are articles of very material 
concern in a prifon. 

In a Panopticon prifon one general problem ap- 
plies to all : to extend to all of them, without ex- 
ception or relaxation, the influence of the command- 
ing principle. Cells, Communications, Outlets* 
Approaches, there ought not any where be a fmgle

to be a lurkingplacc for the moft reprobate of the 
prifoners, and the fcene of all forts of forbidden 
pra&ices. 

In an ordinary public building there is an t»fe 
in having the Communications fpacious and nume- 
rous. In a prifon they ought rather to be few and 
narrow. Convenience is the great objeft in the 
one cafe, fecurity in the other. The fewer the 
eafier guarded : the narrower, the lefs force there 
can be at any given point to oppofe to the com- 
manding and defeniive force of the prifon. Nor 
will the facrifice requifite to be made of conveni- 
ence be found fo great as might be imagined. la 
an ordinary public building, perfons have occalion 
to pafs in indeterminate numbers at a time, and the 
fame perfon frequently. In a well-contrived and 
well-regulated prifon, at leaft in a prifon upon this 
conftrudtion, the perfons who are to pafik and the 
times at which they have occafton to pafs are all 
foreknown and regiftered. — Sacrifice did I fay? 
The reader has already feen mujfr convenience 
gained, and I hope he will fee fcarce any focrificed. 
. The objects that required to be attended to in 
planning a fyftem of Communications for an efta* 
blifhment of this kind were, 1. The ends to be kept 
in view in the contrivance, 2. The places to and

from which Communications were to be contrived r 
the perfonsand things for which the Communica-

The ends to be kept in view with regard to the 
prifoners are principally four. 

1. Uninterrupted cxpofure to invifible infpec- 
tion. 

2. Inability to attack the keeper or do other 
mifchief. 

3. Separation of the fexes, if both are included 
in one building. 

4. Prevention ofconverfewith prifoners of other 
Cells* at times of paffing to and fro. 

The places in queftion are, 1. The Cells. 
1. The Infpe6tion Galleries. 3. The Infpe&orV

6. The Fire-places. 7. The Yards. 

The per Jons in queftion are, 1 . The Prifoners. 
a. The Keepers: 3. Vifitors to the Head-keeper 
and other officers, on bufinefs or curiofity? 4* 
Vifitors to the Chapel. 

The things in queftion may be reduced to the

kind they might be without inconvenience.* 

2. I make no more than two. In a building for 
ordinary ufes this number might befcanty: it is 
not fo in fuch an one as the prefent. The occa- 
fions on which they will be wanted are few : they 
may be all known and n umbered. f

part of a Cell, and from the neareft no more than eleven, nothing 
but the occafion of taking a minute examination of fome fmall 
object can fummon them thither. Once a day at moft will be 
amply fufficient. The prifoners they let in and out of their Cells, 
without quitting their own ftation, in manner hereafter described* 
They have befides for their feparate ufe, if neceflary, the Lodge- 
Stair-cafe for their loweft floor, and the company's Stair-cafes ft>r 
the two floors above it. 

for Talk- matters as fuch, the occafion to ufe thefe Staircafet 
is but little more frequent. Their bufinefs lies in the Cells t 
all day long, unlefs it be at mealtime, they will be in one or other 
of the Cells. Raw materials may be distributed, and finifhed work 
collected, at ftated periods, in the fame manner as the provifions. 
This operation may be directed by the Infpe&ors without ftirring

5. I place them within the interior boundary or

the line of the Cell -Galleries. This I do, that 
the width of the Cell-Galleries in that part may 
afford fuflicient landing-place, as well for a prifoner 
when he has opened the door leading to the ftair- 
cafe from the Cell Gallery, as to an Infpe&or in

circle on that fide : Whereas on a fuperior ftoiy 
die chance would not extend to fuch of the pri- 
foners whofe Cells were fituated in any inferior 
one. 

7. The Stair-cafes are of iron bars and not of 
brick or ftone. — — 1. That they may be the more 
airy. 2. That one part may intercept the light 
from another as little as poflible. — 3. That the 
prifoners as they go up and down may be expofed 
as much as poflible to view from the Infpe&ion- 
Galleries in that quarter. 

8. It is alfo for the latter reafon that the 8ights 
of fteps run parallel to the Infpediion-Galleries. 
Had their courfe been at right angles to thofe Gal- 
leries, the Stairs being interpofed between the pri- 
foners in their afcent or defcent and the Infpec- 
tor'seye, would have fcreened them from his view. 

9. The ufe of the Pully-doors, which on open-

proach of a prifoner, upon an occafion mentioned

fummoned to let him into his Cell, and in the 
mean time to have an eye upon his motions.

place, behind which runs the Staircafe upon the

partly by the mode of opening, the view is pretty 
effe&ually cutoff, as between the prifoners on the 
Staircafe and thofe within the Cells.* 

1 1. In making the Staircafes at all wider than 
the Galleries there would be no ufe. 1. There 
can never be any occafion for conveying by the 
former any thing that cannot pafs along the latter. 

2. There is not even fo much occafion for width 
in the ftaircafe as in the Galleries, fince any 
thing that could not be conveyed by the ftaircafes 
might be hoiftedup into the Galleries by the crane. 

3. Any thing that required greater width might 
be conveyed, either by the Lodge Staircafe cr 

, thro* the Central Aperture, to the Infpe&ion Gal- 
lery on that floor, and to the two higher floors by

AS to the Keepers, Infpe&ors, or Talk-mafters t

the feveral piles of Cells with their Staircafes and 
the remainder of the Dead part. Parallel to 
this, and between this and the pile of Staircafe, 
doors, at the diftance of about 4 foot, I place a thin 
partition all the way up, with blinded fpying-holes 
running in the line level with the Infpe&or's eye.. 
Between the two run two narrow flights df fteps, 
no more than about two foot wide each ; by that 
which is neareft the thick partition, the Infpe&or 
defcends to that part of the Prifoqers* Staircafe 
which is upon a level with the inferior one of his 
two (lories of Ceils ; by the other, he afcends to 
that which is upon a level with the fuperior one: or

the landing-place is croffed by a grated door of 
equal width, made in the grating which on that 
fide forms a boundary to the landing-place from 
top to bottom, and opening upon the land ing-place« 
This door, which is kept conftantly locked, the key 
being in the cuftody of the InfpecT»r, ferves when 
ihuttokeep the Prifoners from draggling out of 
their Staircafe over the Infpe&orV Staircafes; to

all who fee him he is prefent; nor is he abfent

viz, on his Staircafe, it does not follow but that 
he may be prefent at fomc other part of his ftation, 
from whence he may be viewing him while he is

dary of the Staircafe, from whence the thicker oS

give room for currents of .air to pals in a horizontal 
direction as well as in the perpendicular one. 

Thofe which might be acceflible to the prifoners r 
viz. thofe made in the partition- wall of the pri- 
foners' Staircafe, are in dimensions not big enough, 
to give paflage to the body erf a man or boy : fitua- 
ted out of the reach of the prifoners, they are clo- 
fed by opening or Aiding windows or fhutters, ca-

the governing principle, and convenience on this 
head will depend in good meafure on local circum- 
ftancts, filch as the form and dimenfions of the

will abut,, and the form and dimenfions of the Offi- 
cers apartments on that fide, in or near the Pro- 
jefting front. 

( The form which in a general view appears mofl 
advantageous, is that of a ftraight and fimple flight 
of fteps without return or curvature. The conve- 
nience of a return is, that half the room is faved : 
fhe inconvenience of it is, that the fpace, a man has 
to traverfe in order to reach a given point, is aug- 
mented, to the amount of what would be die whole 
length of the Staircafe, if laid out in aright line. 
The point however at which it terminates and

through ignorance or defign, accefs fhould be gained

Regularity would require, but convenience does 
hardly, that on the right hand of the paffage there 
Ihould be a fimilar ftaircafe.* * 

At the line where it falls into the anterior part of 
the Central Area, the Diametrical Paffage iscrofled 
by a pair of folding-gates of open iron-work oc- 
cupying its whole width. Thefe gates prevent 
promifcuous vifitors from advancing any farther, 
and draggling either into the Warehoufe on each 
fide, or the pofterior part of the Intermediate Area, 

Before it reaches this tranfverfe gate it receives 
no fide doors on either fide. Such doors, if opening 
into the anterior part of the Intermediate Area, 
would require porters to guard them: if into the 
Warehoufe, viz. the fpace between the Intermedi- 
ate and Central Area, they would render it left 
fafe to make ufe of the labour of the prifonw in 
that part of the building.

of cuftomers and other visitors. It is therefore on the other tide 
that the room for the Staircafe can beftbe fpared.

EXIT INTO THE TARDS. 

THE Exit into the Yards is one of the niceft 
parts of the anatomy of the prifon. 

The Diametrical Paflage when arrived at the an- 
terior circumference of the farther fide of the An- 
nular Area, is abforbed by it : but recommencing 
at the pofterior circumference, is there cut into 
three branches : a middle one, being a line of om- 
munication joining without difcontinuance the la- 
fpedtion-Gallery over-head to the Watch-houje^ or 
Look-out* that ferves for the infpe&ion of the Yards : 
and two lateral *ones, one on the male, and the 
other on the female fide. Taking their common, 
departure from the grating of the Annular Grated 
Paflage, they run on. in parallelifm, like a nerve, an 
artery and a vein. 

The nerve which conveys to the moft diftant 
extremity of this artificial body the all-vivifying in- 
fluence of the infpe&ion principle — the line of

that is, fo long as it hangs over the Intermediate 
Area, and till it reaches the region of the Cell-Gal- 
lery. While it does fo, I call it the Infpeflor'i

on the outfide of the building, the Infpeclor\ Inner. 
Bridge. At that line, in order to fall within the,

A few inches below the level of the cieling of

maker, what taylor, what coach-maker, can work 
with drenched or frozen hands? 

To mitigate the cold, and to exclude fnow and 
rain, Mr. Howard allows a wooden fhutter. But 
to do this fuch a fhuttermuft exclude light. What 
is the wretched folitary to do then ? creep into hi* 
bed, or fit down and pine in forced and ufelefs in- 
dolence. 

Mr. Howard with all this allows no firing. One 
would think from him there were no winter. 

The thicker walls are, and the higher above 
the floor, holes in the wall inftead of Windows 
are, the better they ferve to keep out cold and 
rain : hence another reafon for piling bricks upon 
bricks, and giving rooms in prifons the height 
of thofe in palaces. 

In rooms that have no light that is not three or 
four feet above the eye, weaving can fcarcely be 
carried on : from fuch rooms that profitable em- 
ployment, that quiet employment, in other re- 
fpe&sfo well fuited to an eftabliftiment of this kind, 
is therefore in all its infinity of branches peremp-

At Wymondham thefe holes are guarded each

(though how he is even by night to elude the eye of

a wall of 13 foot high to climb, as we fhall fee, 
ere he can reach the Yards. And were he over 
this wall where would he be then? In a fpace 
inclofed by another high wall, with three centinels

If fattened up in two places on each fide,

may want about 7 inches of reaching the brick-work 
at bottom, and about ten inches of reaching that at 
top : efpecially if they terminate at top and bottom, 
not in an horizontal bar, but in a row of perpendi- 
cular fpikes : by this means little more than 3I foot 
in height of grating will ferve for a Window 5 fed

Among the offenders who are liable to be con- 
signed to thefe fcenes of punifhment, it is but too 
common to fee boys of little more than ten years 
-of age. A thin perfon, boy or man, can generally 
get his body through, wherever he can pafs his 
head : that is, if not hindered by the breadth of his 
body, he will not be by the thicknefs. But a per- 
fon cannot prefs againft the point of a fpike as he 
could againft a bar. From thefe data gratings 
might be formed requiring a much lefs quantity of

THE peculiarities of the prefent plan are not 
confined to the head of conftru£tion : they 
extend in fome degree to the materials. The 
abundant ufe made of iron will hardly fail to be 
obferved. 

In preferring brick or ftone-work to wood, and 
inconfequence arches to other partitions, it does no 
more than follow the plans already in vogue. Such 
a mode of conftru&ion is more particularly necef- 
lary in a Panopticon than in a building of perhaps 
any other form. The circumftance that renders it 
fo peculiarly favourable to ventilation, renders itcf 
courfe equally expofed, if made of combuftible ma- 
terials, to accidents from fire. Were a fire to 
begin anywhere, efpecially towards the center, it 
would fpread all round, the wind would pour in

ablaze: and the prifoners, being locked up in their 
Cells, and even were there Cells open, deprived of 
all exit except through one or two narrow paffages, 
would be burnt or fuffocated before any affiftance 
could be applied. 

This at ieaft would be the cafe were it not for 
the care taken to keep accumulated a large fund of 
water in the ciftern at the top of the building, ready 
to be poured in whenever and wherever there may 
be occalion for it. But notwithftanding this affift- 
ance, and the great fecurity againft all fuch acci- 
dents afforded by the circumftance of unremitted 
infpeftion, as a building of this fort is defigned for 
duration, and the difference in point of expence 
need not be confiderable, it feemsbeft to be on the 
fafe fide.*

to different advantages. Sometimes t6 admltt air, 
fometimes to (ave room, fometimes for die fake of 
ftrength. In all inftances it has the advantage of 
being peculiarly impregnable to putrid contagion : 
even plaifter, brick and ftone not being in this re- 
fpe£t altogether above reproach. Hence the great 
ftrefs laid on frequent white-wafhing, wherever 
any of the three latter materials are employed. 

It is partly on account of the admiffion it gives 
to air that I prefer it for both the Prifoners' Stair- 
cafes, and for all their Galleries. In arched Gal- 
leries of brick or ftone, befides that they would 
take up room, the air might be apt to ftagnate. 
Subftituting open-work to fuch dole materials 
adds in effeft fo much in width to the Annular- 
Well. The interftices between the bars inftead of 
forming an obftiufiion to a current of air, ferve 
rather to accelerate it. 

It was the confideration of the little room taken 
up by this material that fuggefted it to me as pe- 
culiarly well adapted to the purpofe of affording 
fupports to the Chapel. Brick pillars, of the thick- 
nefs neceflary to fupport fo lofty a building, would 
afford a very material obftru£bion to the voice in its 
paffage from the Minifter to the Prifoners, when 
ftationed in their Cells, or in the Galleries before

wife that I propofe to make confiderable ufe of it 
in theconftru&ion of the Infpe£ti©n-Galleries. It id 
to obtain both thefe advantages that I make ufe of no 
other material for one entire boundary (viz. the in- 
terior one oppofite the windows) of every Cell. 

To obtain that fort of ftrength which confifts in 
inflexibility, with lefs unweildinefs and at a lefe 
expence of materials, it occurred to me to make the 
pillars hollow. Being of iron, they may thus be 
made not only to take up beyond comparifon lefs 
room,but even to poffefs greater ftrength, even when 
hollowed to fuch a degree as not to exceed brick 
or ftone in weight. It occurred to me that iron wat 
caft in large mafles to ferve for water-pipes. Upon 
enquiry at a great foundery where it is caft for fuch 
purpofes, I learnt that in that manufactory it 
could be caft hollow for a length of 12 foot, but no' 
more. Upon confulting with my profeffional ad- 
vifer, I was informed that that length could be mad© 
to fuflice : and it occurred to him that of the eight 
fupports which would be a fufficient number for 
fuch a building, fome might be made to anfwer the 
purpofe of water-pipes for conveying the water 
from the roof: and to me that others of them might 
be made to ferve for chimneys? articles for which,

it might othcrwife be not altogether eafy in a 
building of fo peculiar a conftru&ion to find a

In point of economy I hope to find this ufeful 
material not more expenfive, but rather lefs fo than 
the quantity erf (lone or brick-work that would be 
Tequifite to anfwer the fame purpofe.* Since caft- 
iron, and in moft inftances, even that not of the 
fineft quality f would anfwer as well as hammered 
-with half the expence. 

It is at the recommendation of the fame intelli- 
gent artift that I adopt thofe called ftucco or plaif- 
tcrfloors % in preference to any other : and this for 
•a variety of reafons. 

i. They arc incombuftible. In this refpe& 
they have the advantage of wooden floors. 

2 They take up very little room. The thick- 
nefs of ii inch over the brick-work at the crown 
is fufficient In this point they have the advan- 
tage over all other floors, and moft of all over

them on. 

3. They are uniform without crevices or inter*

tage over all other floors : in the higheft degree 
over brick, then over wood, and even over ftone. 
The inconvenience of crevices and interftices, as 
well remarked by Mr. Howard, is to harbour dirt, 
and occafionally putrefcent matter, capable of 
fouling the air, and affording ill fcents. 

4. They are cheap. When thus thinly laid, 
much cheaper than wood, or ftone, or even than 
any choice kind of brick, fuch as clinkers : and 
full as cheap as any tiling that would be proper for 
the purpofe, 

5. They are, it is true, liable to crack : efpe^ 
daily on the firft fettling of the building. On the 
other hand, if a crack takes place, they are eafily 
and cffe&ually repaired* 

Mr. Howard lays great ftrefs on the unwhole- 
fomenefs of fuch flqprs, as by their roughnefs, fuch 
as unplained boards, or by numerous and wide in* 
interftices, are apt to harbour putrefcent matter : 
but I know not that he any where recommends

floors from that inconvenience. t

When the Prifoners have got the length of the 
Lanes, or of the yards on each fide, that is at the 
lead near 13 foot di fiance from the building, the 
interception of converfe muft, as it fafely may, be 
trufted to the expedients employed for preventing 
thofe in the Cells from looking out of their win- 
dows. 

When the Prifoners are a few feet advanced be- 
yond the External Area, they come to a Door ', 
which lets out upon the open ground fuch of them 
as belong to the two yards immediately contiguous 
on each fide : fince it would be ufelefs to carry them 
on to the Look-out, only to return them from 
thence into thofe yards. If there are no more di- 
vifions, no more yards, than thefe two, here the 
Prifoners' Lanes terminate : if there are other yards, 
the lanes lead on till they terminate in the common 
Central Yard encompafling the Look-out. The 
Infpe&or at any rate has his door correfponding in

Made long rather than circular, they would be

his work would anfwer every purpofe. It is oa 
Sundays, and on Sundays alone that the Prifoners in 
general would be at certain hours in the yards : and 
during thofe periods he might give his whole time

be confined to their refpe&ive divifions. This 
jundion and reparation would of courfe be necef- 
fery, if a bath for females were placed 'near the 
Walking-wheel on that fide. 

As to the degree of fpacioufnefs to be given to 
die Yards — in a general fketch which has no indi- 
vidual objeft in view, to fpecify demenfions will be 
fcen to be impoflible : principles with illuftrations 
are the utmoft that can be expe&ed. 

The obje£fe to be attended to are, on the one 
fide, room and ventilation : on the other facility of 
hnfpeftion y and cheapnefs. 

To eftimate what may be neceffary for room, it 
would be neceffary firft to fettle the operations that 
are to be carried on in the Yards, and the articles 
that are to be placed in them : Such are 

1. Airing-wheels: enough for fupplying water 
to the building. See fe&ion on Airing. 

2. Additional number of Airing-wheels : in the 
whole, a wheel (fay) to every 18 perfons, or a pro- 
portionable number of double, treble, or quadruple 
wheels. I call the wheel a fingle, double, treble 
one, &c. with reference to the number of perfons 
that are to be fet to walk in it at once. 

%. Machines

§ 20. Ounets. 1$$ 

' 3. Machines to be kept in motion by fuch fu* 
pernumerary Airing-wheels. 

4. Bathing-bafons, one or two according to the 
fexes. 

5. Open fchools, for Sunday's fchooling. See 
the fedtion on Schooling. 

6. Walking or marching-parade for Sunday's 
exercife. 

As to ventilation, though a diflant obje£t, it is 
one that will hardly require a diftinft provifion. 
A fpace that affords room enough for the walking- 
parade can fcarcely be deficient in point of airi- 
nefs. 

In ventilation much depends upon the form 01 
the ground. A declivity is in this point of view 
preferable by far to a dead flat. Place the building 
upon a rifing ground, the wall though a high one 
may be but little or not at all higher than 
the furface of the ground is for fome diftance 
round the building. So far as this is the cafe, fo 
far the walls afford no obftru&ion at all to the cur- 
rent of air. 

But even in a dead flat, there feems little necef- 
flty for bellowing any expence, in giving on this 
fcore any addition to the quantity of fpace abfo- 
Jutely neceflary for the marching exercife above

alluded to. Noxious trades out of the queftion, 
the only imaginable fources of contamination to 
irhich the airisexpofedare putridity and refpiration, 
Againfl the former, fufficient fecurity may be af- 
$wded by the discipline of theprifon : — no hogs ; no 
poultry ; no dunghill ; no open drain ; no ftagnant 
yrater. As to mere refpiration, it can fcarcely be 
confidered as capable of producing the effefl to a 
degree worth notice, in a place ever fo little wider 
than a water-well, if open to the fky. 

As to facility of infpe&ion, it is obvious that 
the longer you make your Airing-yard, the lefs 
diftinft the view which the Infpe&or will have of 
a Prifoner at the further end of it. But the con(i- 
deration of the expence will be fufficient to put a 
flop to die extension of this fpace, long enough be- 
fore it has acquired length fufficient to prejudice 
the view. 

In fpeaking of the expence, I do not mean that 
of the ground : for that, everywhere but in a town, 
will be of little moment : but the expence of the 
walls. I fpeak not merely of the furrounding 
wall : for, whatever be the height of that wall, the 
feparation-walls, if there are any, cannot, as we 
fhall fee, have lefs. For the furrounding wall, ac- 
cording to the common plans atleaft, no ordinary

height will ruffice. But, by doubling the height 
of your wall, you much more than double the ex* 
pence: fince if you would have it ftand, yoti 
muft give it a proportionable increafe of thick* 
nefs. 

The height of the feparation -walls I have feid, 
muft not be lefs than that of the furrounding-wall— 
why ? becaufe if the former join on to the latter, 
they muft be of the fame height, or whatever height 
is given to the furrounding wall is fo much thrown 
away. The attempt, if any, will of courfe be 
made at that part where the wall is loweft, which 
will ferve as a ftep to any part which rifes above it. 
Let a wall of 12 foot be joined by another of 6 
foot: what is the obftacle to be furmounted ? Not 
one wall of 12 foot, but two walls of 6 foot each. 
In fortification, the ftrength of the whole is to be 
computed, not from the ftrength of the ftrongeft 
part, but from that of die weakeft. 

That the feparation -walls Should join the fur* 
rounding-wall, is not indeed abfolutely neceffary : 
but whether the dtfcontmuance could in any inftance 
be made productive of any faving upon the whole, 
feems rather questionable. They may indeed be 
left fhort of it to a certain diftance : the gap being 
fupplied by a ditch : to which the perfons meant to

approaching near enough for the purpofe of con- 
verfe, by a pallifade, which may be a very flight 
one, being intended rather to mark tranfgreffion 
than to prevent it. In the day time there will be 
no poffibility of approaching the ditch without de~ 
teftion, fince it will be full in view : at night there 
will be no motive, as there will be no perfons on 
the other fide to hold converfe with — no Prifohers 
in the yards. The ditch itfelf need not be conti- 
nued far on each fide of the wall : but the pallifade 
mull be continued all along : for if it were to ter- 
minate any where it would be ufelefs, and if it were 
to join the wall any where it would take fo much 
from the height. But the pallifade however flight 
would coft fomething : and, what is more material, 
the fpace between that and the wall would be fo 
much facrificed : and the greater the fpace, the more 
cxtenfive, and confequently more expenfive, muft 
fce the wall. If therefore the furrounding wall 
fhould not rife much above the height, which for 
the purpofe of preventing converfe it would be ne- 
ceffary to give to the feparation-walls* reducing the 
height of the latter by the help of the above expe- 
dient would not be worth the while.

But although no faving fliould be to be made in

What part that may be will be immediately con*

In a line with the Projefting front, continue the

But, to whatever walling there is before % no 
greater height need be given, than if there were no 
fuch thing as a prifon in the cafe. 

Thus much, fuppofing the neceffity of high 
walls and multiplied divifions. But, if my ideas be

It is that which runs parallel to, and between, the wall through 
which the entrance is cut, and that which forms on each fide a 
continuation of the Projecting Front. A fence in that p*rt is 
indeed Decenary : but inftead of a clofe wall it ought to he an

§ 21. APPROACH AND FENCES. 

IN the contrivance of the Fences I had of cowrie 
two claffes of perfons in view : the prifoners 
within ; and hoftile lgobs, or fuch individuals as 
might be difpofed to form plans or join in plots 
for the efcape of prifoners without. To thefe were 
added, in the contrivance of the Approach, the fub- 
ordinate Keepers, as likewife, though with a differ- 
ent view, the Chapel Vifitors. While the govern- 
ment or coreciQn of the firft three of thefe four 
defcriptions of perfons was to be provided for, the^ 
accommodation of the laft, thofe (till better thaiv 
gratuitous Infpe£tors, who, inflead of being paid, 
for infpe&ing, may be content to pay for it, mud 1 
not be negle&ed. 

The Approach, I make one only : a walled ave- 
nue cut through and from the furrounding wall ta 
the front of the building, thrown back purpofely 
to a certain diftance: fay, for example only, 24a 
foot : twice the diameter of the polygonal part of 
the building negledtingthe Proje&ing Front. Tha

at, and beyond it one of the (awe &7* at the fecQnd, for 
carriages to return by. At the very entrance the ave-

with the abovementiotied purpofes : it grows gradu-

on the other to that of the Gate-keeper, without' 
whofe concurrence the gates can afford him no • 
exit: and the prifon habit betraying him to both.

All the other prifons in London, that I recolle&i

No one can be more anxious than Mr. Howard 
to prevent every part of the building where pri- 
fonei? are lodged from Jiaving windows to the

3. The Avenue why controlled at the entrance? — 
The narrower the entrance the lefe the expence of 
the gates which clofe it, and the more perfectly 
it lies within the command of the Porter.. At the 
fpot where it reaches the building, were it no 
wider than it is at the entrance, it would fcarcc 
afford turning-room for carriages, much lefs the 
ftanding room which would be requifite at church- 
time. Were it of lefs width than the front, fb

niflies, would be loft.

Approach, it will be occupied by exterior offices 
and officers gardens. 

On the outfide all round, at a fmall diftance, 
(fay 12 foot) from the wall, runs a flight palifade 
of open work. The intermediate fpace receives 
four Centinels whofe paths -flank and crofs one 
another at the ends. The walls* inftead of form-

in general have a right to pafs, whether carriage- 
ways, or fimple foot-ways, are kept from approach*

At two of the corners the place of the palifad* 
might be occupied by two Guard-houfes : each 
with two fronts to flank and command the two

With a view to infpetfion, it might be applied to all fuch public 
eftabliihments as on account of their detonation, of their import- 
ance, their magnitude, and their deftru&bility, are particularly 
exposed to the clandestine enterprises of foreign emifiaries : fuch 
as public magazine* and Dock-yards. The Approach (hould be fo 
conftrucled, and the officers* houfes and (rations fo difpofed, 
that every ft range face ftiou'd have the gauntelope to run as it were 
through all their eyes, and that any inftance of negligence on this 
head on the part of any one of them, Jhould be expofed to the 
observation of all the reft. Had a plan like this been purfued in 
Plymouth Rope- yard, the fad deftru&ion to which that important 
magaaine was devoted in 1776 by the hands of a wretched in- 
cendiary, might perhaps never have had place. 

With a view to defence again/} oftn boftilay, it might be ap- 
plied not only to every prifon, but to every other building, public 
or private, which by the provocation it holds out to rapacity or 
popular antipathy, is liable to become the object of lawlefs vio- 
lence. A Money-bank, a great Corn-magazine, a place of worihip 
belonging to any obnoxious fee),' a new erected machine which 
appears to threaten a fudden reduction in the price or the demand 
of any kind of labour—- may afford fo many examples. With thefe 
precautions Dingley's Saw-mill, for inftance, for which the nation 
was charged with fo heavy an indemnity, would probably have 
cfcaped.

Over thefe impure methods of obtaining heat, 
the ventilative is capable of poffefling a great advan- 
tage. The air which is to receive the heat being 
continually renewed, may be brought from the pure 
atmofphere without ; and inftead of being ftagnant, 
ilows in in a perpetually changing ftream. Inftead 
of burning in one part while it is freezing in 
another, the air of the room is thus rendered 
throughout of the fame temperature. A fuccef- 
iion of cold air from without is the lefs neceffary, 
j2ls the warm air, what there is of it, is not lefs 
pure :* and this pure though heated air, if introdu- 
ced, as it ought, to be, from the lower part of the 
room helps to drive up before it, to that part of the 
joom which is above the level of the refpiration, 
that part of the air which by having been breathed 
already, has been rendered the lefs fit for breathing. 

By the Pennfylvanian ftoves thefe advantages 
were however poffefled in but an imperfect de-

vi-fion muft be made in the conftru&ion of the

it any more. To produce in that Chupch 40 de-

Will the diftribution thus made be fufficiently 
minute ? Experience alone can decide with cer- 
tainty. Of the three piles of Cells correfponding 
toeachftove, the middle one, if there were any dif- 
ference, fhould receive more heat than the other 
two. But this difference 1 fhould expe<9t to find 
little or nothing, and if it were but fmall* it would 
be rather a convenience than otherwifc : varieties 
of temperature might thus beadjufted to differences

and good behaviour. 

At its exit from the Warming-chamber, fhall 
the heated air be fuffered to take its, own courfe, 
or fhall it meet with a tube to conduct it to the 
part at which it begins to beofufe? This too 
would be matter of experiment, and the experiment 
might be performed without any confiderable ex=- 
.pence. Terminating in the neareft part of the In-

1 4 foot in length. For the materials, the worfl

the diftribution were not found equal enough, they 
might be made to terminate in a circumferential one

equal apertures, the fum of which fhould be equal,

Why tbife radial tubes ? fince, as far as they ex-

IT maybe reduced to three principal heads: 1- 
Making the fame apartment ferve for every 
thing : 2. Making the Cells capable of ferving for 
two, three, or four inhabitants inftead of one : 3. 
Making them no larger than is neceflary. 

1. Six feverai modes ofa&ion or exiftence are in- 
cident to the perfons for whofe reception the building 
is particularly defigned : to work, to eat, tojleep, to 
pray, to be purvjhed, and to be nurfed. One and the 
fame place ferves my prifoners for all of them. If the 
reftri&ion is fevere, it is not unexampled. In our 
own three kingdoms it is the lot of many hundred 
thoufands, perhaps of fome millions, of better men, 
I fee nothing that fhould hinder a man from 
working where he cats,workingwherehefleeps, eat- 
ing where he works, eating where he lleeps,. fleec- 
ing where he works, or fleeping where he eats. All 
this and more, it has more than once happened 
to myfelf.to do in the fame room for a confiderable 
- time together,. and I cannot iay lever found any 
bad confequence from ik

I conceive it not altogether impoffible for a man, 
dot even for a Chriftian to pray where he does all 
this: Chrift and his Apoftles did fo. Synagogues 
c^repted, neither Chrift nor his Apoftles knew what 
it was to pray in any confecrated place. 

Not that for all this I have any objection to that 
rite. It feems neither difficult to fhew that it does 
fervice to religion, nor eafy, if poflible,tofhew that 
it does diflervice. 

In my plan [ accordingly admit a confecrated 
fpace, and that by no means a confined one : a 
place in which no operation that does not minifter 
to religion fhall be carried on. All I contend for 
is that it is not neceffary that the Prifoners ftiould 
themfelves be fituated in that place : tiiat it is fuffi- 
cient to every purpofe if, without being fituated 
there, they fee and hear what paffes there. The 
place where the Minifter is fituated, and where 
the more confiderable part of the auditory are fitu- 
ated, the place to which the eyes and the thoughts 
of the Prifoners are turned, is holy ground. 

As little reafon do I fee why the* fame place 
fhouldnot ferve them for being punifhed in. Se- 
parate apartments for this purpofe arefurely of all 
luxuries one that can beft be fpared.*

As to nurfing, whether upon the common plans 
of conftru&ion, feparate rooms for that ufe wer£ 
neceflary, is not ftriftly to the purpofe here. 
The bed-chamber* being all fingle ones, I #lo 
not immediately apprehend what advantage the 
patients were to get by being removed out of 
thbfe^rooms into others, unlefs it were that of hav- 
ing fires in their rooms, a benefit which without 
fluffing their quarters they might have received 
from portable ftoves. A portable ftove not only 
cofts lefs than a room, but is fooner made. Were 
the Infirmary-rooms at any time to be filled, it 
would be rather an aukward circumftance for a 
patient in a high fever to wait for attendance till 
an additional Infirmary could be built and in rea- 
dinefs to receive him. At Mofer and Jackfon's, a 
good portable ftove may be had upon the pureft 

father, t character not unknown in thofe days, caufed two ferula* 
to be made on purpofe. The fum of each culprit's tranfgreflion 
was infciibcd upon the in ft rumen t of his puni foment: and care 
was taken that in the corre&ion of him who had ftrayed to St. 
John's, the ferula ihould not be employed which was deftined to 
wipe out the guilt that had been contracted inTothill-Ficlds. I 
remember the boys, the father, and the flicks. The mode of 
chaftifement was, it muft be confefled linking enough, but was it 
a neceflary one ? As neceflary at lead as it would have been to 
. have Imilt rooms to punim them in . And of the two contrivances, 
building a room, and engraving a couple of words upon the head 
of *a ftick, which is the nwft expenfive ?

ferior quality, and lefs elaborate contrivance, pro- 
bably at a ftill cheaper rate. 

But be this as it may in the Penitentiary-town: 
defigned by the A&, ill a Panopticon Penitentiary- 
houfe, nurfing rooms on purpofe would be unnecef- 
fary beyond difpute. Rooms better adapted to that 
ufe than every Cell is ©f itfelf, or even fo well, can 
hardly be fhewn any where. By nurfing-rooms on 
purpofe I mean rooms, which when they are not put 
to this ufe are not put to any other. For as to par- 
ticular Cells, more particularly well fuited • to 
the purpofe of an Infirmary, than other Cells, 
fuch have already been pointed out, and under 
that very name;* but the convenience they 
would afford to the fick, k no reafon why, when 
there are no fick, they fliould remain unoccupied. 
Indeed the whole of the upper ftory of Cells is pe- 
culiarly well adapted to this ufe. None of the air 
that has vifited any one of thefe Cells ever vifits 
any other part of the whole building : and being 
fo much nearer than any others to the roof, they 
can receive a portable ftove and its chimney, with 
fo much the lefs inconvenience and expence.f

where the only danger is a poffibility of its importation by goods

purpofe : he will a'fo diftinguifl* with equal facility fuch of the 
ei pedients as being adapted to oppofite purposes would require to 
be difcarded or changed. As to comfort, amufcment, luxury in alt 
Its Jbapes, it is fufficient to hint that there is nothing of that (brr 
that need be excluded from fuch an hotel any more than from any 
Other* But cyery thing of luxury apart, what would not Howard

under the eye of an Infpe6tor, which they can- 
not be in thefe rooms. Therefore there are to be 
other rooms for working in. 

Have any notions about health and airinefs con- 
tributed to this opinion about the neceffity of dif- 
ferent rooms for the different partsof the twenty-four 
hours? I am not certain : though fomething to this 
effeft I think I have obferved in the publications 
of Mr. Howard. • But even under the common 
Penitentiary difcipline, I (hould not think any fuch 
multiplication neceflary : much lefs under the plan 
of management here propofed. To how many 
hundred thoufands of his Majefty's honeft fubje£ts 
is fuch luxury unknown ! Even among perfons 
fomewhat above the level of theloweft clafs, what is 
more common than to have but one room, not only 
for one perfon, but for a whole family, man, wife 
and children ? and not only working, and fleeping 
and eating, but cooking to be performed in it. 
Among the Irifh cottars, as we learn from Mr. 
Arthur Young, that is among the bulk of the Irifh 
people, one room is the only receptacle for man, 
wife, children, dog and fwine. Has that one room 
fo much as a fingle window in it, much lefs oppo- 
fite windows, or any aperture but the door? In 
towns where one room forms the fole dwelling- 
place of a whole family, has not that room clofed 
windows in it ? Is there any commanding power

$ 24* Economy of Conftrufthn. £35 

to enforce the opening of any of thofe windows? 
Does not the averfion to cold forbid it? Are they 
fo much as capable of being opened, if at all, for 
more than half their length ? — and that the lower 
half?*— 

Let me not be miftakea. Far be it from me to 
propofe the manner in which the common people 
Jive through ignorance, as a proper model to be 
purfued by thofe who have the good fortune to be 
poffefled of more intelligence. Far be it from 
me to infinuate that a bad regimen ought to be 
prefcribed only becaufe itispra&ifed. All I meaa : 
is, that the degree of airinefs moft frequent in the 
dwellings of the greater part of the people is infe- 
rior, and much inferior, to that which might b^ 
obtained without multiplication of rooms, even ac- 
cording :to the hitherto received mode of conftruc- 
tion for Penitentiary-houfes, and according to the 
mode of management hitherto purfued in them. 
In prifons even fo managed, the inhabitants would 
not in this refpeft be worfe off, but much better off, 
than the common run of men at liberty. Yet 

* Were ventilation the object, tbe upper faih would be the one 
to open in preference, efpscially where the higheft part of the 
lower one is not above the level of the organs of refpiration. Were 
it not for accidental giifts, fa much of the air as is above the aper- 
ture might remain for ever unchanged It may perhaps have been 
•partly on this cortfideration that in Mr. Howard's and the Wymond* 
.ham plan* the holes fcrviagfor window* are .placed So high.

even in this refpefik how inferior are feme of the 
V»oft approved plans of conftru&ion incomparifon 
of the one now propofed!* There, when yoo 
fliut out rain or {how, you fliut out air. There, 
rain or not rain, windows open or not open, you 
have frcih air in plenty : in much greater plenty 
than is ufual in a palace. 

2. Of fuch part of the faving as refults from. the 
fubftituting a fteady plan of mitigated feclufion in 
fmall apartments to an alternation of folitude and 
promifcuous intercourfe, nothing farther need be 
faid here : it has been fully vindicated in a preceding 
fe6tfon. 

3. Of the wafte of room obfervable in the com- 
mon flans, a great part is to be placed to the ac- 
count of height. Not more than eleven feet, but 
not lefs than nine, is the height prefcribed by the 
Penitentiary Aft.f The Wyrnondham houfe 
takes the medium between thefe two extremes.J 
Wafte it may well be called. I fufpe&ed as 
much at the time of writing the letters. I 
fpeak now with decifion, and upon the clear- 
eft views. In refpedk of health, height of ceiling 
is no otherwife of ufe than as a fort of fuccedi- 
neum to or means of ventilation. In either view 
it is befide the purpofe : as a fuccedaneum, in*?

Take a Panopticon Penitentiary-houfe on onfc
