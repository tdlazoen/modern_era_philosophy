PREFACE. 



I began the following translation of the First Part of 
Goethe's Faust some time before the publication of Bayard 
Taylor's masterly rendition of the poem, and before I had 
any knowledge of the fa<5l that such a work was then in 
progress. 

No thought of publication dwelt at that time in my mind. 
My life-long enjoyment of the beauties of the original, and 
the desire to render them accessible to the friends whom I 
have gathered around me in this my adopted country, by 
producing a translation at once more metrical and more lit- 
eral than any then known to me, were the only motives that 
led to the beginning and urged the continuance of the pres- 
ent work. 

I offer no excuses for an undertaking which, coming after 
Mr. Taylor's, may seem superfluous; nor will I apologize 
for its many imperfections. 

A strange fascination, experienced only by those who en- 
ter deeply into the study of Goethe's master-work, urged 
me onward even in the very midst of the discouragement 
caused by the appearance of Mr. Taylor's version. 

Far from intending to place my work on the same level, I 
offer it simply as a tribute to Goethe's genius, as an illustra- 
tion of this fascination which would not allow me to relin- 
quish my self-appointed task even after I had become par- 
tially convinced that its accomplishment was no longer a 
necessity as regarded the execution of my original purpose. 

No notes are appended, although it has been the custom

iv PREFACE. 

of most translators to add such. So many profound scholars 
and commentators have explained every seemingly obscure 
passage of the poem, that it would be presumption, indeed, 
were I to attempt to add aught further on my own account. 

Reluctantly, lingeringly, I now part with my work. It 
represents over fifteen years of faithful thought and study ; 
and in sending it forth it is as if I bade farewell forever to 
a dear friend, the companion of many a happy hour. 

As far as I have been able to ascertain, this is the first time 
that one of Goethe's own countrymen has attempted to 
translate " Faust'* into the English language. May the 
American people kindly receive his rendition of the ''great- 
est work of the greatest of German poets'* !

AN GOETHE'S MUSE. 



" Der Morgen kam! '* Es scheuchten deine Schritte 

Den Zauber, der das traumende Jahrhundert, 

In nacht'ge Finsterniss gehiillt, umgab. 

Die graue Feindin der Gedankenfreiheit, 

Die arge Fee, die jeden Fortschritt mindert, 

Der alles Thun des regen Menschengeistes 

Zuwider ist, hielt es in Schlafes Banden. 

â€” Doch nun, zum Licht erwacht, den Aberglauben 

Des Denkens abgestreift, verjiingt, die Adern 

Mit neuer Kraft, mit frischem Blut geschwellt, 

Erschafft es Ihn, den Herrlichen, den Meister. 

Gepflegt von deinen Gotterhanden, ragt Er 

Zur Riesengrosse, einzig, unerreichbar. 

Von hoh'rer Macht erkoren fiir Aeonen 

Die hochste Macht hienieden auszuuben. 

Du staunest deines eig'nen Werk's, und ruhest. 

Vor deinem Throne, Gottin, knie* ich nieder : 
O, leite du die angstlich-schwacben Schritte 
Auf jenen Pfad, den Er dereinst betreten ! 
Verhiille mir nicht deines Wesens Anmuth ! 
Send'einen Strahl nur deiner Glorie nieder, 
Begeist're mich, dass ich mit klarem Sinne 
In fremder, doch verwandter Sprache Wohllaut 
Sein grosstes Lied mit Ehrfurcht iibertrage, 
Dass es, ein Abklanz jener ew'gen Worte 
In mild' rem Licht erbluhe dem Verstandniss 
Der Neuen Welt : Ein Zeugniss Seines Schaffens.

Und fordere den Vorsatz zum Gelingen.

DEDICATION. 



Again ye float, weird forms, before my vision. 

Which erst appeared unto my veiled eyes. 
Shall I attempt to hold your dim tradition? 

Still does my heart that fond delusion prize? 
Ye crowd yet closer ! Then fulfill your mission, 

As 'round me ye from mists and shadows rise; 
My breast is stirred, with youthful pulses bounding, 
Thrilled by the magic breath your host surrounding^. 

Of happy days glad recollections bringing, 
Loved shades arise with you and live again ; 

And, legend-like, to memory faintly cfinging. 

First Love draws near, and Friendship in his train; 

The pain grows new, the plaint, in sadness ringing, 
Life's mazy course recounts in pensive strain. 

And names the Good who, by ill-fortune banished 

From beauteous hours, long, long ago have vanished. 

Dumb is to them my later inspiration, 

Those souls to whom I sang my earlier lay; 

Dispersed the friendly throng throughout creation, 
Ah, the first echo e'en has died away ! 

My grief pleads to an unknown generation, 
Their very plaudits my poor heart dismay : 

And those whom once my song had cheered and gladdened. 

If still they live, rove through the world now saddened. 

And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning 
Toward yonder spirit-world, so grave, so still ; 

My whispering song, now fleeting, now returning, 
Holds, like -^olian harp, its 'wildering thrill; 

A shudder chills me, tears start hot and burning, 
More tender, gentler thoughts the stern heart fill ; 

What I possess seems far away and distant. 

What I have lost grows real and existent.

PRELUDE UPON THE STAGE. 



Manager, Dramatic Poet, Merryman. 

Manager, 
You two, who oft have aided me 
In my distress and tribulation. 
Say, think you that our speculation 
In German lands will prosperous be ? 
The crowd to please I alwa)rs am quite ready, 
Especially since it lives and lets me live. 
The posts are set, the boards laid firm and steady, 
And all await the show that we shall give. 
E'en now their lifted brows have me admonished 
That they, sedately, hope to be astonished. 
I know well how the folk to interest. 
But thii^ hadiMsrer-snch perplexed appearance ; 
True, they are not accustomed to the b^t, 
But they have read, with fearful perseverance. 
How shall we act, to make all fresh and new 
And full of meaning, yet delightsome, too ? 
For well I like to see the mass that rushes. 
As in a stream it crowds our booth to face. 
With mighty throes, and oft repeated, pushes 
And surges through the narrow gate of grace ; 
At daylight still, ere " four*' has sounded, 
The ticket box to reach each fights and strives ; 
As bakers' doors for loaves in famine are surrounded 
So now, for tickets, they would risk their lives. 
Upon such various people works this wonder 
The Bard alone ; to-day, friend, try it, yonder ! 

Dramatic Poet. 
Oh, speak not of that motley crowd, still thronging. 
At whose approach tjie Muse flies far away ! 
Hide from my gaze the scene, my vision wronging, 
Which drags us, helpless, in the whirl astray.

Nay, for that heavenly nook my soul is longing, 
Where, for the Bard, shines forth joy's purest ray, 
Where Love and Friendship, Godlike hands extending, 
Create within our hearts a bliss unending. 

Ah, all our thoughts, from deepest bosom welling, 
Which lips have stammered forth in shy alarm, 
Now failing, now perhaps success compelling. 
Enfolds the Moment with its mighty arm. 
Oft, only after years of rest, excelling 
At last, revealed stands their perfect charm. 
The Glittering but for moments brief remaineth. 
The True alone posterity retaineth. 

Merryman, 
Posterity ! Do not the subject mention ! 
If to po^jerity /'d pay attention. 
Who for this race would iÂ«Ki cxeaXt ? 
For that they will have, never ceasing. 
The presence of a fine lad, too, is pleasing 
Methinks, and well to contemplate. 
He who his thoughts can genially impart. 
Will never fret 'gainst peoples' whims and fashions ; 
A wider sphere he seeks, his art 
Is surer thus to sway their passions. 
Therefore be brave, exemplary your way ; 
Let Fancy come, by all her train surrounded. 
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, Passion have full sway, 
But, mark you. Folly too must be unbounded ! 

Manager, 
Chiefly, however, must there action be ! 
One comes to look, one mostly likes to see. 
If deeds are spun before their eyes, soul-stirring. 
So that the crowd, astounded, looketh on. 
Then have you gained their good will, none demurring. 
You are beloved by every one. 
The mass is best subdued with heaping measure ; 
Each one at last selects his favorite bit. 
Who offers much, brings unto all a treasure,

And each departs made happy by your wit. 
Play you a piece, in pieces separate it ! 
Such a ragout, they'll highly rate it ; 
It is not hard to serve, is easy to invent. 
What use that you a whole intact present ? 
The Public pluck to pieces and berate it. 

Dramatic Poet, 
You cannot feel how mean, how wretched such a trade, 
How ill this suits the artist's real mission. 
To hold the mess those bunglers made 
As Maxim, is, I fear me, your ambition. 

Manager. 
Such a reproach does not at all offend ; 
He who his work good speed would lend, 
Must choose for it the tools most fitting. 
Bethink you that you have soft wood for splitting, 
And only look for whom you write ! 
While one comes bored, another wight 
Hastes satiate from the banquet's sensual pleasure, 
Another, his the saddest plight, 
Who reads the daily papers at his leisure. 
All hurry thoughtlessly, as to a masquerading. 
Curiosity alone their steps doth start ; 
The ladies treat, their toilets and themselves parading. 
And without pay, each acts her part. 
What dream you, on your artist elevation ? 
What makes a full house glad, all told? 
Your patrons view from closer station, 
Half are they coarse, half are they cold ; 
One, after the performance, seeks the cards, 
Another a wild night with a lewd wench amuses. 
Why vex then, poor and foolish bards. 
For such an end the gracious Muses ? 
I tell you, give but more, more always ; this we need, 
And then your goal lies e' er before you plainly ; 
Seek to confound your people mainly, 

To please them is a task indeed * 

What ails you now ? Ecstatic bliss, or anguish ?

Dramatic Poet 
Go, thou, and seek another slave to find ! 
What ? Shall the bard forfeit his right, his mind, 
The Human Right which nature gave his soul. 
For thy sake, in sheer wantonness, and languish ? 
How doth he every bosom vanquish ? 
How every element hold in control ? 
Is it not Harmony, that from the bosom flows. 
And to his heart leads back Earth's joys and woes? 
When nature the eternal thread, now winding. 
Now turning, idly on its spindle throws. 
When all creation, in discordance blinding 
* Mong fretful strains its chaos shows. 
Who so divides the equal order ever, 
Life-giving, that it throbs in rhythmic forms ? 
Who calls to common sanction every true endeavor 
Where it in grandest chords the spirit warms ? 
Who bids the tempest rage to wildest passion ? 
In earnest souls the evening glow arise? 
Who strews the flowers of spring in tender fashion 
On paths where the beloved one hies ? 
Who wreathes unmeaning leaves in crowns, descending 
On honored brows, each merit to reward? 
Who holds Olympus ? Gods in union blending ? 
Man's power alone, revealed in the Bard ! 

Merryman, 
Then task you now those powers enthralling. 
Engaging in your poet-calling 
As one a love-adventure oft pursues ! 
By chance one meets, one feels, one stops to muse, 
And step by step becomes entangled ; 
The bliss increases, then the chords are jangled, 
Now all is rapture, then comes dark despair, 
And lo ! a full romance, before one is aware. 
Let's give a play of like consistence ! 
Reach only forth into man's full existence ! 
'Tis lived by each, though understood by few, 
And where you touch, of interest and new.

In motley scenes light faintly gleaming, 
Through fraud a spark of truth now beaming, 
The finest potion thus we brew, 
By which the world 's refreshed and formed anew. 
Then comes youth's lairest flower and charm, collecting 
Before your play, and lists the revelation. 
Then every tender mind draws near, selecting 
Its melancholy food from your creation, 
Then this and that emotion will be stirred. 
That which within his heart each one has heard. 
They're moved alike to smiles and tears in moods impassioned. 
They honor still your flight, illusion's gleam adore ; 
'Tis hard to please a mind matured and fashioned, 
One growing yet is grateful evermore. 
Dramatic Poet 
Then give me back the times, long vanished, 
When I myself was yet unformed. 
When thronging melodies, now banished. 
In ceaseless springs the bosom warmed. 
When mists the world veiled from my vision, 
The bud gave hope of wonders rare. 
When gathered I the flowerets fair. 
That richly filled those vales Elysian. 
I had enough, yet own6d naught : 
The thirst for truth, the bliss illusion brought. 
Give back unchanged the heart's emotion. 
The solemn joy akin to pain, 
The power of hate, love's pure devotion, 
Oh, give me back my youth again! 
Merryman, 
Of youth, perhaps, thou 'It stand in need, my worthy friend, 
When enemies in battle press thee. 
When from thy neck fair arms depend 
Wherewith bewitching girls caress thee, 
When garlands far beyond the strife 
To hard-won goal thy steps are beckoning. 
When circling dance, with pleasure rife 
And night carousal, ends the reckoning :

But the ^miliar lyre with grace 

And strength to play, sweet strains evolving, 

And in a self-appointed race 

All tender errors gently solving, 

There, ag6d Sirs, your duty lies, 

And not the less does our respect then bind us. 

For age doth not seem childish in our eyes. 

But ever genuine children dotli it find us. 

Manager, 
You 've bandied words enough at present, 
Let me perceive your deeds begun! 
While compliments you turn so pleasant. 
Some useful work might well be done. 
What need to speak of Mood, thus, prating ? 
'Twill ne*er appear while you delay. 
If you are poets, by your rating. 
Then bid the Muse your call obey! 
Full well you know what we require â€” 
Strong drinks to sip is our desire; 
Come, brew the mixture now, full soon! 
What is not done to-day, next mom will not call done. 
And lose no day in hesitation; 
Resolve the Possible should seize 
By forelock with determination. 
It cannot gain its liberation. 
And, since it must, works on with ease. 
You know our German boards permit it 
That each one try whatever he may; 
To-day, then, spare not for our play 
Machines or scenes that will best fit it. 
Use you the great and lesser heavenly light, 
The stars dispose of at your pleasure. 
Of water, fire, without much measure, 
Of rocks, birds, beasts, grant us a sight. 
Thus pace, within this narrow boarded sphere. 
Creation's circle fer and near. 
And, led by thoughtful fancy's spell. 
Speed you from Heaven, through Earth, to Hell!

PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN. 

The Lord ; the Heavenly Host ; later Mephis- 

topheles. 

The three Archangels come forward* 

Raphael. 
The sun, in ancient manner chiming 
With brother spheres in rival song, 
Rolls, his predestined journey climbing, 
With thunder- tread his path along. 
This sight to angels power lendeth. 
Though none may ken his mystic way, 
The lofty work in beauty blendeth 
Unfathomed, as on earliest day. 

GabrieL 
And swift and swift, past all divining, 
The splendor of the Earth is whirled. 
Anon in Eden-brightness shining, 
Again in night chaotic hurled ; 
The ocean in broad streams foams, boiling 
Around the rocks' deep-founded base. 
And rock and sea are onward toiling 
In swift, eternal, spheric race. 

MichaeL 

And tempests surge in emulation 

From sea to land, from land to sea, 

^ . . . . 

And forge, in furious agitation, 

A chain of deepest energy. 

There flames a flashing desolation 

Before the thunder's crashing way. 

But, Lord, in silent adoration 

Thy servants praise Thy gentle Day. 

The Three Together. 

The sight to angels power lendeth, 

Since none may ken Thy mystic Way, 

And all Thy grand creation blendeth 

In beauty, as on Earliest Day.

Mephistopheles, 
Since Thou, oh Lord, draw'st near to us once more, 
And ask' St how all things are with us progressing. 
And as my face didst like to see of yore, 
So, 'midst Thy servants, seest Thou me in passing. 
Forgive, I cannot form my speech demurely, 
Should even all this circle look with scorn ; 
My pathos would to laughter move Thee, surely, 
Hadst Thou not long ago all mirth forsworn. 
In suns and worlds there's naught for my commenting, 
I only notice men themselves tormenting. 
The world's small god fore'er is of the self-same kind, 
And, as on earliest day, of odd, capricious mind. 
His life would be more worth the living, 
But for that little gleam of heavenly light. Thy giving ; 
He calls it Reason, but pollutes 
Its use by being beastlier than the brutes : 
He seems to me, Your Kindly Grace permitting, 
Like a cicada, long-legged, jumping, flitting. 
Which always flies, and flying bounds, 
Yet mainly in the grass its ditty sounds ; 
If only he would stay there and be merry ! 
In every dung his nose he needs must bury. 

The Lord. 
Hast thou no new communication ? 
Com' St always with denunciation ? 
Naught that will suit thee doth the earth possess ? 

Mephistopheles. 
No, Lord ! I find there now, as always, great distress. 
My pity for men's woes grows daily deeper, stronger, 
I may not even tease the wretches longer. 

The Lord, 
Know' St Faust? 

Mephistopheles. 

The Doctor Faust ?

Mephistopheles. 
P'orsooth ! His service then is most erratic. 
No earthly food and drink suits this fanatic ; 
Far drives him ceaseless aspiration : 
He is half conscious of his wild unrest ; 
Of Heaven he asks the fairest constellation, 
And all the highest joys at earth* s behest ; 
The Near and Far of all creation 
Contenteth not the wildly surging breast. 

The Lord. 
E*en if confused he now in homage bends, 
Soon into clearness will I gently lead him. 
The gardener knows, when spring its verdure lends. 
That flowers and fruits the future hath decreed him. 

Mephistopheles, 
What bet you ? To perdition will I speed him, 
If you will grant me my desire 
Along my road to smoothly lead him ? 

The Lord, 
While earthly thoughts his deeds inspire, 
So long I give thee my permission. 
Men err as long as they aspire ! 

Mephistopheles, 
I thank you ; I Ve no disposition 
To have with dead folks any dealings. 
The full, fresh cheeks of youth far better suit my feelings. 
I *m not at home to corpses any day. 
As cat with mouse, I like a living prey. 

The Lord, 
Enough ! 'Tis left to thy discretion ! 
Draw off this spirit from his being's source, 
And, canst thou gain of him possession. 
Lead him with thee thy downward course, 
But stand ashamed, if forced to declare : 
A good man, in his darkest aspiration. 
Is of the right path always well aware.

Mepkistopheles. 
Ah well ! 'Twill be of short duration ! 
I do not view ray bet with consternation. 
And when my aims reach consummation, 
Then, by Your leave, I '11 have my triumph's share. 
Dust shall he eat, and like such fare. 
As did the noted serpent, my relation. 

The Lord, 
Do as thou wilt ! Though thou 'st defied Me, 
Thy kind in Me did never hate inspire ; 
Of all the spirits who denied Me, 
The rogue's the one of whom I least do tire. 
In man's activity a wish for comfort lurketh. 
Uninterrupted ease he learns to crave, 
And therefore gladly give I him the knave 
Who spurs, excites, and, as a devil, worketh. 

But ye, true sons of the Eternal, 

Rejoice in beauty ever rich, supernal ! 
Let the Creative Quickening Power Divine 
Surround ye with sweet bonds of love, alluring. 
And what in wavering vision floats, enshrine 
Within your thoughts, immutable, enduring ! 

( The Heaven closes y the Archangels separate,) 

Mephistopheles, {alone.) 
At times I like the Ancient One to see, 
And try not to dispute with Him, or cavil. 
'Tis kind of such a Mighty Lord as He 
To treat thus humanly the very devil.

THE FIRST PART OF THE TRAGEDY. 

Night. 

(/Â« a loffyy archedy narrow ^ Gothic chamber , Faust, restless in 
his armchair at the desk.^ 

Faust, 
I've studied now Philosophy, 
And Jurisprudence ; Medicine, 
And e'en, alas ! Theology ; 
Pursued them all, with ardor keen ! 
And here, poor fool, I stand at last, 
No wiser now than in the past : 
Am Doctor called, yea, Magister am I. 
And nearly ten years have passed by 
Since, up and down, with zigzag tread 
I've by the nose my scholars led â€” 
And see how vain is all our learning ! 
This in my heart like fire is burning. 
'Tis true, I am wiser than those foppish creatures. 
Doctors and Magisters, Writers and Preachers ; 
Scruples or Doubts no more distress me, 
Nor Hell nor Devil can ever oppress me â€” 
But then, no joy in my bosom is glowing, 
I dp not assume to know aught worth knowing, 
I do not assume by my own exertion 
To better mankind, or cause their conversion. 
Nor own I either goods or gold, 
Nor worldly pomp nor glory hold. 
No dog such life would longer fancy! 
Helhce have I turned to Necromancy, 
That I, by spirit-aid and speech 
Full many a mystery might reach, 
That I, with bitter sweat, no more 
Need prate and talk of unknown lore, 
That I the secret can explore

Which holds the world's most inward core,

Nor longer deal in empty speeches. 

Oh, full-orbed moon! Would'st shed thy glow 

The last time here upon my woe, 

Thou, for whose gentle midnight beam 

I at my desk oft watched: Thy gleam 

On books and scroll fell tenderly. 

When, wistful friend, thou cam'st to me! 

Ah, could I upon mountain-height 

Rejoice for aye in thy dear light, 

Round mountain-caverns with spirits hieing. 

O'er meadows fair in thy twilight flying, 

And, freed from mists of erudition, 

Bath'd in thy dew, find life's fruition! 

Woe ! Am I still in prison bound ? 
Accursed hole, damp, walled around. 
Where even the dear, heavenly light 
Through painted panes greets dull the sight; 
Shut in by heaps of books, each tome 
Worm-eaten, dust defiled, and old. 
And, stretching to the vaulted dome. 
With smoky paper girt, and mold; 
With glasses, boxes here and there. 
With instruments ranged round about. 
And ancient chattels peeping out â€” 
Such is thy world! A precious world to sharel 

And askest thou, wherefore thy heart 
Flutters within in anxious strife. 
Why such inexplicable smart 
Clogs every impulse of thy life? 
Instead of living nature's bloom 
Which God to man gave as his own, 
Surrounds thee smoke, corruption's gloom, 
The bones of brutes, and skeleton.

Arise! Fly! Into the wide land! 

And this book, full of mystery, 

Direct from Nostradamus* hand, 

Is 't not sufficient guide for thee? 

The planets' course wilt then discern, 

And when thou'rt led by nature's hand 

Shall dawn within thee power to learn 

How spirits spirits understand. 

In vain, that this dry brooding here 

Expounds the sacred signs to thee: 

Ye hover, spirits, 'round me, near, 

Give answer, if ye list to me! 

(^He opens the book and perceives 
the sign of Macrocosm,^ 

Ha! As I gaze, what ecstasy doth steal 

O'er all my senses, each in rapture steeping! 

A youthful, hallowed, living joy I feel 

Fresh glowing through my veins and pulses sweeping! 

Was it a God, who wrote this mystic sign, 

Which soothes the inward agitation. 

Which thrills with joy each heart- vibration. 

And, with mysterious sway, benign. 

Unveils around me all the wonders of Creation ? 

Am I a God? All grows so clear! 

In these pure lines, to me unsealed, 

Great Nature, working in my presence, is revealed. 

Now only I conceive what means the Seer: 
'* The world of spirits is not fastened; 
Thy sense is barred, thy heart is dead! 
Up, scholar, bathe with ardor chastened. 
The earthly breast in Morning Red! " 

(^He contemplates the sign.) 

How to a Whole each part entwists! 

Each in the other works, exists ! 

How heavenly powers now up, now down are massing, 

Each other golden vessels passing! 

On fragrant pinions they, bliss-sending. 

From Heaven to Earth their way are wending. 

In harmony through the All extending!

Ah, what a sight! Yet â€” it is but a sight! 

Where can I grasp thee, Nature infinite? 

Ye bosoms, where? Ye springs of life's foundation. 

Upon which Heaven and Earth depend, 

Whereto the withered breast doth tend â€” 

Ye spring, ye nurse, and I am near starvation ? 

(^He turns tJie pages indignantly, and perceives 
the sign of the Spirit of the Earth,) 

How differently affects my soul this sign! 

Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer; 

Already grows my vision clearer. 

Already glow I as with wine. 

To dare the world I feel a strength unfailing, 

To bear the joys and woes on earth prevailing. 

To strive with storms my path assailing, 

And stand 'mid shipwreck's crash with heart unquailing. 

Clouds gather over me â€” 

The moon conceals her light â€” 

The lamp's extinguished ! 

Mists rise ! â€” Bright, ruddy rays are darting 

Around my head â€” There floats 

A shudder downward from the vault 

And seizes me ! 

Spirit invoked ! I feel thee hovering ' round ! 

Reveal thyself ! 

Ha, in my heart what fierce rebound ! 

Toward new sensation 

All senses struggle in agitation ! 

Completely has my heart to thee surrendered ! 

Thou must ! Thou must ! E 'en should my life be tendered !

Spirit 

With mighty traction thou 'st impelled me, 

Thy suction from my sphere compelled me, 

And now _ 

Faust 

Woe! Thee I cannot bear! 

Spirit 
Thou breathest a panting supplication 
To listen to my voice, my countenance to see; 
Thy soul's entreaty moveth me: 
Here am I ! â€” What weak trepidation 

Thee, Superhuman, grasps? Where is the souPs proud aim? 
Where is the breast that in itself a world did frame, 
And held and cherished ; which, with rapture tingling, 
Thought to expand, with us, the spirits, mingling? 
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice to me did peal, 
Who to me pressed with all his power and zeal ? 
Art thou he who thus, by my presence haunted, 
In all the depths of life is daunted, 
A frightened, writhing, cringing worm? 

Faust 
I yield to thee, thou flaming image? 
T is I, 't is Faust, of kindred lineage! 

Spirit. 
In the tide of life, in action's storm. 
Up and down I wave, 
Weaving to and fro! 
Birth and the Grave, 
An eternal flow 
A web e'er turning, 
A life all burning â€” 

Thus work I the swift whirling loom of old Time, 
And fashion the Deity's garment sublime! 

Faust, 
Thou, who the world to range inclin'st. 
Thou active Spirit, how near I feel to thee! 

Spirit, 
Thou 'rt like the spirit thou divin'st.

Faust, {breaking down,) 



{A knock,) 



Oh death! I know â€” this is my famulus â€” 
My dearest happiness now has vanished! 
My visions, in their fullness banished, 
The prosy sneak disturbs them thus! 

(^Enier Wagner, in dressing gown and night cap, 
with a lamp in his hand. Faust turns fretfully,) 

Wagner, 
Forgive! I heard you just declaiming; 
You surely read aloud an old Greek play? 
To profit by this art I 'm always aiming. 
For much it counts the present day. 
I 've often heard it said, a player 
Could teach a priest how he should read his prayer. 

Fau^t, 
Yes, when the priest a player is already. 
As this from time to time may chance to be. . 

Wagner, 
Alas, if one is banished to his study, 
And scarce on holidays the world may see, 
Scarce through a glass, from distant station, 
How can one think to guide it by persuasion ? 

Faust, 
What is not felt, cannot be gained thro' seeking, 
Save from your soul the charm begins 
And, with all-powerful relish speaking, 
The heart of every hearer wins. 
Sit at it always ! Glueing, pasting, 
From feasts of others make a stew. 
And from your heap of ashes, wasting, 
The wretched flames in vain renew ! 
Of children, apes, the admiration, 
If that your palate craves and seeks.

You 41 draw not heart to heart* save inspiration 
From out your own heart breathes and speaks. 

Wagner, 

Delivery only doth success impart 

To speakers ; well I know I lack the art. 

Faust, 
Seek you the honest recompense ! 
Be not a fool of tinkling sound ! 
For reason and good, common sense 
With little art themselves propound ; 
And if thou' St aught to say in earnest, 
Why to vain search for words returnest ? 
Yea, all your speeches, that with glitter please, 
In which for men but paper-shreds you *re curling, 
Are unrefreshing as the foggy breeze 
Which, in the autumn, sets the dry leaves whirling. 

Wagner. 
Ah, God ! So long is art. 
And life so quickly speeding. 
How often, while my critic-studies heeding, 
Have I not feared for head and heart. 
How hard to gain the means, which scholars cherish, 
By which the sources one attains ! 
And ere one yet one-half the journey gains. 
Must a poor devil often perish. 

Faust, 
Is parchment, then, the sacred fount of learning. 
A. drink from which forever slakes the thirst ? 
Vain, for refreshment, is thy yearning. 
If from thy very soul it springs not first. 

Wagner, 
Forgive ! It is a noble pleasure 
The spirit of the ages thus to measure. 
To see, how long before us some wise man has thought. 
And to what glorious end his life-work we have brought.

Faust, 
Oh yes ! Up to the stars on high ! 
My friend, the ages now so long gone by 
A volume are with seven seals protected. 
What *' Spirit of the Age" you call, 
Is really your own spirit, after all, 
In which the ages are reflected. 
The subject is most uninviting ! 
One needs but look, and frightened runs away. 
A dust bin, lumber hole disgust exciting. 
And at the best, a silly puppet play, 
With maxims sage, and axioms pedantic. 
Such as sound well in mouth of puppet's antic ! 

Wagner, 
But then, the world ! Man's heart and brain, in fine ! 
We long to know of them, though e'er so slightly. 

Faust, 
Yes, knowledge, or what we define 
As such ! Who dares to name the infant rightly ? 
The few who knew aught of it, good and sage, 
Whose hearts disdained, unwisely, all concealing. 
And to the mob revealed their insight and each feeling, 
Were crucified and burned in every age. â€” 
The night is far advanced; I beg you, friend, 
Our meeting now must be adjourned. 

Wagner, 
Most gladly would I through the night attend. 
And thus prolong our conversation learned. 
But on the morrow, first of Easter-season, 
By favor on some theme I '11 reason! 
My studies I 've pursued with zeal and ardor glowing; 
True, I know much, but would know all worth knowing. 

Faust, {alone.) ^ '^ 

How hope still lingers in that brain benighted. 
Which always doth in stupid trash delight. 
For treasures digs with greedy might, 
And, finding earthworms, thinks his toil requited.

And may such, human voice here dare to breathe, 
Where spirit-fullness held its sway, bewildering ? 
But ah, for this once I bequeath 
To thee my thanks, thou poorest of Earth's children. 
Thou 'st wrested me from that despairing state. 
To fell destruction every sense decreeing. 
Alas, the vision was so giant-great, 
That to a dwarf I shrunk in all my being. 

I, likeness of the Godhead, who did rise 

So near, in fancy, unto truth eternal. 

Whose being soared to clearness all supernal. 

Divested of this earthly guise; 

I, more than Cherub, whose free power did scheme 

Through nature's veins in bold imagination 

To flow; â€” creating, joyed in God-like station, 

How shall I now endure my expiation! 

A thunderword has shattered every dream. 

With thee I dare not venture to compare me ! 

Though I possessed the power to draw thee near me. 

To hold thee fast I lacked the power supreme. 

In that blessed hour of joyful vision, 

I felt so great, and yet so small; 

Thou 'st thrust me back with cold derision 

Into the doubtful lot of all. 

What must I shun? Who '11 be my teacher? 

Shall I obey that impulse past? 

Alas ! The acts like to the woes of every creature, 

Will clog his life unto the last. 

Unto the Noblest, which the Mind doth master, 

A foreign substance close and closer cleaves ; 

When this world's Good we 've gained, all that is vaster 

And better, man a cheat believes. 

Those glorious feelings, to the soul life giving, 

Grow torpid 'midst the tumult of our living.

Though Phantasy erewhile in daring flight 

And hopeful, to the infinite expanded, 

Yet now she is content with lesser height. 

Since time's mad whirl has every fortune stranded. 

Within the heart care builds her nest, intruding, 

And over secret pains there brooding 

She rocks uneasily, disturbing joy and rest ; 

She hides her face, with new masks ever drest. 

As house or home, as wife or child thy life assailing. 

As fire, flood, poison, steel appears ; 

Though nothing strikes, it wakes thy fears. 

And what thou 'st never lost, thou art fore'er bewailing. 

I am not like the Gods ! Too deep I feel this thrust ; 
I 'm like the worm, that grovels in the dust, 
Which, as it seeks for food the earthy bed. 
Is crushed and buried 'neath the wanderer's tread. 

Is it not dust, all dust ? This lofty wall. 

These hundred shelves, so narrow seeming, 

This trumpery, these thousand trifles, all 

That cramps me in this moth-world, dreaming ? 

And shall I find help here alone ? 

Shall read perhaps, a thousand books o'erturning, 

That to self-torture man is ever prone, 

With here and there a happy one sojourning ? â€” 

What sombre tale dost grin me, hollow skull. 

Save that thy brain, like mine, in false delusion 

The joyous day once sought, and in the twilight dull, 

Yearning for truth, sank sadly in confusion ? 

Ye instruments, forsooth, ye scoff" at me. 

With cogs and rollers, wheels and catches ; 

I reached the gate, ye were to be the key; 

Though deftly wrought your wards, ye cannot lift the latches. 

Mysterious even at bright noon. 

The veil from nature's face thou canst not sever. 

And what she will not grant a voluntary boon, 

Thou canst not force from her with either screw or lever. 

Ye time-worn implements, by me untouched.

Because my father's, ye stand here unsightly. 

Thou, ancient roll, thou still wilt be besmirched. 

As long as at this desk the smoky lamp wanes nightly. 

Much better had I done to waste my litde store, 

Than burdened with it here to sweat in weary spirit ! 

What you obtained from sires gone before, 

Earn first, then own what you inherit. 

What is not used, weighs on us more and more ; 

That which the hour creates alone has real merit 

But why returns my gaze to yonder spot with yearning ? 
Is yonder little vial a magnet for my sight ? 
Whence comes this lovely clearness, gently burning, 
Like silver moonrays lighting gruesome woods at night ? 

I greet thee, vial, matchless in creation. 

Which I take down with fondest adoration; 

In thee I honor human wit and art. 

Thou essence of all gentie slumber-potions, 

Thou extract of the finest, deadliest lotions. 

Thy favor to thy master now impart. 

I gaze on thee, all pain finds mitigation, 

I grasp thee, lessened is each aspiration, 

The spirit's flood-tide slowly ebbs away. 

On, to the open ocean speed I lightiy. 

The glassy flood before my feet gleams brightiy, 

To newborn shores lures me a newborn day. 

A fiery chariot borne on easy pinions 

Floats near to me ! I long to soar on high 

By untrod' roads through ether's vast dominions, 

To newer spheres of pure activity. 

This lofty life, this ecstasy supernal, â€” 

Canst thou deserve such bliss, thou, erst a worm ? 

Yes, on that sun of earth which shines eternal. 

Turn thou thy back with purpose firm ! 

Dare thou to open wide the awful portals, 

Which every coward soul steals gladly by ! 

Now is the time by deeds to show to mortals,

That manhood's dignity well with the Gods may vie, 

Not to shrink back before that Stygian hollow, 

In which wild fancy feels her self-created woe, 

Tiiat tortuous strait to seek and follow, 

Around whose narrow mouth hell's flames forever blow, 

To venture on this step with gladsome spirit. 

E'en though the soul thereby should Nothingness inherit. 

And now, thou cup, of purest crystal moulded. 

Come from thy case that held thee long enfolded, 

Of which I have not thought for many a year ! 

Thy lustre shone of yore at jovial meeting, 

To sombre guests thou gavest greeting, 

As one unto the other brought thy cheer. 

The artful pictures which on thee appear, 

The drinker's task in rhymes their drift to follow. 

And in one draught to drain the sparkling hollow, â€¢ 

Call up full many a youthful night's career. 

I shall not hand thee now to any neighbor. 

Nor show my wit upon thy figures' skillful labor ; 

A juice which quickly overcomes is here. 

With brownish flood it pours, thy hollow filling. 

Which I prepared, which I chose willing. 

This final drink, the soul with rapture thrilling, 

As lofty festal pledge unto the Morn I bear.

Draws firom my lips the glass, its course arresting ?

Which once around the Tomb rang from the angel-throng, 
A new-pledged covenant manifesting ? 

Chorus of the Women, 
With ointment, and clearest 

Balm, we arrayed Him ; 
Faithful and nearest, 

We tenderly laid Him ; 
Linen and cerement 

Wrapped we around Him, 
Ah, to the tomb we went, 

No more we found Him.

Blessed He, and glorious. 

For whom, victorious.

Ye heavenly sounds, in dust here panting ? 
Ring yon, soft souls among, by ye beguiled !

The thought of yonder spheres doth now appall me, 
Whence rings the tidings* gracious truth ; 
And yet, accustomed to this strain from earliest youth. 
Back unto life e*en now it doth recall me. 
Once, heavenly love descended like a kiss 
Upon me. Sabbath-stillness * round me stealing ; 
With mystic longing fraught the chimes rang, sweetly pealing. 
And oh, a prayer was holy, fervent bliss ; 
An inconceivably sweet yearning 

Drove me through wood and meadows, to and fro, ' 

And under thousand tears, hot, burning, 
I felt a world within me grow. 
This song announced to youth gay sports and recreations.

On high ascended, 
Glory assumed again, 

All sorrows ended ;

Near to creative bliss. 
Ah, midst alloy of earth 

Struggles what native is. 
He left us, yearning. 

Longing for Him in vain ;

Through His grace neareth Him,

With none he dances but with thee :

Freed from ice by spring's quickening kiss ;

Weary old winter, his weakness hiding, 
Withdraws to mountain-glen and abyss. 
From thence he sends, with blast yet keen. 
Impotent showers of sleet and hail, flying 
In streaks over garden and meadow green. 
But the sun likes not the white there lying, 
Everywhere works he culture, formation. 
He'd clothe in colors the whole creation; 
But the flowers have not yet spread, 
So he takes the dressed-up people instead.

Toward the city : a sight amazing !

Out from the hollow, gloomy gate 

The motley crowds throng in numbers great. 

Each one basks in the sun's warm ray. 

They celebrate the Lord's Resurrection to-day, 

For they, themselves, have to glory risen ; 

From the sultry rooms of each lowly dwelling, 

From the bonds of trade which held them in prison, 

From the gables and garrets, life quelling, 

From the streets, contracted and crushing. 

From the churches* venerable night. 

All of them have been brought to light. 

See, how quickly the crowds are rushing, 

Spreading o'er garden and field and park, 

How the stream, in the sunlight blushing. 

Carries full many a merry bark. 

And, nigh to sinking, over-weighted. 

This last boat slowly moves away. 

The far off hill-paths e'en are freighted 

With varied colors of dresses gay. 

The village noise I hear now clearly. 

Here is the people's heaven, really; 

Great, small, contented shout their glee : 

Here am I man, dare it to be. 

Wagner, 
To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, talking, 
Is honorable, and is gain ; 
But I would not be found, alone, here walking. 
Since I hold all that's vulgar in disdain. 
Their fiddling, bowling, noisy revels. 
Are sounds for which I hate yon throng ; 
They rave as if possessed by thousand devils. 
And call it pleasure, call it song.

And all the skirts were flowing.

Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Hurrah! La, La, Hurrah! 

With hips to elbows growing.

I sought to end that bitter death 
The power from God in Heaven grasping. 
The plaudits of the crowd like jeers now seem. 
Oh ! Couldst thou read within my inmost spirit. 
How father and son I deem 
Unworthy, such high fame to merit ! 
My father was an unknown gentleman. 
Who Nature's mystery, its sacred spheres and mission 
In honesty, yet full of queer ambition. 
With captious labor thought to scan ; 
Who, with adepts communicating. 
In his dark kitchen stood apart, 
And countless recipes collating 
Opposing forces mixed with art. 
There then, a lion red, a lover dashing. 
Espoused the lily in the tepid bath, 
And both were chased, with fires around them flashing, 
Through bridal-rooms, now this, now that, their painful path. 
Stood then, with motley tints invested. 
The young queen in the glass revealed : 
Here was the medicine, the patients died and rested. 
And no one asked : Who then was healed ? 
Thus have we spread, worse than the plague, infection 
' Mongst hills and dales of this fair section. 
With physic that from hell was raised. 
To thousands my own self the loathsome poison giving,

They died away, and I am living 

To hear the daring murderers praised. 

Wagner. 
Why should this cause you lamentation I 
Enough for each man, brave and just, 
To wield the art he holds in trust 
With conscientious, prompt determination ! 
When thou thy Â£ither honorest as youth, 
Thou follow* St gladly his tuition. 
Increasest thoii, as man, the stores of Truth, 
Thy son can then aspire to loftier mission. 

Faust. 
Blest he, to whom the hope to soar 
From out this sea of errors still is granted ! 
What one knows not, is wanted all the more, 
And what one knows, is never wanted. 
â€” But do not let us wrong the bliss supreme 
Of such an hour by thoughts of sorrow ! 
Behold, how from the setting sun's last beam 
The vine-grown cots new glory borrow ! 
He sinks, departs ; the day is lived and gone, 
He hastes apace, his light new life instilling. 
Oh, why on wings am I not upward borne, 
To follow him, with rapture thrilling ! 
For aye in evening- light I *d hail 
The quiet world beneath me glowing. 
Each mountain-height on fire, content and still each vale, 
The silver brooks to golden rivers flowing. 
Then would not rise, the God-like course to bar. 
The mountain with its wide abysses yawning ; 
The ocean now, with bays that shine like morning 
Spreads 'fore my wildered eyes afar. 
At last the God has vanished from my vision ; 
But newer power awakes, and might, 
I haste to quaff his light, a draught elysian, 
Before me day, and far behind me night. 
The heavens high above, beneath the waves extending. 
A beauteous dream, while fades the golden sphere !

Ah, to the pinions of the mind, I fear, 

Material wings may never wed them, blending ; 

Yet is the feeling born, to wander 

Upward and onward, in each frame of clay, 

When o*er us, lost in the blue ether yonder, 

The lark sends forth its thrilling lay, 

When over mountains, steep and piny, 

The eagle poises, hovering. 

And over plains and billows briny 

The crane strives home with tired wing. 

Wagner. 
I often had myself fantastic notions. 
But never have I felt the like emotions. 
T is tiresome on green woods and fields to look, 
The bird's wing crave I not in slightest measure. 
How otherwise bears us the mental pleasure 
From page to page, from book to book ! 
Then grow the winter nights so lovely fair, 
A warm and blissful life all limbs pervading, 
And oh ! unroll* st thou e*en an ancient parchment rare, 
All heaven descends to thee that knows no fading. 

FausL 
Of this impulse alone thou stand' st confessed; 
Oh, to attain the other seek thou never ! 
Two souls, alas, dwell here within my breast. 
One from the other always strives to sever ; 
The one, in lusty joy, seeks here its rest. 
To this fair world with all its organs clinging ; 
The other rises from the dust with zest, 
To high ancestral spheres its pathway winging. 
Oh, are there spirits, pure and fair. 
Who float twixt heaven and earth on easy pinions. 
Descend ye then from out the golden air 
And lead me hence to new and strange dominions ! 
Yea, could I but a magic mantle own. 
That would to foreign lands convey me, 
Not for the costliest robes that might array me. 
Would I exchange â€” not for a kingly throne !

Wagner. 
Invoke thou not the well-known throngs, which hold 
Full sway throughout the air, therein o'erflowing, 
Which bring to mortals perils thousandfold, 
From every comer breathing, blowing. 
The North assails thee with its spirit-tooth 
And pointed tongues, sharp, piercing like an arrow ; 
From Morningland they come, dry up thy youth. 
And feed upon thy lungs and marrow ; 
If Noonday sends them from the desert curst. 
Glow upon glow around thy forehead heaping. 
Then brings the West swarms which, refreshing first. 
Drown thee, with floods the fields and forests sweeping. 
They list' with joy, are glad to foster harm. 
Obey with joy, with joy all truth defying ; 
They act as if they came from Heaven, and charm 
And whisper, angel-like, while lying. 
â€” But let us go ! Gray lies the world in night. 
The air is cooled, the mists rise white ! 
At eve one learns the house to prize. â€” 
Why stand'st thou thus and look'st with maz4d eyes ? 
What can so move thee in the twilight's gloaming ?

Perceiv'st thou yon black dog through field and stubble

Wagner. 
It is a poodle who, in manner cunning. 
His master's track desires to trace. 

Faust. 
Dost see how, in wide spiral circles running. 
He bounds around in ever lessening space ? 
And, err I not, a fiery whirlpool streameth 
Upon the pathway in his wake.

Faust, 
(^Entering with the poodle,^ 
I have returned from fields and meadows, 
Which now the shades of night control, 
With sacred tremors it foreshadows 
The waking of our better soul. 
Stilled are the restless thoughts that madden, 
Stilled every wild, unholy deed; 
The love of man now stirs to gladden, 
The love of God stirs now to plead. 

Be quiet, poodle! Cease this running and whining! 
Why dost thou sniff ' round the threshold there ? 
Behind the stove now rest thee, reclining, 
My softest cushion thou shalt share. 
As thou, on the mountainous roads, hast attended 
Us, running and leaping, â€” hast done thy best. 
So in return, by me befriended, 
Be a most welcome, quiet guest. 

Ah, when within the chamber narrow 
The lamp burns friendly on the shelf, 
The heart grows light and free from sorrow, 
Bright grows the heart that knows itself. 
Stern sense once more speaks, cool discerning. 
To Hope again the blossoms cling; 
To life's fair rivers tends our yearning, 
Ah! to our being's very spring. 

Snarl not, poodle! With the sacred tones sounding 

Now in my soul, its depths pervading, 

Accords not this bestial noise, degrading. 

We are used to hear Man with sneers propounding 

What he does not understand. 

While the Good and the Beautiful abounding,

Which often molests, sets him growling: 
Will the dog, likewise, set up his howling ? 

But, alas ! I feel, though most anxious and willing, 

That contentment no longer wells forth, the heart stilling. 

Yet, why has the river so quickly vanished. 

And we lie athirst, to a desert banished ? 

Long have I suffered this probation! 

Yet doth this want lead to higher sources. 

We learn to revere the spiritual forces, 

We long and yearn for revelation. 

Which nowhere glows with a purer intent 

Than here, in the New Testament. 

I 'm urged its sacred lore to study â€” 

With honest purpose the divine 

And holy text once, line for line. 

In my beloved German to embody. 

(^He opens a volume and commences .) 
'Tis writ: In the Beginning was the Word! 
How soon at fault! Who 'II further help accord ? 
Is it the Word ? Can I so highly rate it ? 
Nay, I must otherwise translate it 
If I the spirit's teaching' have divined. 
Tis writ: In the Beginning was the Mind. 
â€” Heed well this first line's proper bearing 
Lest thy o'erhasty pen prove thee too daring! 
Doth Mind create and work from hour to hour ? 
It should read : In th' Beginning was the Power! 
Yet, even while I write this down, a feeling 
That asks still further search comes o'er me stealing. 

The spirit aids ! Advised I now proceed 

And write : In the Beginning was the Deed ! 

If we must share this chamber, hark now 

Poodle, then cease to bark now. 

And cease to bellow ! 

Such a noisy, disturbing fellow 

I will not bear, all peace dispelling. 

I, or you thus belling.

Mephistopheles. 

A part of that fell might 
Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Right 

Faust 
What means this curious riddle's dark disguise? 

Mephistopheles, 
I am the spirit that denies ! 
And jusdy so ; for all created life 
Must perish, for corruption rife ; 
Far better life had no existence. 
Thus sin, as you with wrong persistence 
Still call it, ruin, bad intent 
Are all my proper element. 

Faust 
Thou cairst thyself a part, but com'st a whole to me? 

Mephistopheles, 
The modest truth I speak to thee. 
If man, this little foolish world, can call 
And think himself a whole and all : 
Part of that part am I which once did all unite, 
Part of the darkness which gave birth unto the light, 
The haughty light, which Mother Night defies. 
And her the ancient rank, the space, denies ; 
Yet can it not succeed since, tho' it persevere. 
It must to bodies still adhere. 
It streams from bodies, makes the bodies fair, 
A body can impede its glances. 
And thus, I hope, short are its chances, 
And with the bodies will destruction share. 

Faust, 
I now perceive thy worthy mission! 
Thou canst not lead all to perdition. 
And thus begin' st with something less.

No matter how I did pursue it, 

I did not know how to subdue it 

With floods, storms, earthquakes, fire and brand : 

Calm will remain at last both sea and land! 

And that accurs6d stuff, the bestial, human brood 

Have e*en my wish for harm outwearied! 

How many have I slain and buried! 

Yet always circulates a fresh and newborn blood. 

It drives one mad, this everlasting motion ! 

From atmosphere, from earth, from ocean, 

A thousand germs are born and sown. 

In dry, wet, cold and warm distending! 

Were I not on the flame, as mine, depending, 

I could not call a thing my own. 

Faust 
Thus, at the ever striving, working 
And healing power, that creates. 
The devil-fist is stretched out, lurking. 
In vain, to grasp that which it hates! 
Some other aim seek to discover. 
Of chaos thou the curious son ! 

Mephislopheles, 
Most carefully we'll think it over ; 
About this matter more, anon ! 
But may I now, for this once, quit thee ?

Why thou shouldst ask I cannot see. 
I know thee now, and I permit thee. 
Whene'er thou wilt, to visit me. 
Here is the door, there is the window. 
The chimney, too, affords a start.

Lest I across your threshold should depart :

Faust. 
The pentagram gives thee this pain ? 
Explain then, Son of Hell, this wonder, 
How couldst thou enter, if it can retain ? 
How could a sprite like thee be cheated ? 

Mephistopheles . 
Look well at it! It is not all completed ; 
One of its angles, that which leads outside, 
Is somewhat open, fits not squarely. 

Faust 
Now chance at last has hit it, fairly! 
And thou my prisoner must abide? 
By accident this has succeeded ! 

Mephistopheles. 
The poodle took no heed as gaily he proceeded; 
The case now wears a different face: 
The devil cannot leave the place. 

Faust. 
May not the window cure this evil? 

Mephistopheles. 
It is a law for spectres and each devil: 
The road they came they, too, when leaving, must retrace. 
The first is our own choice, we're bondsmen to the second. 

Faust. 
In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned? 
I find this good! A compact might be made 
Now with you, gentlemen, all safe and binding? 

Mephistopheles. 
What's promised thou shalt have without reminding. 
We take naught from it, nor evade. 
But rash resolve might here betray you. 
And we will speak of this anon; 
For it is time I should be gone: 
Kindly dismiss me now, I pray you!

One single moment but remain with me.

Each hour to us doth hoarsely sing. 

I wake in terror with the early mom 

And well could fall to bitter weeping 

To see the day which, to its close from dawn, 

Has not one granted wish, not one, in keeping ; 

Which e'en the thought of joy or rest 

Contracts with whimsical persistence. 

And each creation from my breast 

Mars with the masks of dull existence. 

And when the silent night wraps earth and sky, 

I lay me on my couch affrighted : 

No slumber waits my weary eye. 

But fearsome dreams and shapes benighted. 

The God who dwells within my soul 

Can move its being's inmost sources, 

Each power he holds and sways in full control. 

But cannot stir the outer forces. 

A burden, thus, existence is to me. 

Death is desired, and Life a misery.

Yet Death has never proved a welcome guest to be.

I could have died in rapt emotion !

Dared not to quaff a dark, brown potion.

There 's ample time to all such thoughts to list.

Faust 
No, no ! The devil is an egotist, 
And never has **for God's sake" striven 
To do what might mankind assist. 
Pronounce thy terms both plain and clear ! 
Such servant in the house brings danger near. 

Mephistopheles, 
I '11 promise w^r^ to serve thine every pleasure, 
Thy beck and call shall not be made in vain : 
Do thou the same in equal measure 
When Yonder we shall meet again. 

Faust 
I little care for yonder doings ; 
Dash only thou this world to ruins, 
The other then its course may fill. 
Out from this earth my every rapture started. 
Upon my woes this sun its rays has darted, 
Can I from them be driven, parted. 
Let happen all that can and will. 
Nor will I list to such vain stories, 
If one hereafter loves, or hates. 
And whether in yon fancied glories 
An Up or Down men separates. 

Mephistopheles. 
In such sense thou mayst boldly dare it. 
Come, make the pact ! Ere many days, I swear it, 
Thou shalt with joy my arts behold. 
What man ne'er saw I will to thee imfold. 

Faust, 
What 's thine to give, poor devil, in creation ? 
Was e'er the human mind in its high aspiration 
Conceived by such as thou, or known? 
Food hast thou which not satiates, thou dost own 
Red gold which, without stay, is prone. 
Quicksilver-like, within thine hand to melt; 
A game, in which no trumps are dealt; 
A maiden, who upon my breast

With wanton art looks to my neighbor, leering; 
Bright honor's joy, the Gods' bequest, 
Though like a meteor disappearing : â€” 
Show me the fruit which, ere 't is plucked, will rot, 
And trees which daily fresh, green leaves will offer! 

Mephistopheles, 
Such a demand affrights me not, 
Such treasures easily can I proffer. 
But, good my friend, the time comes on apace. 
When we would feast in peace and rest from action. 

Faust 
If e'er I seek an idler's couch with satisfaction. 
Then ended be my earthly race ! 
Canst thou with lying flattery sway me 
Till, self-pleased, I can view the Past, 
Canst thou with pleasures e'er betray me. 
That be my final day, the last ! 
This bet I offer ! 

Mephistopheles, 
Done ! 

Faust 

And I agree! 
Should I accost the Moment ever : 
Delay a while ! Thou art so fair ! 
Then fetter me, all ties then sever. 
Then ruin be my welcome share ! 
Then may the death-knell sound, appalling. 
Then art thou from thy service free. 
The clock may stop, its pointer falling, 
All time be over then for me! 

Mephistopheles, 
Think first! We hold this not as idle chatter ! 

Faust 
Such is thy full and proper right. 
I spoke not wantonly, my pride to flatter; 
I am a slave my will despite : 
Thine, or another's, does not matter.

MephisiopheUs, 
To-day, then, at the doctor's feast, command 
Thy servant, with our pact complying. â€” 
But hold! â€” In case of living or of dying, 
A line or two I would demand. 

Faust 
Some document, too, pedant, wouldst thou own ? 
Hast never thou a man, or word of man, yet known ? 
Is 't not enough that my outspoken word 
Fore'er shall hold my days in subjugation ? 
Sweeps not the world on, with its currents stirred, 
And shall a pledge bind me at thy dictation ? 
Yet this delusion sways our very heart; 
Who would from it be disunited ? 
Blest, who within him holds pure Truth apart. 
He '11 rue no act to which he *s plighted! 
But then, a parchment stamped and writ with cunning art, 
A spectre is from which all turn affrighted. 
The words within the pen expire, 
And wax and leather Might acquire. 
What wouldst thou have, base imp of Hell ? 
Bronze, marble, parchment, paper â€” tell ? 
Shall it with graver, style, or pen be stated ? 
Thy choice, is free regarding each. 

Mephistopheles, 
Why thus exaggerate thy speech, 
And why so quickly irritated ? 
Some little sheet is all I claim. 
And with a drop of blood thou need'st but sign thy name. 

Faust 
If this contents thy every aim, 
Then be the farce thus terminated. 

Mephistopheles, 
Blood is a juice most rare and fine. 

Faust, 
The pact is made â€” ^fear not that I revoke it! 
The striving of each power of mine

Is just the promise as I spoke it. 
Too high I stretched my daring hand ; 
I can but own such rank as thou : 
The mighty spirit spurned me, and 
Closed are proud Nature's portals now. 
Tom is the thread of inspiration, 
All knowledge I hold in detestation. 
Deep in the raptures of sensual lust 
Quench we the passions so fervidly glowing! 
And Magic's barriers overthrowing. 
Each marvel yield its long-kept trust ! 
Plunge we in time's rushing tide, into life, 
In action's turmoil and its strife ! 
There then may delight and pain, 
Success and disdain, 
Follow each other as best they can : 
Ceaseless action alone proves the man. 

Mepkistopheles, 
Nor bounds are set for you, nor end. 
Would you taste everywhere, or rather 
In passing by aught pleasing gather ? 
May it all well agree, my friend. 
Only fall to, and show no bashful shrinking. 

Faust 
But listen ! Not of pleasures was I thinking. 
I seek the giddy whirl, joys bred from deepest pain, 
Hate sprung from love, refreshing, cool disdain ; 
My breast, no more with stress for knowledge riven, 
Shall not henceforth be closed to any sorrow â€” 
And what to all Humanity is given. 
Or weal, or woe â€” my inmost self shall borrow. 
I '11 grasp the highest, lowest, with my spirit. 
Its bliss, its anguish shall my breast inherit â€” 
Thus shall my own self rise, to Mankind's self expanded. 
And, like it, at the last be wrecked and stranded. 

Mephistopheles, 
Believe me, who for many thousand ages 
Chewed this tough food, which I detest.

From birth to grave none, fools or sages, 
The well-known ancient leaven can digest ! 
Trust such as we ; this whole creation 
Is made but for a God alone ; 
In endless splendor He finds exaltation, 
* Midst ever-lasting darkness we atone, 
And you both day and night must own. 

Faust 
But then, I will ! 

Mephistopheles, 
'T is bravely spoken ! 
But still I fear one little thing. 
For Art is long and Time takes wing. 
The need of aid your words betoken. 
Join yourself to a poet, and ask him 
To give rein to his fanciful vision. 
Seizing each noble trait, and then task him 
To place them at your disposition : 
The lion's fearless mood. 
The stag's swift flight. 
The Italian's fiery blood, 
The North's stern might. 
Let him the secret find, in reason, 
How Nobleness be combined with Treason, 
How, with each youthful pulse impassioned, 
Love may be planned, devised, and fashioned. 
I 'd like to know such a man and proclaim him, 
"Sir Microcosm " would I name him. 

FausL 
What am I then, if vainly seeks my heart 
To gather mankind's crowning treasure, 
To which all senses crowd with eager pressure ? 

Mephistopheles, 
Thou art at last but â€” what thou art. 
Place wigs upon thy head a million curls not lacking, 
Place every foot into a yard-long stocking, 
Thou still remainest what thou art.

Faust 
Vain are the treasures which I hold, disclosing 
The human mind and thought ; I feel this well. 
And if I should sit down at last, reposing, 
Within me no new force can live or dwell ; 
I am not by a hair's breadth higher. 
Nor to the Infinite aught nigher. 

Mephistopheles, 
Good Sir, you view these things as closely 
As every one doth view these things ; 
We must act wiser, less morosely. 
Before the joy of life takes wings. 
Come ! Hands and feet and such, â€” Perdition ! 
And head and . . . . , they all are thine ! 
But what I relish in addition, 
Is it therefore not also mine ? 
If I six stallions can afford. 
Are not their forces mine, full plenty ? 
I speed along and am as grand a lord 
As if I owned legs four-and-twenty. 
Then forward ! Cease to muse and fret ! 
Out in the world, without regret ! 
A speculative fellow is, I say. 
Like to a beast upon dry heather. 
Led by an evil sprite in circling rounds astray, 
While all about green pastures lie together. 

Fatist, 
But how will we begin ? 

Mephistopheles, 

Why, we depart from this. 

Such martyrdom thou wilt not miss ! 

What can one call such life, such being, 

To you and youths ennui decreeing ? 

Sir Neighbor Paunch can do this, too! 

Why plague thyself, and thresh the straw thus vainly ? 

The best that thou canst know or do, 

Thou dar*st not tell the youngsters plainly. 

There's one without â€” his steps are nearing!

Impossible to see him now. 

Mephistopheles, 
The poor boy long has sought a hearing, 
He shall not leave with clouded brow. 
Come, gown and cap lend, to disguise me; 
A charming fit this mask, I vow ! 

{He changes his dress.) 
My wits for such sport will suffice me! 
A quarter of an hour is all I need; 
Meanwhile prepare thyself for our fair trip with speed. 

{Exit Faust.) 

Mephistopheles, 

{In Fatisfs long gown,) 
Despise thou Reason, and calm Science ban, 
The highest power vouchsafed to Man ! 
With sorcery, spells and black delusion. 
Let Satan strengthen thy confusion, 
And then I have thee, without doubt. â€” 
On him, through fate, a spirit has descended 
Which presses onward, unrestrained, throughout, 
Whose impulse, with mad longings blended. 
The joys of Earth doth spurn and scout. 
Through wildest life, till life is ended, 
I *11 drag him, with stale dullness curst; 
Struggling, outwearied, unbefriended; 
And 'midst his hot, insatiate thirst. 
With food and drink before his lips suspended, 
He shall in vain for cool refreshment cry; 
For, even had he not grasped Satan's aid extended, 

Still must he in perdition die.

Mephistopheles, 
Your courtesy rejoices me ! 
A man like many another you see. 
Have you elsewhere acquaintance made ? 

Student 
I pray you, give me kindly aid! 
Good faith I bring, a joyous mood. 
Sufficient money, and healthy blood; 
My mother was loath to bear this separation; 
Yet would I learn here some seemly vocation. 

Mephistopheles, 
Then have you found the genuine mart. 

Student 
Honestly, I would rather depart. 
Within these walls, these halls so dreary, 
I feel quite ill at ease and weary. 
The space is too confined for me. 
One sees naught blooming, not a tree. 
And when to lectures I betake me. 
Thoughts, hearing, seeing, all forsake me. 

Mephistopheles, 
All this is habit, as you 'U see. 
Thus doth a child the mother's breast 
Often refuse, most stubbornly, 
But soon it nurses there with zest. 
Thus will you seek the breasts of learning 
With daily ever-growing yearning. 

Student, 
Upon its neck I *11 hang, my joy confessing ; 
But only say, how can I reach this blessing? 

Mephistopheles, 
Explain, ere further you proceed, 
What faculty best suits your need ? 

Student, 
To be quite learned is my ambition, 
To grasp with perfect recognition 
All knowledge, both of Earth and Heaven, 
Of Science and of Nature, too.

â€¢ Mephistopheles, 
Upon the right track then are you. 
But let your mind to naught else be given. 

Student, 
With soul and body I agree ; 
Yet nathless, Tve some inclination 
For holidays and liberty, 
When summer comes and its vacation. 
Mephistopheles, 
Time quickly flies, therefore do not abuse it, 
Though order teaches how to use it. 
Hence, my dear friend, I would reply 
That you collegium logicum try. 
There will your mind be drilled and braced. 
In Spanish boots both strapped and laced. 
That it henceforth, more wary made, 
Along the path of thought may wade. 
Instead now here, now there, to throw 
Its will-o'-the-wisp light to and fro. 
Then are you taught for many a day 
That, what at one blow you alway 
Accomplished, like eating and drinking, free, 
One, two, three, thereto needed be. 
This fabric of thought resembles in kind 
A weaver's piece wrought by a master-mind. 
Where one treadle thousands of threads entwines, 
With shuttles hither and thither plying. 
With threads invisibly onward flying, 
And one stroke thousand changes combines : 
Then the philosopher steps forth 
And proves that all this has its worth; 
The first was so, the second so, 
Hence must the third and fourth be so. 
And were the first and second not. 
The third and fourth could ne'er be got. 
The scholars everywhere praise this and ponder. 
But none become weavers â€” and no wonder! 
Who would know aught living and describe its merit.

Seeks first to drive out its soul and its spirit, 
And holds then the particles in his hand, 
Lacks nothing but the spiritual band. 
Chemistry '' Encheiresin naturcB^' this names, 
Nor knows how she scorns herself thus and shames. 

Student, 
I do not understand you clearly. 

Mepkistopheles, 
You '11 soon improve, when you more nearly 
Shall view and probe each production, 
And learn to classify its construction. 

Student, 
I feel as stupid from all this, and dull 
As if a mill-wheel turned * round in my skull. 

Mepkistopheles, 
Then would I offer this suggestion : 
Attack Metaphysics, without a question! 
See that you thoughtfully unfold 
That which no human brain can hold; 
And what goes in, and what does not. 
For each a splendid word you *ve got. 
But now, this first half-year, commence 
With order and with diligence. 
Five hours for lessons every day. 
And when the clock strikes â€” ^no delay! 
Be well prepared on every hand,

So you may later see quite plain 
That he said only what the books contain; 
Yet write with zeal all unabated 
As if the Holy Ghost dictated ! 

Student. 
This will not need a second mention ! 
I comprehend its worth aright; 
For what one owns in black and white 
One can take home with pleased intention.

But come now, choose a faculty!

Student. 
For Jurisprudence, then, I feel no inclination. 

Mephisiopheles. 
I blame you not for this determination; 
I know the science, know it thoroughly. 
Rights are transferred and legislation 
Like to a plague none can efface; 
From generation dragged to generation, 
And slowly moved from place to place. 
Sense grows to nonsense, spite good-will displaces; 
Woe, since thou art a grandchild, woe! 
The right that was born with us, though. 
Of that, alas, one finds no traces! 

Student, 
My loathing is increased anew. 
Oh, happy who is taught by you ! 
Theology I would now almost mention. 

Mephistopheies, 
To lead you wrong I can have no intention. 
Regarding now this science, why 
*Tis hard to shun the wrong path in this matter; 
So many hidden poisons in it lie. 
So like the medicine, one scarce can tell the latter. 
Here also is it best to listen but to one. 
Swear by the master's words, or none. 
In short, by words alone abide you ! 
Through guarded portals will they guide you 
Into the shrine of Certainty. 

Stude7it. 
Yet in the word there must a meaning be. 

Mephistopheies, 
All well; but there's no need to be too much dejected! 
For when no sense can be detected. 
Then comes the word and steps in properly. 
With words disputing is a pleasure. 
With words a system 's made, at leisure. 
In words one can believe most truly. 
From words cannot a jot be stolen duly.

Stzident. 
Pray, pardon; I annoy you with such questions, 
But I would ask you to begin 
And give me now of Medicine 
A few brave words, or some suggestions. 
Three years will quickly onward glide, 
And, Lord! The field is very wide. 
If but a hint one has received 
'Twere easier far to reach one's level. 

MephistopheleSy (aside.) 
Of this dry tone I 41 be relieved, 
And once again must^play the devil. 

(Aloud,) 
The sense of Medicine with ease one guesses ; 
You study great and smaller worlds and plod. 
Though at the last it all progresses 
As pleaseth God. 

In vain that you should seek vast Science to enfold. 
For each one learns but that which learn he can ; 
Who grasps the moment, firm and bold, 
He is the proper man. 
You are of pleasing mien, well grown. 
With courage, too, you '11 form alliance. 
Rely upon yourself alone. 
And others place in you reliance. 
On women most bestow your observation ; 
Their everlasting ahs ! and ohs ! 
Of thousand woes 
Are cured by one sure application ; 
If you but act discreetly, that 
Will place them all beneath your hat. 
A title must assure them first, thus proving 
That your art leads all others of its kind; 
Then, for a welcome, touch and grope, o'er beauties roving, 
Which takes another many years to find; 
Count, too, the pulse, whene' er it chances. 
And press your arms with fiery, knowing glances 
Around her slim waist, bold and free, 
To see how tightly laced she be.

Give us a song! 

Mephistopheles, 
If you desire it, many. 
SiebeL 
A brand-new piece, though, I demand. 
Mephistopheles. 
We have returned but now from Spain, the land 
Of Wine and Song, more beautiful than any. 

{Sings.) 
A king there was in story 

Who owned a giant flea 

JFrosch. 
Hark ye ! A flea! Have you well understood ? 
A flea 's a guest of noble blood! 

Mephistopheles y {Sings.) 
A king there was in story. 
Who owned a giant flea. 
He loved him and did glory 
As if his son were he. 
A tailor he called for his treasure. 
The tailor came in haste: 
** There, clothes for the squire measure. 
And make him pants with taste ! * *

Brander, 
But mind and tell the tailor not to soil them, 
To measure fully every thread, 
And that he, as he loves his head, 
Sees that no single crease shall spoil them! 
Mephistopheles. 

In silks and velvets gaily 

He had his favorite dressed. 

With ribbons he decked him daily. 

Placed a cross upon his breast. 

A minister soon in station, 

A star he now could sport. 

Then every friend and relation 

Became a great lord at court. 

The lords and ladies were bitten 
And plagued at home and at court. 
The queen and her maid were smitten, 
And stung and sorely hurt; 
Yet did not dare to snap them 
Nor frighten them away : 
We strangle, snap and slap them, 
Whenever we find them astray ! 

Chorus y {Shouting,) 
We strangle, snap and slap them, 
Whenever we find them astray! 
Frosch. 
Bravo! Bravo! That was good! 

SiedeL 
This be the fate of all such brood! 

Brander. 
Point the fingers and grasp them, in fine! 

Altmayer, 
Hurrah for freedom! Hurrah for wine! 

Mephistopheles. 
To honor freedom I would drink and join the chorus. 
If somewhat better wines you could but set before us.

WITCHES' KITCHEN. 



( Upon a low hearth stands a large caldron over the fire. In 
the fumes which arise from it, different forms show them- 
selves. A female monkey sits near the caldron, skims it, arid 
takes care that it does not boil over. The male monkey with 
the young ones sits close by, and warms himself. The walls 
and ceiling are ornamented with the most uncouth articles of 
witch-furniture. ) 

Faust and Mephistopheles. 
Faust. 
This crazy witchcraft fills me with aversion; 
I shall be healed, is thy assertion, 
Through such a chaos, raving mad? 
Am I to ask an old hag for assistance ? 
And will her cookery, foul and bad, 
Take thirty years from my existence? 
Woe *s me, if naught else thou hast found I 
Already all my hopes are blighted. 
Has neither nature, nor a mind profound. 
Upon some rare and potent balsam lighted ? 

Mephistopheles, 
My friend, thy speech is wise once more ! 
There is a natural way to give thee back youth's forces; 
But in another book is writ that lore, 
A chapter full of queer resources. 

Faust. 
I wish to know it. 

Mephistopheles. 
Good ! No money wilt thou need. 
Nor leech nor witchcraft for thy healing! 
At once go to the field and weed. 
With hoe and spade new strength revealing; 
Keep thou thyself and all thy sense 
Within a very narrow paling,

With coarse and simple food thyself regaling, 

Live as a beast with beasts, nor think 't will thee degrade, 

To dung the land from which thy food is taken ; 

The best law this, if well obeyed. 

To keep thy youth for eighty years unshaken. 

FausL 
I am not used to it, nor could, without misgiving, 
Take spade in hand to earn my living. 
The narrow life suits not at all my case. 

Mephistopheles, 
Then, after all, we'll have the witch to face. 

FausL 
But wherefore that old woman, pray ? 
Canst thou not help, the potion brewing ? 

Mephistopheles, 
That were a pastime, I must say! 
I could build thousand bridges, whilst so doing. 
Not art alone, or science, share 
In this work â€” patience, too, and care. 
A quiet mind toils on for years; time lengthens, 
And thus the subtle fermentation strengthens. 
And everything that *s in it wrought. 
Is strange; with naught I can compare it! 
The devil the secret of it taught, 
But yet the devil can't prepare it. 

i^He perceives the animals,^ 
Look here! Behold the tender pair! 
This is the maid! The man is there! 

{To the animals,^ 
It seems the dame from home has ridden ? 
The monkeys. 
To a feast she 's bidden, 
Out in the air 

Through the chimney there!

TJu monkeys.

How happy would the ape be, how contented. 
If lottery but his luck augmented!

bally which they now bring forward,) 
The male monkey. 
This is the world.

Soon breaks, alas! 
There 's naught within it. 
Here bright it beams. 
Here brighter gleams.

Why, if a God doth work six days with all his strength. 
And * * bravo * * says himself at length, 
Then it must have a clever ending. 
For this once stand and gaze thy fill ; 
A sweetheart like her I will yet discover.

Who bears her to his home, her lover!

For truly, since we last met face to face 
Full many a day has come and vanished. 
And Culture, too, which licks the world all o'er. 
Attacks the devil more and more. 

The northern phantom's might no longer doth prevail now; 
Where seest thou horns and claws and tail now ? 
And as regards the foot, which I can't do without.

Therefore I have assumed like many a youth, no doubt, 
False calves for many years to hide it.

Much time I spent upon it â€” vain endeavor! 
For perfect contradiction is 
Unto the wise and fools a mystery forever. 
The art is old and new, you see. 
In every age the custom flourished 
That three and one, and one and three

Leave me in peace with your law forever. 
And this I tell you, short and good: 
Unless the sweet and winsome blood 
Rests in my arms to-night, subdued. 
Our pact at midnight I shall sever.

To search for suitable occasions.

But, pray you, show no needless worry: 
What boots it, pleasures thus to hurry ?

As many Italian tales will tell.

Full many a pleasant spot I know. 
And treasures buried long ago; 
I must their secret haunts uncover.

EVENING. 



A small, clean chamber, 
Margaret, 
(^Plaiting and binding up her hair,) 
I 'd give a deal could I but say 
Who was that gentleman to-day! 
So good and honest was his face, 
He must have come of noble race; 
I could read that in every feature â€” 
Else had he not been such a saucy creature. 

(^Exit) 
Mephistopheles, Faust, 
Mephistopheles, 
Come in, but softly; come, I say! 

Faust y {after a few moments of silence,) 
Leave me alone awhile, I pray. 

Mephistopheles y {prying about, ) 
Few girls keep things so clean alway. 

{Exit,) 
Faust i {looking around him,) 
Hail, twilight sweet, whose dusky ray 
This peaceful fane but half reveals. 
Pierce thou my heart, sweet pain of love, to-day, 
Tl^pu, which with dew of hope its longing heals. 
How breathes around a silence holy! 
What order, what content is this! 
What wealth, with poverty so lowly ! 
Within this dungeon's dim retreat, what bliss! 

{He throws himself into the leather arm-chair which stands 
beside the bed,) 
Receive me, thou, who hast in time of yore 
Stretched out to joy and pain thine arms in blessing! 
How oft, alas, this father-throne before.

Has paused a merry crowd, their shouts repressing! 

Perchance, while grateful for the Christchild's gift, 

My darling here, with childlike cheeks, caressing. 

Has touched her sirens thin hand with kisses swift. 

I feel, oh maid, thy spirit rare 

Of peace and order round me breathing. 

Which daily teaches thee with mother-care; 

Which on the table spreads the cloth so clean and fair. 

And at thy feet the sand, in crinkles wreathing. 

Oh dearest hand ! So Godlike thou! 

The cot, through thee, a heaven becomes e'en now! 

And here! 

{^He lifts up the bed curtain,^ 
What shuddering joys each pulse elate! 
Here could I tarry hours in waiting. 
Here Nature, in mild, happy dreams creating, 
Did form an angel incarnate. 
Here lay the child, with warm life glowing 
The tender breast, a sacred shrijie, 
And here, more pure and holy growing. 
Developed into form divine ! 

And thou ? What brought thee hither, say ? 

How all these thoughts my bosom sway! 

What wouldst thou here? Why grows thine heart so sore? 

Poor wretched Faust! I do not know thee more. 

A magic spell doth me ensnare ? 

I thought to please a passing notion, 

And sink, instead, in dreams of fond devotion ! 

Are we the plaything of each breath of air ? 

And should this moment she before thee rise. 
How would thy crime steep thee in dire confusion! 
The giant â€” ah, how dwarfed in size! â€” 
Would at her feet seek absolution. 

Mephistopheles, 
Be quick! I hear her step approaching. 

Faust, 
Hence! Hence! I *11 nevermore return!

Mephistopheles. 
Here is a casket she wont spurn, 
Which I obtained elsewhere encroaching. 
Just place it in the cupboard there. 
I swear, she'll lose her head with pleasure ; 
Trinkets are in it, I declare, 
That would gain any maiden's treasure. 
Though child is child, and play is play! 

Faust. 
I know not, shall I ? 

Mephistopheles. 
What? Delay? 
Mean you to hoard the gems? Speak plainly! 
In that case I your lust inveigh 
To save itself the precious day, 
And me the task to labor vainly. 
You are no churl, I hope and pray! 

I scratch my head and rub my fingers 

{He places the casket in the cupboard and closes the lock.) 

Come now ! Away ! 

That naught within the child so gay 

Contrary to your heart's wish lingers, â€” 

While you look, for all. 

As though asked to go to the lecture hall. 

As if grey, living, there appeared to you 

Physics, and Metaphysics too! 

Come, hence! {Exeunt.) 

Margaret y (with a lamp.') 
It is so sultry here, and hot â€” 

{She opens the window.) 
And yet outside 'tis not so warm. 
I feel I know not how, nor what â€” 
I wish that mother would come home. 
From head to foot runs over me a chill â€” 
I'm but a silly maiden still! 

{She begins to singy while undressing.) 
Once was a king in Thule, 
Was true till to the grave. 
To whom his mistress dying, 
A golden goblet gave.

It was his greatest treasure, 
He drained it every bout, 
His eyes brimmed fullest measure 
Whene'er he drank thereout. 

And when he came near dying, 
The towns of the Realm he told. 
Naught to his heir denying 
Except the goblet of gold. 

At the kingly feast and wassail 
Amongst his knights sat he, 
In his grand, ancestral castle. 
Yon castle by the sea. 

There stood the old carouser, 
And drank the last life-glow, 
And hurled the sacred goblet 
Into the flood below. 

He saw it falling, drinking, 
And sinking in the sea â€” 
His eyelids then were sinking. 
And never a drop drank he. 

(^She opens the cupboard to put away her clothes, and per- 
ceives the jewel box,) 
Whence comes this lovely casket that I see ? 
I locked the press most certainly. 
'Tis wonderful indeed! What can within it be? 
Perhaps some one has pawned the thing 
To mother, who made some advance ? 
Here hangs the key upon a string; 
I think I will give just one glance! â€” 
What's this? Good Heaven! What a sight! 
In all my days I ne'er saw such display! 
Such jewels! Why, a noble lady might 
Wear them on highest holiday. 
How would the chain fit, anyway? 
Who may those splendors own, so many?

The earrings I crave most, if any ! 

One looks at once quite different so. 

What use is beauty now, or youth ? 

'T is very well and good, forsooth, 

But it is all we have to show; 

Half scorning, they praise our features. 

Toward gold tend. 

On gold depend 

All things. Ah, we poor creatures!

PROMENADE. 

{Faust, walking thoughtfully to and fro. To him Mephis- 
topheles,) 

Mephistopheles, 
By every rejected passion! By Hell's fire, I cannot bear it I 
I wish I knew something worse, so that I might swear it! 

Faust, 
What now ? What gripes thee thus anew ? 
In all my life I never saw such features! . 

Mephistop}\eles, 
I *d yield me to the devil or his creatures. 
If I were not a devil too! 

Faust, 
Has aught within thy brain played treason ? 
It suits thee well, to seem bereft of reason. 

Mephistopheles, 
But think, the gems which we to Margaret gave, 
A priest has snatched away, the knave! â€” 
The mother haps to spy the bauble, 
At once grows frightened, augurs trouble: 
That woman has such very fine scent. 
Sniffs through her prayer-book any event. 
And scents each matter, rich or plain, 
Whether the thing be holy or profane; 
As to the gems, of course, she found 
That not much grace in them was bound. 
**My child,** cried she, ** unrighteous good 
Ensnares the soul and poisons the blood. 
To the Virgin give it, she will hear us. 
With heavenly manna she may cheer us! ** 
But Margaret made a face at this; 
**A gift horse,'* she thought, ** in truth it is, 
And verily, godless cannot be he 
Who brought it here so cunningly.**

The mother then a parson invited, 
Who heard the joke to him recited, 
And, cunningly his joy repressing. 
Spoke thus : ** 'T is proper so, and right! 
Who overcometh, wins the fight. 
The Church, a healthy stomach possessing, 
Has swallowed many lands as forfeit. 
And never yet complained of surfeit; 
The Church alone, ladies, without a question. 
Has for ill-gotten gains digestion." 

Faust, 
This is a very common thing, 
It can be done by Jew or King. 

Mephistopheles, 
Then off he swept chain, armlet, rings. 
As if they were but worthless things. 
And thanked them neither less nor more 
Than if a sack of nuts he bore, 
Promised them heavenly reward and rest â€” 
And they were much edified and blest. 

Fatist 
And Margaret? 

Mephistopheles, 
111 at ease she grows. 
Nor what she would, nor should, she knows, 
Thinks of the jewels day and night. 
But most in the giver her thoughts delight. 

Faust, 
The darling's sorrow pains me sore. 
Get her some other gems, and more! 
The first gift was by far too small. 

Mephistopheles, 
Oh yes, 'tis child's-play to your lordship all! 

Faust, 
And work and plan it to my will! 
Keep at her neighbor, court her still ! 
Comet Devil, do not be like pap. 
But scatter new jewels in her lap!

THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. 



Martha^ {alone,) 
God pardon my dear husband, he 
Has not done well at all by me ! 
Straight out into the world he *s flown, 
And leaves me on the straw alone. 
I never caused him sorrow, truly, 
And always, God knows, loved him duly. 

{She weeps.) 
Perhaps he 's dead! â€” Oh cruel fate ! â€” 
Had I but a certificate ! 

{Margaret comes.) 
Margaret 
Dame Martha ! 

Martha. 

What now, Margery ? 
Margaret. 
I scarce can keep my knees from trembling ! 
Within my press, the first resembling, 
I 've found a box of ebony. 
With beautiful jewels in it, more 
And costlier than those before. 

Martha. 
Thou must not tell this to thy mother; 
To the priest she *d bring it, like the other. 

Margaret. 
Oh ! Only look, â€” oh, only see ! 

Martha, {dressing her up.) 
A happy creature thou must be ! 

Margaret. 
But in the streets I dare not show them, 
And e*en at church I must forego them.

Martha, 
Come often thou to me, thy neighbor, 
And wear the jewels here by stealth. 
Walk for an hour before the glass, a pleasant labor, 
We both rejoice in this thy wealth. 
And then, occasions come, a holiday. 
When by degrees one shows the folk the rich array. 
A chainlet first, then the pearls for the ear; 
The mother sees it not â€” we tell a tale â€” no fear! 

Margaret, 
But who could bring both caskets to delight me ? 
These strange, mysterious things affright me. 

{A knock!) 

Margaret, 
Good God, is this my mother, say ? 

Martha^ {^peeping through the curtain,)

Martha,

Pardon the freedom; when you 're at leisure 
This afternoon, I '11 return at your pleasure.

You have such manners, and a glance so proud, â€”

Mephistopkeies. 
Would I had news of better cheer! 
Don't make me smart for *t, I entreat you: 
Your husband's dead, and sends to greet you.

My husband dead! Ah, what a blow!

Dear Dame, come, be consoled by me!

Love's short-lived joy shall ne'er deceive me. 
Nigh unto death such loss would grieve me.

Martha. 
Relate his life's sad close to me! 

Mephistopkeies. 
At Padua lies he buried, resting 
Close to the Church Saint Anthony, ^ 
In consecrated ground and holy. 
He found his last bed, cool and lowly.

Three hundred masses buy, which for his soul be spoken! 
But otherwise an empty purse I wear.

Martlia, 
What! Not a pocket piece! No gem! 
Such as each journeyman keeps in his bag for luck, 
Or for a fond remembrance took, 
And never sells â€” begs, hungers rather? 

Mephistopheles, 
I *m sorry, Madam â€” none of them; 
Yet all his money went not idly, as I gather. 
His errors, too, repented he, I know, 
Yea, and bewailed his fate still more, and all his woe. 

Margaret, 
Ah, that we mortals must such grief endure! 
I will, to rest his soul, full many a prayer offer. 

Mephistopheles, 
You *re worthy that some man should marriage proffer; 
You are a lovely child, I 'm sure. 

Margaret 
Ah no, 't is far too early yet.

If not a husband, then a lover get. 
*Tis of all the greatest heavenly blessing 
Such a dear thing to hold, caressing.

That's not the custom of this land. 

Mephistopheles, 
Custom or not, 'tis in demand. 

Martha, 
But tell me, please! 

Mephistopheles, 
I stood beside his bed when dying â€” 
* T was hardly better than manure. 
Of rotten straw; but still he died a Christian pure; 
He found his last account was far from gratifying.

Martha^ {weeping?) 
The dear, good man ! Long since I have forgiven. 

Mephistopheles, 
** But yet, God knows, the greater guilt bore she! *' 

Martha. 
He lied, then! What, so near the grave, and lying! 

Mephistopheles, 
He surely raved at last when he was dying, 
If I but half know what is what. 
* * I had, * ' said he, * * no time to pass in idle dreaming. 
First babes, then bread for them was all my scheming, 
Bread in its widest sense, at that; 
Yet never could I eat my part without commotion." 

Martha, 
Had he then all my faith forgotten, my devotion, 
The drudgery by day and night ? 

Mephistopheles. 
Nay, he did recollect, as well he might. 
He said: "" When I from Malta went away, 
I prayed for wife and children most devoutly; 
And Heaven proved our friend so stoutly. 
That soon a Turkish ship became our prey. 
Which had on board the Sultan's private treasure; 
And valor now received its meed. 
I also did obtain a goodly measure. 
As was my proper due indeed." 

Martha, 
Ah, how ? Ah, where ? He buried and revealed it ? 

Mephistopheles. 
Who knows where now the four winds have concealed it ? 
A handsome lady took of him good care. 
While he, unknown, in Naples was reposing; 
Of love and truth she gave him such full share. 
That the result he felt till life was closing. 

Martha, 
The rogue! To rob his babes ! To spend it! 
E*en all the misery, all the woe, 
Cured not his loose life, nor could mend it!

Mephistopheles. 
Well, see, for that he had to go. 
In your place now, I tell you plainly, 
I 'd mourn for him one decent year; 
Meanwhile for a new love I *d seek, and not seek vainly. 

Martha, 
Alas, as was my first, I fear. 
In this world I shall find no man as loving! 
There never was a sweeter fool, I think. 
True, he did love to spend his time in roving. 
And foreign lasses and foreign drink. 
And the accursâ‚¬d game of dice. 

Mephistopheles, 
It would be fair and liberal dealing 
Had he o* erlooked your every vice 
On his part with like generous feeling. 
I vow, if you such course pursue, 
I would myself change rings with you.

You *re trifling, Sir, in jesting fashion.

Seek names, but find none, thoughts revealing, 
Then rove throughout the world, each sense impassioned, 
Grasp after words most nobly fashioned. 
And call this glow within me burning 
An endless, never-dying yearning, 
Is this a lying fiend's game still ?

And yet Tm right!

Now hark, I pray â€” 
Take heed, my weary lungs to tire forbearing â€”

And shames me by his condescension. 
A traveller is used, I find, 
To give in kindness his attention; 
I know too well that to such learned guest 
My poor talk cannot be of interest. 

Faust, 
One glance from thee, one word more entertains. 
Than all the lore this world contains.

Don't incommode yourself! How can your lips caress it? 
It is so ugly, coarse in fact! 

What work have I not done! You'd never guess it!

And you, dear Sir, you travel always thus ? 

Mephistopheles. 
Alas, by work and duty are we driven ! 
To leave a place, what pain oft follows us ! 
Yet time to linger is not always given. 

Martha. 
When young in years it may well do 
To rove the world unchecked, in joyous gladness; 
But comes the time, the bad one too. 
When as a bachelor one seeks his grave in sadness, 
From this ne'er came a blessing true.

My brother is a soldier, 

My little sister *s dead. 

True, with the child a dull and weary life I led; 

Yet would I gladly bear all that again, aye, double, 

So dear was she to me. 

Faust. 
An angel if like thee ! 
Margaret 
I brought her up and dearly loved she me. 
Born after father's death, she needed tending. 
For mother then we thought past mending. 
So low as she at that time lay, 

And strength returned to her but slowly, day by day. 
Of course, she could not think, thus ailing. 
To still, herself, the poor worm's wailing, 
And so I raised her all alone 
On milk and water, as my own. 
Within my arms, upon my lap, 
She smiled, kicked, grew, free from mishap. 

Faust, 
The purest rapture hast thou surely tasted. 

Margaret, 
Yet also hours in tiring labor wasted. 
The infant's crib stood during night 
Close to my bed, and stirred the little sleeper, 
I wakened, quite; 

Now must I feed her, now beside me keep her. 
Now, if not silenced, leave the bed 

And dandling walk the floor up, down, with weary tread, 
And at the wash-tub stand at morning-red; 
Then market, cooking still my work increasing. 
To-day, to-morrow, never ceasing. 
One's spirits, Sir, oft are not of the best, 
But then we relish food, we relish rest.

Margaret, 
What shuddering thrill ! 

Faust 
Oh, tremble not! May this fond glance 
Tell thee, â€” this hand-clasp, true and tender. 
What cannot be expressed: 
To wholly yield oneself, and feel a rapture 
Pervading, which must never end ! 
Never! â€” Its ending would be eternal despair. 
No, â€” no ending! No ending!

Mephistopheles, 
Yes, and we will depart. 
Martha. 
rd ask you longer to remain here, 
But this is such a very wicked mart. 
It seems as if no one had naught to gain here, 
Nor do no labor, 

But watch the steps and doings of one* s neighbor. 
And one gets talked about do whatsoe' er one may. 
And our young couple? 

Mephistopheles.

The playful summer birds !

And hers for him. This is the world's old way.

FOREST AND CAVE. 

Faust ^ {alone,) 
Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all 
For which I prayed. Not for a purpose vain 
Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire; 
Thou gav'st me glorious nature as my kingdom. 
And strength to feel, to cherish it. Not only 
Cold, wondering intercourse dost thou allow : 
Thou grantest me within its inmost breast 
To gaze, as in the bosom of a friend. 
Past me lead*st thou the throng of those that live. 
And teachest me to know my brethren, dwelling 
In silent wood, in air, or in the water. 
And howls the storm and hisses through the forest. 
The giant fir tree, crashing, neighbor branches 
And neighbor trunks with crushing might, tears down. 
And to its fall the hill responds in thunder: 
Then to the cave secure thou lead'st me, showest 
My own self unto me, when stand revealed 
The deep, mysterious wonders of my heart. 
And when the pure moon rises to my gaze 
With soothing influence, before me float. 
From rocky walls and from the forest damp. 
The silvery forms of former centuries. 
And temper meditation's fierce delight. 

Oh, that no man a perfect thing can own 
I now perceive! Thou gavest to this rapture, 
Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods, 
The fell companion, whom I now no more 
Can do without, although he, cold and bold. 
Degrades me to myself, and into naught. 
With one breath of his lips, thy gifts transforms. 
He kindles in my breast a furious fire

For that enchanting vision, ne'er at peace. 
Thus from desire I stagger to enjoyment, 
And in enjoyment, languish for desire. 

{Mephistopheles comes,) 

Mepkistopheles, 
Hast thou now had enough of life like this ? 
How canst enjoy it, dull and bitter ? 
To try it once I do not think amiss. 
But then to something newer, fitter! 

Faust, 
I wish you 'd find some other quest. 
Except to plague me here unduly. 

Mepkistopheles, 
Well! Well! I leave thee to thy rest. 
Thou really canst not say this truly. 
The loss were small indeed â€” that's plain! â€” 
Of such a mad, rude, unkind creature. 
All day one's hands are full of work and strain ! 
And what he likes, or don't like, it were vain 
To try to read it in the gent's proud feature. 

Faust, 
Now this is just the proper tone! 
He bores me first, then would my thanks secure. 

Mepkistopheles, 
Without me, poor earth-child, alone. 
How couldst thou such a life endure ? 
Of Fancy's nonsense, thou must own, 
I have in thy case made a perfect cure; 
And were I not, thou wouldst have gone 
And walked off from this earth-ball, sure. 
Why seek in rocky clefts, all joy dispelling, 
In caves, as does the owl, thy dwelling ? 
Why draw from mouldy moss, from dripping rocks' abode 
Thy nourishment, as does the toad ? 
A pastime that may well refresh ! 
The doctor cleaves still to thy flesh.

Fatist 
How couldst thou know what strength of life, what thrills, 
This wandering in the wilderness instills ? 
Yea, couldst thou dream a like emotion, 
Thou wouldst be fiend enough to grudge me my devotion. 

Mephistopheles, 
A heavenly joy, there 's no denying ! 
In night and dew upon the motfntains lying. 
And earth and heaven in rapt delight embracing, 
Unto a Godhead rise, sight most amazing ! 
In yearning stress throughout earth's marrow creeping, 
Upon your breast all the six days' work heaping, 
In haughty strength I know not what enjoying, 
Or in ecstatic love with all creation toying. 
While vanished is each earthly tie, 
And then, to close this intuition high â€” 

( IVtth a gesture, ) 
I dare not say what means employing! 

Faust 
Shame on thee! 

Mephistopheles, 
What, my words art criticising ? 
You have the right to cry ** shame," moralizing ! 
One may not bring to chaste ears* understanding. 
From which chaste hearts refrain not, notwithstanding. 
And in one word, I grudge you not this lying 
To your own selfâ€” a joy most gratifying! 
But long you can't endure this so. 
Already feel'st thou the reaction, 
And, shouldst persist in its protraction, 
'T will end in madness, horror, woe. 
Enough of this ! Yonder thy sweetheart dwelleth. 
Consumed with sad anxiety. 
The thought of thee all else dispelleth: 
She's overmighty fond of thee. 
First came thy mad passion and all inundated. 
As from the melted snow a brooklet rises high; 
Within her heart it penetrated.

And now, again, thy brook is dry. 

Methinks, instead of in forests reigning, 

'T would well become the mighty lord 

The poor, young creature to reward 

For love so true and uncomplaining. 

All time to her grows sadly long ; 

She stands at the window, views the clouds that float 

High over the ancient city-ftioat; 

"Would I were a little bird," so runs her song 

All day, and half the night along. 

Again she is joyful, sad most days, 

Again weeps to extreme, 

Then she is quiet, 'twould seem, 

But in love always. 

Faust 
Serpent ! Serpent ! 

Mephistopheles, (aside.) 
Aye, do I snare thee? 

Faust. 
Hence, Reprobate! Cease thine offenses, 
Nor name her whom my thoughts caress ! 
The wish her sweet, fair body to possess 
Bring not again before my half-crazed senses ! 

Mephistoplieles, 
What wouldst thou then ? She thinks thou *st left her quite, 
And half and half I think she *s right. 

Faust 
I 'm near her e'en when I am furthermost; 
I '11 ne'er forget nor lose her, so endearing; 
Yea, I am envious of the Holy Host, 
When her sweet lips touch it meanwhile, revering. 

Mephistopheles, 
Quite so, my friend ! I envied you, while heeding 
The twinpair under blooming roses feeding. 

Faust, 
Away, thou pimp !

Mephistopheles, 
'Tis well! You chide, I shake with laughter. 
God, who made lads and lasses both, 
Perceived their noblest aim, and nothing loath 
Made Opportunity right after. 
Come now! A great woe hovers o'er you! 
Your sweetheart's room doth ope before you, 
And not the grave, indeed! 

Faust 
What is the heavenly joy her arms can render ? 
E*en on her bosom, warm and tender. 
Do I not always feel her need ? 
Am I not fugitive, homeless, abhorrent 
A monster, without aim or rest. 

Who like a spring- tide sweeps from rock to rock, a torrent, 
On, toward the abyss, with furious zest ? 
And sidewards she, each childlike sense still sleeping. 
Dwells in her cot upon the alpine field, 
And all her homely doings keeping 
Within this little world concealed. 
And I, God's hate around me. 
Had not enough, e'en when 
I grasped the rocks that bound me, 
Dashed them to fragments then! 
Her, and her peace I must give to perdition ! 
This, Hell, â€” this sacrifice was thine ambition ! 
Help, Devil now, nor suffer me to languish! 
What must be, let it quickly be! 
Her fate upon me fall and all its anguish; 
One ruin be our destiny. 

Mephistopheles, 
Again it seethes, again it burns! 
Go in, thou fool, and comfort her! 
When such a head as thine perceives no turns. 
The end of things it doth infer. 
Hail him who keeps his courage bright! 
Thou 'rt otherwise full of all devil's daring. 
I know upon this world no sorrier sight 
Than is a devil, when despairing.

When he is not near. 
The grave is here,

Turned into gall. 

My aching head

My aching brain 
Is torn and mazed. 

My rest is gone, 
My heart is sore; 
I never shall find it. 
No, nevermore! 

For him, him only 
Through the pane I spy. 
For him, him only 
From home I hie. 

His lordly gait. 
His noble size. 
The smile of his lips. 
The charm of his eyes. 

His kindly talk's 
Sweet, magic bliss, 
The clasp of his hand, 
And oh! â€” his kiss!

MARTHA'S GARDEN. 



Margaret, Faust, 

Margaret, 
Promise me, Henry â€” 

Faust, 
What I can! 

Margaret, 
Now say, how dwells religion in thy heart? 
Thou art a good and tender man. 
But I believe, thou hast in that small part. 

Faust, 
Leave this, my child! Thou feel'st, I love thee well; 
For those I love my flesh and blood I 'd sell; 
I rob no one of faith or church, his spirit grieving. 

Margaret, 
T is wrong ! One must accept believing! 

Faust. 
Must one ? 

Margaret, 
Ah, wouldst thou in this matter hear me! 
Thou honorest not the sacraments, I fear me. 

Faust, 
I honor them. 

Margaret, 
But without partaking; 
Thou com'st not to mass or shrift, each duty ever forsaking. 
Dost thou believe in God ? 

Faust, 

My darling, who so daring 
To say, ** I believe in Him ?" 
Ask priest or sage, their creed declaring. 
And their response seems mockery, dim 
In its sense, to the asker. 

Margaret, 

Then thou dost not believe ?

Faust 
Do not, sweet face, my answer misconceive! 
Who dares to name Him, 
Who to proclaim Him, 
Saying : '* I believe in Him? " 
Who own a feeling, 
And dares, concealing 
It, say : ** Him I do not believe ? " 
The AU-Enfolder, 
The All-Upholder, 
Enfolds, upholds He not 
Thee, me. Himself? 
Vaults not the heaven far up yonder ? 
Lies the earth not sound beneath us, firm ? 
And rise not, friendly gazing 
Upon us, eternal stars ? 
Looks not mine eye within thine own. 
And crowds not all this 
Toward thine head and heart. 
Weaving in eternal mystery 
Invisibly, visibly, beside thee? 
Fill with it all thine heart, grand as it is, 
And when this feeling gives thee pure and rapturous bliss, 
Then name it what thou wilt; 
Bliss name it! Heart! Love! God! 
I have no name to offer 
For it! Feeling is all; 
But sound and smoke is Name, 
Veiling Heaven's bright glow, 

Margaret. 
All this is fine and good, I know; 
In the main the priest doth say the same, 
Only with somewhat different phrases. 

Faust 
Everywhere, in all places. 

All hearts beneath Heaven's bright day proclaim it, 
Each in its language doth name it; 
Why should / not say it as gladly?

Margaret, 
To hear it thus, it sounds not badly, 
Yet something crooked there seems to be. 
For thou hast no Christianity. 

Faust 
Dear child! 

Margaret 
Long has it troubled me 
To see thee in such company. 

Faust 
How so? 

Margaret, 
The man who follows thee of late. 
Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate; 
In all my life naught, believe me, 
Has so hurt my poor heart, doth so grieve me. 
As that man's loathsome face and leer. 

Faust, 
Dearest sweetheart, have no fear ! 

Margaret, 
All my blood is stirred in his presence bold. 
Else, to all men good-will I hold; 
But, much as the yearning to see thee sways me, 
A mysterious fear of that man dismays me; 
And I think him a knave, too, verily ! 
If I do him wrong, God pardon me! 

Faust, 
Such chaps, too, must be tolerated. 

Margaret, 
With the like of him I *d not be mated! 
When he but enters through the door. 
He looks so sneeringly all o*er, 
And half in rage; 

One sees there pan 't nothing his interest engage; 
*T is writ on his brow, his every feature, 
That he may not love a single creature. 
I feel so happy in thine arm, 
So free, so yielding-all, so warm, 
And yet his presence seems my very soul to cow.

Faust, 
Thou pure, foreboding angel, thou ! 

Margaret 
This overcomes me so much, 
That, when he steps to us, or near me. 
My love for thee no longer seemeth such. 
I could not pray when he is by, I fear me; 
And this eats deep into my heart; 
Thou, Henry, too, must feel the smart. 

Faust 
Thou hast now this antipathy! 

Margaret, 
But I must go. 

Faust, 
When giv*st thou me 
One quiet hour when, by love's passion captured. 
Breast seeketh breast, and my soul thine, enraptured ?

Alas, if I but slept alone! 
I *d draw the bolt to-night for thee, my lover; 
But light my mother's sleep has grown. 
And, should she both of us discover, 
I think I 'd die upon the spot. 

Faust, 
Thou angel, fear this matter not. 
Here is a phial ! Three drops, well told, 
If in her drink thou pourest. 
Then deepest sleep her senses will enfold. 

Margaret, 
What would I not, if thou implorest ! 
No harm will come if I should use it ?

She can believe 

Salvation â€” grieves and frets in holy fashion, 
Lest she should hold the man she loves, as lost, undone.

She thinks that surely I ' m a genius now,

She was treated to sweetmeats and wine at each fair; 
Naught could with her beauty, she thought, compare. 
Yet was she so lost to all sense of honor 
As to take the gifts he heaped upon her. 
Such kissing and fondling, off and on;

NIGHT. 

Street before Margaret' s door, 

Valentine. 
(A soldier y Margaret's brother.) 
Whene'er I sat at a drinking bout, 
Where many a one did brag and shout, 
And where the comrades praised aloud 
The prettiest maidens of the crowd. 
And drank a bumper as they praised, 
Half- leaning on their elbows raised: 
I sat and listened quite at rest 
To what those braggarts there confessed. 
And stroked my beard in smiling mood, 
And took the brimming glass in hand. 
And said: ** All this is very good! 
But is there one in all the land 
To equal Margaret ? One who dare 
To her a candle hold, â€” with her compare? " 
Top! Top! Cling! Clang! The glasses rang! 
** He's right," full many a trooper cried, 
" Of all her sex she is the pride! " 
And dumb sat all that swaggering gang. 
And now ? â€” I could tear my hair in passion. 
And climb up the walls in furious fashion! â€” 
With sneers and taunts they all will quit me. 
And every villain of them twit me ! 
Like to a sorry debtor sitting, 
Each idle word will set me sweating ! 
And should I thrash them, one or many, 
I could not give the lie to any. 

But what comes yonder? Who sneaks there? 

If I mistake not, two, I swear! 

\i he's one, by his skin I '11 pin him; 

He '11 not go hence with life within him !

Faust Mephistopheles. 

Faust 
As from yon window of the sacristry 
The ever-burning lamp sends forth its glimmer, 
And sidewards glows, but dim and dimmer. 
While darkness all around doth lie: 
So, like the night, my heart is cheerless. 

Mephistopheles, 
And I am like the tom-cat, fearless. 
That o'er the long fire-ladders creeps. 
And softly round the walls then sweeps. 
I am quite virtuous in my mind, 
A little thievish, and to wantonness inclined. 
In all my limbs I feel it stirring. 
The gay Walpurgis-Night so near. 
Another day sees it recurring: 
Why one wakes theriy is very clear. 

Faust. 
Meanwhile, may not the treasure rise to sight. 
Which yonder glows with glistening light ? 

Mephistopheles, 
Shortly thou canst enjoy that pleasure. 
Lifting the kettle with its treasure. 
I took a squint the other day: 
Brimful the lion-dollars lay. 

Faust. 
And not a jewel, not a ring. 
To adorn my sweetheart, her charms enhancing ? 

MephistopheUs. 
I think I saw just such a thing, 
A chain of pearls, with pale lustre glancing. 

Faust, 
That 's right! It always hurts me sore. 
When without a present I seek her door. 

Mephistopheles. 
Still, you are foolish in delaying 
To gain enjoyment without paying.

But come! We must now vanish in a hurry; 
Already rises there a murderous cry â€” 
I know how one may the police defy, 
But Penal Courts keep me in fright and worry. 

Martha, (at the window,) 
Come out ! Come out! 

Margaret, (at the window, ) 
Quick, bring a light! 
Martha, (as above,) 
They rail and scuffle, shout and fight! 

People, 
Already one lies slain ! 

Martha, (coming out, ) 
The murderers, whither have they run? 

Margaret, (coming out,) 
Who lies here? 

People, 
Thy own mother's son. 
Margaret, 
Almighty God, what pain !

I 'm dying! â€” 'Tis a soon told tale, 
And sooner done, I fear.

Why stand there, dames, and howl and wail ? 
List to my say â€” draw near. 

( They all gather around him,^ 
My Margaret, see, still young art thou, 
And not half smart enough, I vow; 
Thy trade's in sorry plight. 
In confidence I speak to thee: 
Since thou didst choose a whore to be, 
Why, be one then, outright! 

Margaret. 
My brother! God! Such words to me ? 

Valentine. 
In this farce let our Lord God be! 
What's done, alas! is even done, 
And that which shall be, follows on. 
With one in secret didst commence, 
Soon others come, in consequence. 
And, when a dozen were with thee. 
For all the town wilt ready be. 

When shame first to the light comes stealing, 

She's brought in secret to the world. 

And then the veil of night's unfurled. 

Her head and ears concealing; 

Yea, of murder one thinketh sedately. 

But, when she grows and flaunts quite gay. 

Uncovered struts she past by day. 

Yet is not the least bit more stately. 

The more her face becomes a fright. 

The more she seeks the broad daylight. 

E'en now I seethe time, I think. 

When all the honest burghers shrink 

Appalled, as from a corpse infected. 

From thee, thou jade, by all rejected. 

Thy wretched heart shall sore affright thee, 

If they but look thee in the face! â€” 

No golden chain henceforth delight thee.

Nor at the altar shalt find grace! â€” 

No handsome laces shall bedight thee, 

Nor merry dances e'er invite thee! â€” 

But in some dark hole shalt secrete thee, 

With none but beggars and'cripples to meet thee!^ 

And, even should God pardon thee, 

On Earth accursed forever be! 

Martha. 
Commend your soul to the Redeemer! 
Would you add slander, you blasphemer ? 

Valentine. 
Could I but at thy withered frame, 
Vile, bawdy hag, lost to all shame, 
I 'd hope for pardon and remission 
Of all my sins without contrition. 

Margaret. 
My brother! Oh, what hellish pain! 

Valentine. 
I tell thee, all thy tears are vain ! 
When thou thy honor didst forego. 
Thou gav*st my heart its deepest blow. 
I go, through slumber of the grave, 
To God â€” a soldier â€” fearless â€” brave.

High MdsSy Organ and Hymn, Margaret among many peo-

Evil Spirit, 
How different, Margaret, was it, 
When thou, all innocent, 
Here to the altar cam'st. 
From the thumbed little prayer-book 
Thy prayers didst prattle. 
Half childish play, 
HalfGodin thy heart! 
Margaret! 

Where dwells thy thought ? 
Within thy heart 
What fearful crime ? 

Pray'st for the soul of thy poor mother, .who 
Through thee in lasting pain, forever, yonder sleeps ? 
Upon thy threshold, whose the blood ? 
And stirs not beneath thy heart 
That which, with quickening life. 
Frightens thee and itself 
With its misgiving presence ? 

Margaret, 
Woe! Woe! 

Could I free me of these thoughts 
Which cross my brain hither and thither. 

Against my will! 

Chorus, 
Dies irae, dies ilia 
Solvet saeclum in favilla.

WALPURGIS-NIGHT. 

Hartz Mountains, District of Schirke and Elend, 
Faust. Mephistopheles, 

Mephistopheles, 
Would not a broomstick suit thee to perfection ? 
The sturdiest he-goat I would like to ride. 
Our goal lies far if we take this direction. 

Faust. 
While yet my legs are fresh, up this rough mountain-section 
This knotty stick my steps will guide. 
What need to shorten thus the way! 
Now labyrinthine valleys gladly hailing, 
Then yonder rocky hillock scaling. 
From which the brooklet falls in misty spray. 
That is the joy which seasons such a day! 
Spring thrills the birches with its presage, 
And e'en the pine tree lists its call; 
Should not our limbs, too, heed the tender message ? 

Mephistopheles. 
In truth, I feel it not at all! 
My body wintry pleasures prizes; 
Frost I desire upon my road, and snow. 
â€” How sadly, incomplete and lurid rises 
The red moon's orb with dim, belated glow. 
And shines so faintly, that each onward movement 
Brings one against a rock, against a tree ! 
A will-o' -th' -wisp were an improvement! 
I see one yonder, burning merrily. 
Hallo! My friend! Wilt give us thine assistance? 
Why flicker vainly in the distance ? 
Be kind enough to light us up this height! 

Will-o'-th'-wisp. 
Through reverence, I hope, I shall be able 
To force my nature so unstable; 
In zig-zag courses we take much delight.

Mephistopheles. 
So, so! He would Mankind ape in this matter! 
Walk straight in th' fiend's name! Or I '11 shatter 
Your flickering, trembling little life in twain ! 

Will-o'-th'-wisp. 
I see, you are the lord of the domain, 
And I will serve you with elation. 
But that, to-day, the mount is magic-mad, you know, 
And if a will-o'-th'-wisp is forced the roads to show, 
Th^nyou must show some toleration. 

Fatist. Mephistopheles. Will-o' -thU-wisp. 
{In alternating song. ) 
Spheres of dreams and magic safely 
Have we entered; do thou speed us! 
Serve with credit, guide us bravely. 
That our course may onward lead us 
'Long the wide, the desert border! 

See, the trees in endless order 
Hurry past in swift gyration; 
Mark the cliff' 's bold inclination. 
And the rocky noses showing, â€” 
List' their snoring, list' their blowing! 

O'er the stones, through heather flowing, 
Brook and brooklet are descending. 
Hear I murmurs ? Songs ascending ? 
Hear I love- plaints ? 'Tis a vision. 
Voices of those days elysian ? 
Sounds of hope, of love's devotion! 
And the echo, like tradition 
Of old times, comes faintly blending. 

Uhu! Shoohoo! Nearer sounding! 
Screech-owls, plovers, jays abounding! 
Are they all awake, in motion ? 
Is 't the lizard here that rushes 
Paunchy, long-legged, through the bushes ?

And the roots, like serpents, scare us, 
Twist from rock and sand, unravel 
Uncouth fetters from the gravel. 
To affright us, to ensnare us; 
Forth, from sturdy knots unfurling. 
They stretch polyp-fibres, curling 
'Round the wanderer. Mice in legions. 
Thousand-colored, through the regions 
Of the moor and heath are bounding! 
And the glow-worms fly before us. 
Crowding, swarming, hover o'er us 
As an escort all-confounding. 

Say now, do we rest, unknowing, 
Or progress, still onward going ? 
All seems turning, flying, glowing: 
Rocks and trees, that make queer faces. 
Aimless lights, that fill all spaces, 
Each increasing still, and growing! 

Mephisioplieles. 
Grasp my cloak with all thy powers ! 
Here a middle-summit towers, 
Where one sees with wond'ring gaze 
Mammon in the mount ablaze. 

Faust, 
How strangely through the gorges glances 
A faint, dim gleam like flush of day ! 
Down the abyss it quivers, dances. 
And sheds in deepest clefts a ray. 
Here gases fl6at, and vapors yonder. 
There shines a glow through fog and mists; 
Here like a slender thread doth wander, 
Then like a spring it leaps and twists. 
Here, o'er a vast expanse, it scatters 
In hundred veins along the vale. 
And here the narrow corner shatters 
The glistening sheen far down the trail. 
There dance the sparks their fairy mazes,

Like golden sand by breezes blown ; 
But look ! The rocky mountain blazes 
And bursts in flame from every stone. 

Mephistopheles. 
Has not, upon this gay occasion 
His house Sir Mammon grandly lit ? 
*Tis lucky, thou hast witnessed it; 
E'en now I feel the frantic guests' invasion. 

Faust. 
How through the air the stormwinds rave! 
And how they strike my neck with force unbounded ! 

Mephistopheles, 
Grasp firmly thou the rock's old ribs, time-founded ! 
Else they will hurl thee down, into this gulfs dark grave. 
A vapor thickens the night. 
Hark, how the storms the forest smite ! 
Frightened, the owls are scattered. 
Hark, the columns are shattered. 
Evergreen palaces wrecking. 
Branches are moaning and breaking ! 
The trunks sonorously droning ! 
The roots sharply creaking and groaning! 
In horrible chaos, each smashing 
The other, together they 're crashing, 
And through the wreck and ruin-filled abysses 
The tempest surges and hisses. 
Hear'st thou voices o'er us pealing? 
Now afar, now nearer stealing ? 
Yea, the mountain all along 
Streams a furious, magical song ! 

Witches in Chorus, 
The witches on the Brocken convene. 
The stubble is yellow, the crop is green. 
The mighty throngs there gather and brawl. 
Sir Urian thrones o'er them all. 
Thus haste we over stone and stock; 
It â€” s the witch, it â€” s the buck.

A Voice. 
Old Baubo comes alone with speed. 
A farrow sow is her willing steed. 

Chorus, 
Then honor, to whom honor is due ! 
Dame Baubo first, to lead the crew! 
Old mother upon a good old sow, 
All witches follow quickly now. 

A Voice. 
Which road didst thou come? 

A Voice, 

Over the Ilsenstone! 
There I looked in the nest where the owl lay prone. 
What big eyes she opened ! 

A Voice. 

To hell with thy banter! 
Why so fiercely dost canter! 

A Voice. 
She 's hurt me, in speeding â€” 
See the wounds, how they're bleeding! 

Witches. ( Chorus. ) 
The road is broad, the road is long; 
What crazy crowd are we among ? 
It pricks the fork, it chafes the broom. 
The child is stifled, bursts the womb. 

Wizards. ( Semi- Chorus. ) 
We creep along with snail-like tread, 
The women, as usual, are ahead. 
For when the road to the Devil we tread 
The woman is thousand steps ahead. 

The Other Half. 
We take it not exactly so: 
With thousand steps a woman may go; 
Yet, howsoever she may run, 
Man with one leap the feat has done.

Voices y {from below.) 
We would gladly follow in your wake, 
We wash and are clean from every stain. 
But barren we are, and so remain.

Emits a thousand sparks of fire.

How far the others are away!

Both Choruses, 

And when the summit we surround, 
Then fly ye low along the ground, 
The heather cover far and near 
With witchhood's rabble everywhere. 

( They settle along the ground, ) 

Mephistopheles, 
That crowds and pushes, slides and rattles. 
That hisses, twirls and moves and prattles, 
That flames, shines, burns with horrid scent, 
A real witches* element! 
Keep close! Or we might part by accident. 
Where art thou ? 

Faust y {in the distance, ) 
Here! 

Mephistopheles, 

What! Yonder dost thou sport now ? ' 
To house-right I must then resort now. 
â€” Give way! Sir Voland comes! Give way, sweet folk, give 

way ! 
Here, Doctor, close to me! Now, one good leap, away, 
And let us from this throng retire; 
It is too mad to suit e*en my desire. 
Aside there, something shines with most peculiar glow ; 
Those bushes draw me nigh and nigher. 
Come, come! We '11 crawl in here below. 

Faust, 
Spirit of Contradiction ! On ! I '11 follow after. 
I think that thy ideas are very bright; 
The Brocken we ascend upon Walpurgis-Night, 
To isolate ourselves, away from mirth and laughter. 

Mephistopheles, 
But see those motley flames ascending! 
A joyous club is here attending. 
One's not alone with two or three.

Faust 
Above there I would rather be ! 
Glow comes, and whirling smoke, to view. 
Crowds gather, Satan in the middle; 
There must be solved full many a riddle. 

Mephistopheles, 
Yet many a riddle is given, too. 
Let thou the great world surge and riot ! 
We will here house ourselves in quiet. 
Since ancient times it has been said. 
That in the larger world the little worlds are made. 
Young witches here undressed and nude you see, 
And old ones who, more cunning, veil them. 
Be kind for my sake; come, don't fail them! 
The labor's small, great is the glee. 
I hear a sound like instruments a-playing! 
Cursed noise! One must get used to all their braying. 
Come on! Come on! Denial must not be; 
Advancing first, I show the way to thee, 
And thus renew thine obligation. 
What now? This is no little space, my friend. 
Look all around I Scarcely thou seest the end ! 
A hundred fires burn on this elevation; 
They dance, they talk, they cook, drink and embrace; 
Now tell me, where on earth 's a better place ? 

Fausi, 
And wilt thou now, to gain for us admission. 
Assume the part of devil or magician ? 

Mephistopheles. 
Though I am very apt to go incognito. 
On such a gala-day one must one's orders show. 
The garter docs not deck my knee. 
Yet is the cloven foot the mark that honors me. 
Seest thou yon snail approach ? Slowly the road it paces. 
And with its groping, prying face 
My real nature scents and traces. 
I cannot, if I would, hide here my race.

Since for the last time I ascend the witches' mountain, 
And, since my cask runs muddy, say 
That nigh its dregs is our world's fountain.

For many things here stand and lie. 

Yet is there naught in this collection

Which has not breathed foul infection 

Upon the world and on mankind. 

No dirk is here unstained with blood, and gleaming 

No cup, from whence, to red and healthy lips upborne, 

I have not seen fell poison streaming; 

No gem, which has not caused sweet maids to mourn; 

No sword, that hath not its allegiance broken. 

Hath pierced not from behind its foe in vengeful token.

Faust. 
Then saw I 

Mephistopheles, 
What? 

Faust 

Mephisto, seest thou stand 
A pallid, lovely child, alone, forsaken, yonder ? 
Slowly she glides o'er rock and sand. 
With fettered feet she seems to wander. 
I must confess, in her I see 
A likeness to good Margery. 

Mephistopheles, 
Leave that alone! No use to dwell thereon. 
It is a magic shape, lifeless, an eidolon. 
Such to encounter is not good; 
Its numbing gaze benumbs the human blood, 
And nearly turns one into stone: 
Medusa's story is to thee well known. 

Faust, 
True, these are eyes that death set wildly staring, 
No kindly hand- touch they enjoyed; 
That is the breast I touched with love's fond daring, 
That is the body sweet with which I toyed. 

Mephistopheles. 
That is the witchery, thou easily tempted fool ! 
For each thinks her his sweetheart as a rule. 

Faust, 
What joy, what woe arise before me ! 
Her gaze doth cast a glamour o'er me! â€” 
Strangely surrounds this neck so white and fair 
A scarlet ribbon, brightly gleaming, 
Not broader than a knife-blade seeming. 

Mephistopheles, 
Quite right! I also see it there. 
Oft * neath her arm she bears her head all gory. 
For Perseus lopped it, runs the story.

Ugly ones he lures along.

Inquisitive Traveller. 
Is this a masquerading fraud ? 
Can eyes deceive, I wonder ?

But two are powdered duly. 

Young Witch. 
The powder is, like petticoat, 
For women old and ugly;

Perhaps they *11 say their hearts expand

And also in clear ditches; 
Therefore you see the pious squire 
Consort with fiends and witches.

Yea, to the pious, it is clear, 
Naught causes apprehension; 
They form upon the Blocksberg here 
Full many a convention.

Dancer, 
Here comes a novel choir, indeed! 
Afar, I hear drums sounding; 
** Don't be alarmed; 't is in the reed, 
The Bitterns* tuneless pounding.*' 

Dancing- Master. 
How each one's legs move o'er the ground. 
Escapes then, with composure! 
The cripples jump, the plump ones bound. 
Nor do they mind exposure.

The rabble shows its hate and spite. 
Fell murder 's their desire; 
The brutes the bagpipes now unite 
As once did Orpheus' lyre.

Through doubts, or critics' cavils. 
The Devil must be something, sure, 
How, else, could there be devils ?

For once holds it subjected; 
Forsooth! If I 'm all this, 't is plain

These doings make me greatly vexed, 
I 'm fretted much already; 
Now, first, I find myself perplexed,

Rejoiced at their persistence; 
For by the devils I conclude 
Good spirits have existence.

Our shoes are danced quit through, â€” in fact

From the marshes we arrive. 
Where we long time were growing; 
Yet in the dance we look alive,

While star and fire-glow grace me; 
Oddly in the grass I lie :

The grasses down they trample; 
Spirits come, aye, spirits too, 
Who have limbs plump and ample.

DREARY DAY. 



Field. 

Faust Mephistopheles. 

Faust, 

In misery! Despairing! Dwelling in wretchedness upon 
the earth! Straying from place to place, and now imprisoned! 
Thrown as a criminal into a dungeon, and abandoned to fear- 
ful tortures, that dear, unhappy being ! That it should come 
to this, to this ! â€” 

Treacherous, contemptible spirit, and this thou hast con- 
cealed from me! â€” Stand then, stand! Roll thy devilish eyes 
angrily in thy head! Stand, and defy me with thine intoler- 
able presence ! 

Imprisoned! In irreparable misery! Delivered up to evil 
spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling humanity! 

And me, meanwhile, thou hast soothed with absurd dissipa- 
tions, hast hid from me her ever-increasing wretchedness, and 
left her to go helpless to destruction! 

Mephistopheles. 

She is not the first! 

Faust 

Cur! Abominable monster! â€” Change him, thou Infinite 
Spirit, change the worm again into his canine form in which 
he often in nightly sport gambolled around me, rolled beneath 
the feet of the harmless wanderer, and then grasped him, when 
stumbling, by the throat! Change him again to that shape, 
so preferred by him, that he may crawl on his belly in the 
dust before me, that I may spurn him with my foot, the Rep- 
robate ! â€” Not the first ! Woe ! Woe, not to be comprehended 
by any human soul, that more than one being should be 
plunged into the depths of such misery, that the first in its 
writhing death-agony under the eyes of the Ever- Forgiving 
One did not atone for the guilt of all others ! The wretched- 
ness of this one stirs through my veins and life; thou grinnest 
calmly at the fate of thousands!

Mephistopheles, 
Now we are once more at the boundary of our wits, there, 
where you mortals begin to run mad! 

Why dost thou enter into fellowship with us, if thou art too 
weak to go through with it ? Wilt thou soar, yet art not 
proof against dizziness ? Did we force ourselves upon thee, 
or thou thyself upon us ? 

Faust 

Gnash not thou thy voracious fengs at me! It disgusts me! 

Grand, sublime Spirit, who thought me worthy to behold 

Thy Presence, Thou, who knowest my heart and my soul, 

why fetter me to that villain, who rejoices in harm, and who 

gloats over ruin ? 

Mephistopheles, 
Hast thou finished ? 

Faust, 
Save her, or woe unto thee ! The most horrible curse be 
upon thee for thousands of years! 

Mephistopheles, 
I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor withdraw his 
bolts. â€” Save her! â€” Who was it that plunged her into ruin ? I, 
or thou? 

{Faust looks around wildly?) 
Art thou grasping after the thunder ? Well it is, that to 
you contemptible mortals it was not given! To crush the 
innocent respondent, that is the manner of tyrants who wish 
to relieve themselves of difficulties ! 

Faust, 
Bring me to her ! She shall be free! 

Mephistopheles. 
And the danger to which thou exposest thyself? Know, 
that blood-guilt, caused by thy hand, still rests upon that town. 
Over the place where the deed was done, hover avenging 
spirits and lie in wait for the returning murderer. 

Faust 
That, also, from thee ? Murder and death of a world upon 
thee, monster ! Lead me to her, I say, and liberate her !

power in Heaven and on Earth? The jailor's senses I will

mortal hands! I will keep watch, the magic steeds are ready, 
I will carry you off! So much can I do!

NIGHT, OPEN FIELD. 

Faust, Mephistopheles, tearing past on black horses, 
Faust, 
What weave they around the raven-stone ?

I know not what they are cooking or doing. 

Faust, 
Soaring up, sweeping down, bending, descending.

They 're vowing and sowing.

PRISON. 

Faust, 
( With a bunch of keys, and a lamp, before an iron door,) 
How grasps me now a lon^-unwonted trembling, 
Mankind's collected woe grasps hold of me. 
She dwells behind these walls so damp and crumbling, 
And all her crime was fond credulity! 
Dost hesitate now, so near her ? 
Dost thou fear to see, to hear her ? 
On! Thy reluctance hastens fate's decree. 

{^He seizes the lock. Singing is heard inside,^ 

My mother, the harlot. 

Who has killed me! 

My father, the rogue. 

Who has eaten me! 

My sister alone 

Took up each bone. 

And laid them in cool clay; 

Then I changed to a pretty wood bird free; 

Flyaway! Flyaway! 

Faust, 

( Unlocking the door,) 
She little thinks her lover lists in pain. 
And hears the rustling straw, the clanging chain. 

(^He enters.^ 
Margaret, 

( Concealing herself in the straw, ) 
Woe! Woe! They come! Oh, death of bitterness! 

Faust, (in a whisper,) 
Hush, hush ! I come from prison to bear thee. 

Margaret, (prostrating herself before him,) 
Art thou a man, then feel for my distress!

Faust, 
Restrain thy cries, lest sleeping jailors hear thee! 

{He grasps the chains to unlock them,) 
Margaret^ (upon her knees,) 
Who, headsman, unto thee such power 
Over me could give ? 
Why com' St for me at midnight hour? 
Have mercy on me, let me live! 
Is 't not full soon when the morn draws nigh ? 

(She rises up, ) 
I 'm yet so young, so young am I! 
And death pursuing! 

Fair was I, too, and that was my undoing. 
Near was the friend, now he is far; 
Torn lies the wreath, the flowers scattered are. 
Grasp me not so rudely! 
Spare me! What have I done to thee? 
Be my prayer no vain endeavor, 
In all my days I never saw thee, never ! 

Faust, 
Shall I outlive this anguish ever ! 

Margaret, 
I am now wholly in thy might. 
But let me nurse my babe unheeding; 
I have caressed it all this night â€” 
â€” For spite they took 't, nor heard my pleading. 
And now they say I killed it in my fright. 
And ne'er again shall I be gay. 

They make vile songs on me â€” 't is bad of folk to try it â€” 
An old tale closes thus, they say; 
Who bade them so apply it ? 

Faust^ (throws himself down,) 
To freedom he, who kneels before thee, 
From thraldom's woe would fain restore thee. 

Margaret, (throws herself beside him,) 
Oh, let us kneel, to call the Righteous yonder! 
Behold! The stairway under.

Under the threshold coiling, 

Hell heaves, boiling! 

The Devil, 

In fury appalling. 

Holds noisy revel! 

Faust, {alozid,) 
Margaret! Margaret! 

Margaret y {attentively J) 
That was my lover calling! 

{She springs up, the chains fall off,) 
Where is he ? I * ve heard his accents tender. 
I am free! None my steps shall hinder. 
To his neck will I fly. 
On his bosom lie! 

He called: Margaret! â€” At the threshold yonder 
He stood. Through the midst of hell's howling and thunder, 
Through the relentless, devilish sneer. 
Discerned I the sweet, loving voice full of cheer. 

Faust. 
'TisI! 

Margaret. 
'T is thou! Oh, say it once again! 

{Clasping him,') 
'T is he! 'T is he! Where is now all my pain ? 
The fear the dungeon, the fetters gave me ? 
'T is thou! Thou comest to save me! 
I am saved! â€” Again once more the street is near, 
Where for the first time I did see thee, dear, 
And the garden in full flower. 
Where I and Martha await the hour. 

Faust, {endeavoring to go,) 
Gomel Come with me! 

Margaret, 
Remain now! 
I remain so gladly when thou remainest ! 

{Caresses him.)

Faust 
Again now: 

Away ! If flight thou disdainest, 
Most bitterly we both will rue it. 

Margaret 
No kiss ? Canst no more do it ? 
Scarce gone, my friend, and now returned, 
And hast kissing unlearned ? 
What fears oppress my heart here on thy breast. 
When all thy words and glances were decreeing 
Erewhile to me a perfect heaven of rest, 
And thou didst kiss me as thou wouldst stifle my being ? 
Kiss thou me! 
Or I kiss thee! 

{She embraces him. ) 
Oh woe! Thy lips are cold, 
Are silent quite. 
Where doth thy love 
Now rove ? 
Who wrought me this despite ?

Come! Follow me! Darling, be more bold! 
I '11 fondle thee with zeal a thousand-fold; 
But follow me! I ask thee only this !

And is it thou ? And thou it surely is ? 

Faust. 
' T is I ! Oh, come ! 

Margaret. 
Thou didst unloose this chain. 
And tak'st me in thy lap again. 
How comes it, that thou dost not shrink from me ? â€” 
And knowest thou then, my friend, whom thou wouldst free ? 

Faust. 
Come ! Come ! The night grows late and chill.

Thee, too, â€” 't is thou ! Is * t true, this bliss ?

Quick, wipe it off ! I can't forget

Which thou must prepare for 
To-morrow, and care for;

And right at her side my brother. 
Me a little away. 
Only not too far, I pray ! 
And the little one close on my right breast. 
None else will rest there, sleeping! â€” 
To thy side closely, fondly creeping. 
That was a most sweet, most gracious bliss! 
But now no longer can I attain it. 
Forced seems my love, as if I did feign it. 
As if thou repellest mine every kiss. 
And yet *t is thou, and look'st so good, so mild.

Come? Where?

See, how her head doth quiver ! 

She beckons not, nods not, her heavy head shakes, 

She has slept so long, no more she wakes. 

She slept while we were enjoying: 

What hours of blissful toying ! 

Faust. 
As neither word nor prayer doth sway thee, 
My arms to freedom shall convey thee. 

Margaret. 
Let me go! No, I will suffer no force!

Day? Yes, it is day ! The last day comes with the dawn; 
It was to be my wedding morn!

Woe to my garland, woe ! 
But to sorrow is vain! 
We shall meet once again. 
But not at the dance â€” oh no! 
The crowd is pushing; voiceless they stand; 
The square and the alleys â€¢ 
Scarce hold the throng as it rallies; 
The death-knell tolls, broken is the wand. 
How they are binding and lashing! 
On the blood -stool am I roughly thrown! 
At every neck gleams flashing 

The edge, that flashes at my own !
