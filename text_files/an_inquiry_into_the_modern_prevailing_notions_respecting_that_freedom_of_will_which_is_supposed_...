PREFACE. 



Many find much fault with the callhig professing Chris- 
tians, that diflFer one from another in some matters of opin- 
ion, by distinct names; especially calling them by the 
K names of particular men who have distinguished them- 
h- selves as maintainers and promoters of those opinions : as 
the calling some professing Christians Arminians, from 
Arminius ; others Arians, from Arius ; others Socinians, 
from Socinus, and the like. They think it unjust in itself; 
as it seems to suppose and suggest, that the persons mark- 
ed out by these names received those doctrines which 
they entertain, out of regard to and reliance on, those 
men after whom they are named, as though they made 
them their rule ; in the same manner as the followers of 
Christ are called Christians, after his name, whom they 
regard and depend upon as their great head and rule. 
Whereas, this is an unjust and groundless imputation on 
those that go under the forementioned denominations. 
Thus (say they) there is not the least ground to suppose 
that the chief divines who embrace the scheme of doc- 
trine which is, by many, called Arminianism, believe it 
the more, because Arminius believed it : and that there 
is no reason to think any other, than that they sincerely 
and impartially study the holy Scriptures, and inquire af- 
ter the mind of Christ, with as much judgment and sin- 
cerity as any of those that call them by these names ; that 
they seek after truth, and are not careful whether they 
think exactly as Arminius did^ yea, that in some things 
they actually differ from him. This practice is also es- 
teemed actually injurious on this account, that it is sup- 
posed naturally- to lead a multitude to imagine the differ- 
ence between persons thus named and others to be great-

er than it is ; yea, as though it were so great, that tijpy 
must be as'it were another species of beings. And they 
object against it as arising from an uncharitable, narrow, 
contracted spirit, which they say, commonly inclines per- 
sons to confine all that is good to themselves and their 
own party, and to make a wide distinction between them- 
selves and others, and stigmatise those that differ from them 
with odious names. They say, moreover, that the keeping 
up such a distinction of names has a direct tendency to 
uphold distance and disaffection, and keep alive mutual 
hatred among Christians, who ought all to be united in 
friendship and charity, however they cannot in all things 
think alike. 

I confess, these things are very plausible. And I will 
not deny, that there are some unhappy consequences of 
this distinction of names, and that men's infirmities and 
evil dispositions often make an ill improvement of it. But 
yet 1 humbly conceive these objections are carried far be- 
yond reason. The generality of mankind are disposed 
enough, and a great deal too much, to uncharitableness, 
and to be censorious and bitter towards those that differ 
from them in religious opinions; which evil temper of 
mind will take occasion to exert itself from many things 
in themselves innocent, useful, and necessary. But yet 
there is no necessity to suppose that the thus distinguish* 
ing persons of different opinions by different names, arises 
mainly from an uncharitable spirit. It may arise from the 
disposition there is in mankind (whom God has distin- 
guished with an ability and inclination for speech) to im- 
prove the benefit of language, in the proper use and de- 
sign of names, given to things which they have often 
occasion to speak of, or signify their minds about ; which 
is to enable them to express their ideas with ease and 
expedition, without being encumbered with an obscure 
and difficult circumlocution. And the thus distinguish- 
ing persons of different opinions in religious matters may 
not imply, nor infer, any more than that there is a differ- 
ence, and that the difference is such as we find we have 



li 



FAEFACE. V 

often occasion to take notice of, and make mention of. 
That which we have frequent occasion to speak of (what- 
ever it be that gives the occasion), this wants a name : 
and it is always a defect in language, in such cases, to be 
obliged to make use of a description instead of a name. 
Thus we have often occasion to speak of those who are 
the descendants of the ancient inhabitants of France, who 
were subjects or heads of the government of that land, 
and spake the language peculiar to it ; in distinction frpm 
the descendants of the inhabitants of Spain, who be- 
longed to that community, and spake the language of that 
country. And therefore we find the great need of dis- 
tinct names to signify these different sorts of people, and 
the great convenience of those distinguishing words French 
and Spaniards; by which the signification of our minds 
is quick and easy, and our speech is delivered from the 
burden of a continual reiteration of diffuse descriptions, 
with which it must otherwise be- embarrassed. 

That the difference of the opinions of those who, in 
their general scheme of divinity, agree with these two 
noted men, Calvin and Arminius, is a thing there is often 
occasion to speak of, is what the practice of the latter 
itself confesses ; who are often, in their discourses and 
writings, taking notice of the supposed absurd and per- 
nicious opinions of the former sort. And therefore the 
making use of different names in this case cannot reasona- 
bly be objected against, or condemned, as a thing which 
must come from so bad a cause as they assign. It is easy 
to be accounted for, without supposing it to arise from 
any other source than the exigence and natural tendency 
of the state of things ; considering the faculty and dis- 
position God has given to mankind, to express things 
wbicfa they have frequent occasion to mention, by certaio 
distinguishing names. It is an effect that is similar to what 
we see arise, in innumerable cases which are parallel, 
where the cause is not at all blameworthy. 

Nevertheless, at first, I had thoughts of carefully avoidt^ 
iog the use of the appellation Arminian in this tr^atise^ 



L 



VI PREFACE. 

But I soon found I should be put to great difficulty by it ; 
and that my discourse would be so encumbered with an 
often-repeated circumlocution, instead of a name, which 
would express the thing intended as well and better, that 
I altered my purpose. And therefore I must ask the ex- 
cuse of such as are apt to be offended with things of this 
nature, that I have so freely used the term Arminian in 
the following discourse. I profess it to be without any 
design to stigmatise persons of any sort with a name of re- 
proach, or at all to make them appear more odious. If, 
when I had occasion to speak of those divines who are 
commonly called by this name, I had, instead of styling 
them Arminians, called them the$e men, as Dr. Whitby 
does Calvinistic divines ; it probably would not have been 
taken any better or thought to show a better temper or 
more good manners. I have done as I would be done by in 
this matter. However, the term Calvinistic is, in these 
days, among most, a term of greater reproach than I be term 
Arminian ; yet I should not take it at all amiss to be called 
a Calvinist, for distinction's sake : though I utterly disclaim 
a dependence on Calvin, or believing the doctrines which I 
hold, because he believed and taught them ; and cannot 
justly be charged with believing in everything just as he 
taught. 

But, lest 1 should really be an occasion of injury to 
some persons, I would here give notice, that though I 
generally speak of that doctrine, concerning free will and 
moral agency, which I oppose, as an Arminian doctrine ; 
yet 1 would not be understood as asserting, that every di- 
vine or author whom I have occasion to mention as main- 
taining that doctrine, was properly an Arminian, or one 
of that sort which i» commonly called by that name. 
Some of them went far beyond the Arminians ; and I 
would by no means charge Arminians in general with all 
the corrupt doctrine which these maintained. Thus, for 
instance, it would be very injurious, if I should rank Ar- 
minian divines in general, with such authors as Mr. Chubb. 
I doubt not> many of them have some of his doctrines in 



PBCFACE. ?ii 



abhorrence ; though be agrees, for the most part, with 
Arminians in his notion of the freedom of the will. And, 
on the other hand, though I suppose this notion to be a 
leading article in the Arminian scheme, that which, if 
pursued in its consequences, will tnily infer, or naturally 
lead to all the rest ; yet I do not charge all that have held 
this doctrine with being Arminians. For whatever may 
be the consequences of the doctrine really, yet some that 
hold this doctrine may not own nor see tliese consequen- 
ces ; and it would be unjust, in many instances, to charge 
every author with believing and maintaining all the real 
consequences of his avowed doctrines. And I desire it 
may be particularly noted, that though I have occasion, 
in the following discourse, often to mention the author of 
the book, entitled " An fissay on the Freedom of the Will 
in God and the Creature," as holding that notion of free- 
dom of will which I oppose ; yet I do not mean to call 
him an Arminian : however, in that doctrine he agrees 
with Arminians, and departs from the current and general 
opinion of Calvinists. If the afuthor of that Essay be the 
same as it is commonly ascribed to, he, doubtless, was not 
one that ought to bear that name. But however good a 
divine he was in many respecta, yet that particular Armi- 
nian doctrine which he maintained is never the better for 
being held by such an one, nor is tliere less need of op- 
posing it gn that account ; but rather is there the more 
need of it ; as it will be likely to have the more perni- 
cious influence, for being taught by a divine of his name 
and character; supposing the doctrine to be wrong, and 
in itself to be of an ill tendency. 

I have nothing further to say by way of preface, but 
only to bespeak the reader's candor, and calm attention 
to what I have written. The subject is of such import- 
ance as to demand attention, and the most thorough con- 
sideration. Of all kinds of knowledge that we can ever 
obtain, the knowledge of God, and the knowledge of our- 
selves, are the most important. As religion is the great 
business, for which we are created, and on which our hap- 






Vlll PREFACE. 

piness depends ; and as religion consists in an intercourse 
between ourselves and our Maker, and so has its founda- 
tion i() God's nature and ours, and in the relation that God 
and we stand in to each other; therefore a true know- 
ledge of both must be needful, in order to true religion. 
But the knowledge of ourselves consists chiefly in right 
apprehensions concerning those two chief faculties of pur 
nature, the understanding and will. Both are very im- 
portant ; yet the science of the latter must be confessed 
to be of greatest moment ; inasmuch as all virtue and re- 
ligion have their spat more immediately in the will, con- 
sisting more especially in right acts and habits of this fac- 
ulty. And the grand question about the freedom of the 
will, is the main point that belongs to the science of the 
will. Therefore, I say, the importance of this subject 
greatly den^ands the attention of Christians, and especially 
of divines. But as to my manner of handling the sub- 
ject, I will be far from presuming to say, that it is such as 
demands the attention of the reader to what I have writ- 
ten. I am ready to own that in this matter I depend on 
the reader's courtesy. But only thus far I may have some 
color for putting in a claim; that if the reader be dis- 
posed to pass his censure on what I have written, I may 
be fully and patiently heard, and well attended to, before 
I am condemned. However, this is what I would hum- 
bly ask, of my readers ; together with the prayers of all 
sincere lovers pf truth, that I may have much of that Spir- 
it which Christ promised his disciples, which guides into 
all truth; and that the blessed and powerful influences 
of this Spirit would make truth victorious in the world.

ETC. ETC. 

PART I. 

WHEREIN ARE EXPLAINED AND STATED VARIOUS TERMS 
AND THINGS BELONGING TO THE SUBJECT OF THE EN- 
SUING DISCOURSE. 

SECTION I. 

CONCERNING THE NATURE OP THE WILL. 

It may possibly be thought, that there is no great need 
of going about to de6ne or describe the wilt ; this word 
being generally as well understood as any other words we 
can use to explain it ; and so, perhaps, it would be, had 
not philosophers, metaphysicians, and polemic divines, 
brought the matter into obscurity by the things they have 
said of it. But since it is so, I think it may be of some 
use, and will tend to the greater clearness in the follpw- 
ing discourse, to say a few things concerning it. 

And therefore 1 observe, that the mill (without any 
metaphysical refining) is plainly, thai by which the mind 
chooses anything. The faculty of the will is that faculty 
or power, or principle of mind, by which it is capable of 
choosing ; an act of the will is the same as an act of 
choosing or choice. 

If any think' it is a more perfect definition of the will 
to say, tl)at, It is that by which the soul either chooses or 
refiises, I am content with it ; though I think that it is 

2 



14 THE NATURE OF THE WILL. PART I. 

enough to say, It is that by which the soul chooses ; for 
in every act of will whatsoever, the mind chooses one 
thing rather than another; it chooses something rather 
than the contrary, or rather than the want or non-exis- 
tence of that thing. So, in every act of refusal, the mind 
chooses the absence of the thing refused ; the positive and 
the negative are set before the mind for its choice, and it 
chooses the negative ; and the mind's making its choice 
in that case is properly the act of the will ; the will's de* 
termining between the two is a voluntary determining, but 
that is the same thing as making a choice. So that what- 
ever names we call the act of the will by, choosing^ re- 
fusings approving^ disapproving^ liking, disliking, em- 
bracing y rejecting, determining, directing, commanding, 
forbidding, inclining, or being averse, a being pleased or 
displeased with; all may be reduced to this oi choosing. 
For the soul to act voluntarily, is evermore to act c/ec- 
tively. 

Mr. Locke * says, " The will signiGes nothing but a 
power or ability to prefer or choose.*^ And in the fore- 
going page says, " The word preferring seems best to ex- 
press the act of volition ;" but adds, that ^' it does it not 
precisely ; for, (says he,) though a man would prefer fly- 
ing to walking, yet who can say he ever wills it ?" But 
the instance he mentions does not prove that there is any- 
thing else in willing but merely preferring ; for it should 
be considered what is the next and immediate object of 
the will, with respect to a man's walking, or any other 
external action ; which is, not being removed from one 
place to another, on the earth or through the air — tl>ese 
are remoter objects of preference — ^but such or such an im- 

* Human Understanding. Edit. 7, vol. i. p. 197.

SECT. I. THE NATURE OF THE WILL. 15 

mediate exertion of himself. The thing nextly chosen or 
preferred when a nuin wills to walk, is, not his being re» 
moved to such a place where he would be, but such an 
exertion and motion of his legs and feet, etc. in order to it. 
And his willing such an alteration in his body in the present 
moment, is nothing else but his choosing or preferring snob 
an alteration in his body at such a moment, or his liking 
it better than the forbearance of it. And God has so 
made and established the human nature, the soul being 
united to a body in ppoper state, that the soul preferring or 
choosing such an immediate exertion or alteration of the 
body, such an alteration instantaneously folicwr. There 
is nothing else in the actions of my mind, th&c X cm con- 
scious of while I walk, but only my preferring t:.- ^Ir osing, 
through successive iTU>ments, that there s1)C'j/< !:3 such 
alterations of my external sensations and motions, tcc;3:her 
with a concurring habitual expectation that it wi^^ ^^s so; 
baving ever found by experience, that on such an imma* 
diate preference, such sensations and motions do actuall 
instantaneously and constantly arise. But it is not so in 
the case of flying ; though a man may be said remotely to 
choose or prefer flying, yet he does not choose or prefer, 
incline to, or desire, under circumstances in view, any im- 
mediate exertion of the members of his body in orderto.it, 
because he has no expectation that he should obtain the 
desired end by any such exertion ; and he does not pre- 
ferjorjncline to any bodily exertion or eflfort under this 
apprehended circumstance, of its being wholly in vain. 
So that if we carefully distinguish the proper objects of 
tlie several acts of the will, it will not appear, by this and 
such like instances, that there is any difference between 
volition and preference ; or that a man's choosing, liking 




i 



16 THE NATURE OF THE WILL. PART I. 

best, or being best pleased with a thing, are not tbe same 
' with his willing that thing ; as they seem to be according 
. to those general and more natural motions of men, accord- 
Zing to which language is formed. Thus, an act of the 
/ will is commonly expressed by its phasing a man to do 
I thus or thus ; and a man doing as he wilUf and doing as 
^fae pleases y are the same thing in common speech. 

Mr. Locke * says, " The will is perfectly distinguished 
from desire, which in the very same action may have a 
quite contrary tendency fix>m that which our wills set us 
upon. A man (says he), whom I cannot deny, may 
oblige me to use persuasions to another, which, at the same 
time 1 am speaking, I may wish may not prevail on him. 
In this case, it is plain the will *and desire run counter.'' 
I do not suppose that wiU and desire are words of pre- 
cisely the same signiGcation : ijoill seems to be a word of 
a more general signification, extending to things present 
and absent. Desire respects something absent. I may 
prefer my present situation and posture, suppose sitting 
still, or having my eye» open, and so may will it. But 
yet I cannot think they are so entirely distinct, that they 
can ever be properly said to run counter. A man never, 
in any instance, wills anything contrary to his desires, or 
. desires anything contrary to his will. The forementioned 
instance, which Mr. Locke produces, does not prove that 
he ever does. He may, on some consideration or other, 
will to utter speeches which have a tendency to persuade 
another, and still may desire that they may not persuade 
him ; but yet his will and desire do not run counter at all ; 
the thing which be wills, the very same he desires ; and 
he does not will a thing, and desire the contrary, in any

particular. In this instance, il is not carefully observed 
what is the thing willedy and what is the thing desired : 
if it were, it would be found that will and desire do not 
clash in the least. Tiie thinc^ willed on some considera- 
tion, is to utter such words ; and certainly, the same con- 
sideration so influences him, that he does not desire the 
contrary ; all things considered, he chooses to utter such 
words, and does not desire not to utter them. And so as 
to the thing which Mr. Locke speaks of as desired, viz. 
That the words, though they tend to persuade, should not 
be effectual to that end ; his will is not contrary to this ; 
he does not will that they should be effectual, but rather 
wills that they should not, as he desires. In order to prove 
that the will and desire may run counter, it should be 
shewn that they may be contrary one to the other in the 
same thing, or with respect to the very same object of will 
or desire ; but here the objects are two ; and in each, 
taken by themselves, the will and desire agree. And it 
is no wonder that they should not agree in different things, 
however little distinguished they are in their nature. The 
will may not agree with the will, nor desire agree with 
desire, in different things. As in this veryJustance which 
Mr. Locke mentions, a person may, on some considera- 
tion, desire to use persuasions, and at the same time may 
desire they may not prevail ; but yet nobody will say, 
that desire runs CQunter to desire, or that this proves that 
desire is perfectly a distinct thing from desire. The like 
might be observed of the other instance Mr. Locke pro- 
duces, of a man's desiring to be eased of pain, etc. 

But not to dwell any longer on this, whether desire and 
will, and whether preference and volition^ be precisely 
the same things or no ; yet, I trust it will be allowed by

all, that in every act of will there is an act of choice ; that 
in every volition there is a preference, or a prevailing in- 
clination of the soul, whereby the soul, at that instant, is 
out of a state of perfect indifference, with respect to the 
direct object of the volition. So that in every act, or go- 
ing forth of the will, there is some preponderation of the 
mind or inclination one way rather than another ; and the 
soul had rather have or do one thing than another, or than 
not IQ have or do that thing ; and that there, where there 
is absolutely no preferring or choosing, but a perfect con-' 
tinuing equilibrium, there is no volition. 

SECTION II. 

CONCERNING THE SETEBMINAJION OF THE WILL. 

By determining the will, if the phrase be used with 
any meaning, must be intended, causing that the act of 
the will or choice should be thus, and not otherwise ; and 
the will is said to be determined, when, in consequence of 
some action or influence, its choice is directed to, and fix- 
ed upon, a particular object. As, when we speak of the 
determination of motion, we mean causing the motion of 
the body to be such a way, or in such a direction, rather 
than another. 

To talk of the determination of the will, supposes an 

r effect which must have a cause. If the will be deter- 

; mined, there is a determiner. This must be supposed to 

be intended even by them that say the will determines it- 

\ self. If it be so, the will is both determiner and deter- 

. mined ; it is a cause that acts and produces effects upon 

itself, and is the object of its own influence and action.

the mil? it would be very tedious and unnecessary at 
present to enumerate and examine all the various opin* 
ions which have been advanced concerning this matter ; 
nor is it needful that I should enter into a particular dis- 
quisition of all points debated in disputes on that question. 
Whether the will always follows the last dictate of the 
understanding. It is sufficient to my present purpose to 
I' say, It is that motive which, as it stands in the view of 
\ the mindy is the strongest, that determines the will; but 
Ht may be necessary that I should a little explain my 
meaning in this. 






By motive, I mean the whole of that which moves, ex- 
cites, or invites, the mind to volition, whether that be one 
thing singly, or many things conjunctly. Many particu- 
lar things may concur and unite their strength to induce 
thejmind ; and when it is so, all together are, as it were, 
one complex motive. And when I speak of the strongr 
est motive, I have respect to the strength of the whole 
that operates to induce to a particular act of volition, 
whether that be the strength of one thing alone, or of 
many together. 

Whatever is a motive, in this sense, must be some- 
thing that is extant in the view or apprehension of the 
understanding, or perceiving faculty. Nothing can in- 
duce or invite the mind to will or act anything, any 
further than it is perceived, or is some way or other in 
the mind's view ; for what is wholly unperceived, and 
perfectly out of the mind's view, cannot affect the mind 
at all. It is most evident, that nothing is in the mind, or 
reaches it, or takes any hold of it, any otherwise than as 
it is perceived or thought of. 

And I think it. must also be allowed by all, that every 



20 WHAT DETERUINES THE WILL. PART I. 

thing that is properly called a motive, excitement, or in- 
ducement, to a perceiving willing agent, has some sort * 
and degree of tendency or advantage to move or excite 
the will, previous to the effect, "or to the act of the wiU ; 
excited. This previous tendency of the motive is what 1 
call the strength of the motive. That motive wliich has 
a less degree of previous advantage or tendency to move 
the will, or that appears less inviting, as it stands in the i 
view of the mind, is what I call a weaker motive. On 
the contrary, that which appears most inviting, and has, by ' 
what appears concerning it to the understanding or appre- i 
hension, the greatest degree of previous tendency to ex- 
cite and induce the choice, is what I call the strongest ! 
motive* And in this sense, l suppose the will is always 
determined by the strongest motive. i 

Things that exist in the view of the mind, have their 
strength, tendency, or advantage, to move or e^ciie its 
will, from many things appertaining to the nature and cir- \ 

cumstances of the thing viewed, the nature and circum- 
stances of the mind that views, and the degree and man- 
ner of its view ; which it would perhaps be hard to make 
a perfect enumeration of. But so much I think may bf 
determined in general, without room for controversy, that 
whatever is perceived or apprehended by an intelligent 
and voluntary agent, which has the nature and influenf^-e 
of a motive to volition or choice, is considered or viewt 
as good ; nor has it any tendency to invite or engage the 
election of the soul in any further degree than it appears 
such. For to say otherwise, would be to say, That 
things that appear have a ten/dency by the appearance 
they make to engage the mind to elect them some other 
way than by their appearing eligible to it, which is ab- 



J

SECT. II. WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. 31 

surd ; and therefore it must ;be true, in some sense, that 
the will always is as the greatest apparent good is. But 
only, for the right understanding of this, two things must 
be well and distinctly observed. 

1. It must be observed in what sense I use the term 
good; namely, as of the same import with agreeable. 
To appear good to the mind, as I use the plirase, is the 
same as to appear agreeable^ or seem pleasing to the 
mind. Certainly, nothing appears inviting and eligible 
to the mind, or tending to'engage its inclination and choice, 
considered as evil or disagreeable ; nor, indeed, as indij^ 
ferenty and neither agreeable nor disagreeable. But if it 
tends to draw the inclination and move the will, it must 
be under the notion of that which suits the mind. And 
therefore that must have the greatest tendency to attract 
and engage it, which, as it stands in the mind's view, 
suits it best and pleases it most ; and in that sense is the . 
greatest apparent good ; to say otherwise, is little, if any 
thing, short of a direct and plain contradiction. 

The word goody in this sense, includes in its significa- 
tion the removal or avoiding of evil, or of that which is 
disagreeable and uneasy. It is agreeable and pleasing to 
avoid what is disagreeable and displeasing, and to have 
uneasiness removed. So that here is included what Mr. 
Locke supposes determines the will. For when he 
speaks of uneasiness as determining the will, he must be 
understood as suppdsing that the end or aim which gov- 
erns in the volition or act of preference, is the avoiding or 
removal of that uneasiness ; and that is the same thing as 
choosing and seeking whatTs more easy and agreeable. . 

2. When I say the will is as the greatest apparent good 
is, or (as I have explained it) that volition has always for 



• '^ "T 1 



22 WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. PAST I. 

its object the thing which appears most agreeable, it must 
be carefully observed, to avoid confusion and needless ob* 
jection, that I speak of the direct and immediate object of 
the act of volition, and not some object that the act of will 
has not an immediate, but only an indirect and remote, 
respect to. Many acts of volition have some remote re- 
lation to an object that is different from the thing most 
immediately willed and chosen. Thus, when a drunlcard 
has his liquor 'before him, and he has to choose whether 
to drink it or no, the proper and immediate objects about 
which his present volition is conversant, and between 
whicii his choice now decides, are his own acts in drink- 
ing the liquor or letting h alone ; and this will certainly 
be dote according to what, in the present view of his 
mind, taken in the whole of it, is most agreeable to h* 
If he chooses or wills to drink it, and not to let it alone 
then this action, as it stands in the view of bis mind, witb 
all that belongs to its appearance there, is more agreeable 
and pleasing than letting it alone. 

But the objects to which this act of volition may relate 
more remotely, and between which his choice may de- 
termine more indirectly, are the present pleasure the 
man expects by drinking, and the future misery which he 
judges will be the consequence of it ; he may judge that 
this future misery, when it comes, will be more disagree- 
able and unpleasant than refraining from drinking now 
would be. But these two things are not the proper ob- 
jects that the act of volition spoken of is nextly conver- 
sant about. For the act of will spoken of, is concerni^ng 
present drinking or forbearing to drink. If he wills to 
drink, then drinking is the proper object of the act of his 
will ; and drinking, on some account or other, now ap- 



r 



SECT. II. WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. S3 

pears most agreeable to bim, and suits him best. If be 
ebooses to refrain, tben refraining is the immediate object 
of his will, and is most pleasing to him. If in the choice 
he makes in the case, be prefers a present pleasure to a 
future advantage, which he judges will be greater when 
it comes, then a lesser present pleasure appears more 
agreeable to him than a greater advantage at a distance. 
If, on the contrary, a future advantage is preferred, then 
that appears most agreeable, and suits him best. And so 
still the present volition is as the greatest apparent good 
at present is. 

I have rather chosen to express myself thus, that the 
will always is as the greatest apparent good, or as what 
appears most agreeable is, than to say that the will is cfe- 
termined by the greatest apparent good, or by what seems 
most agreeable ; because an appearing most agreeable or 
pleasing to the mind, and the mind's preferring and choos- 
ing, seem hardly to be properly and perfectly distinct. If 
strict propriety of speech be insisted on, it may more pro- 
perly be said, that the voluntary action which is the im- 
mediate consequence and fruit of the mind's volition or 
choice, is determined by that which appears most agreea- 
ble, than the preference or choice itself; but that the act 
of volition itself is always determined by that, in or about 
tbe^mind's view of the object, which causes it to appear 
most agreeable. I say in or about the mind^s view of the 
object, because what has influence to render an object in 
view agreeable, is not only what appears in the object 
viewed, but also the manner of the view, and the state 
and circumstances of the mind that views. Particularly 
to enumerate all things pertaining to the mind's view of 
the objects of volition, which have influence in their ap- 



24 WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. PART I. 

pearing agreeable to the mind, would be a matter of no 
small difficulty, and might require a treatise by itseir,]^and 
is not necessary to n)y present purpose. I shall therefore 
only mention some things in general. 

I. One thing that makes an object proposed to ehoice 
agreeable, is the apparent nature and circumstances of the 
object. And there are various things of this sort, that 
have a hand in rendering the object more or less agreea* 
ble ; as : 

1. That which appears in the object, which renders it 
beautiful and pleasant, or deformed and irksome^ to the 
mind, viewing it as it is in itself, 

2. The apparent degree of pleasure or trouble attending 
the object, or the consequence of it. Such concomitants 
and consequents being viewed as circumstances of the ob- 
jects, are to be considered as belonging to it, and as it 
were parts of it ; as it stands in the mind's view, as a pro- 
posed object of choice. 

3. The apparent state of the pleasure or trouble that 
appears, with respect to distance of time; being either 
nearer or farther off. It is a thing in itself agreeable to 
the mind, to have pleasure speedily, and disagreeable to 
have it delayed ; so that if there be two equal degrees of 
pleasure set in the mind's view, and ;all other things are 
equal, but only one is beheld as near, and the other far 
off; tlie nearer will appear most agreeable, and so will be 
chosen. Because, though the agreeableness of the objects 
be exactly equal, as viewed in themselves, yet not as 
viewed in their circumstances ; one of them having the 
additional agreeableness of the circumstance of nearness. 

II. Another thing that contributes to the agreeableness 
of an object of choice, as it sts^nds in the mind's view, is 



SECT. II. WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. 25 

the manner of the view. If the object be something which 
appears connected with future pleasure, not only will the 
degree of apparent pleasure have influence, but also the 
manner of the view, especially in two respects. 

1. With respect to the degree of judgment , or ^rmtiess 
of assent, with which the mind judges the pleasure to be 
future. Because it is more agreeable to have a certain hap- 
piness than an uncertain one ; and a pleasure viewed as 
more probable, all other things being equal, is more agreea- 
ble to the mind than that which is viewed as less probable. 

2. With respect to the degree of the idea of the future 
pleasure. With regard to things which are the subject 
of our thoughts, either past, present, or future, we have 
much more of an idea or apprehension of some things 
than others : that is, our idea is much more clear, live- 
ly, and strong. Thus, the ideas we have of sensible 
things by immediate sensation, are usually much more 
lively than those we have by mere imagination, or by con- 
templation of them when absent. My idea of the sun 
when I look upon it, is more vivid than when I only 
think of it. Our idea of the sweet relish of a delicious 
fruit is-usually stronger when we taste it, than when we 
only imagine it. And sometimes, the idea we have of 
things by contemplation is much stronger and clearer 
than at other times. Thus,' a man at one time has a much 
stronger idea of the pleasure which is to be enjoyed in eat- 
ing some sort of food that he loves than at another. Now 
the degree, or strength of the idea or sense that men have 
of future good or evil, is one thing that has great influ- 
ence on their minds to excite choice or volition. When 
of two kinds of future pleasure, which the mind considers 
of, and are presented for choice, both are supposed ex- 

3 



26 WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. PART 1. 

actly equal by the judgment, and both equally cenam, and 
all other things are equal, but only one of them is what 
the mind has a far more lively sense of than of the other ; 
this has the greatest advantage by far to affect and attract 
the mind and move the will. It is now more agreeable 
to the mind to take the pleasure it has a strong and live- 
ly sense of, than that which it has only a faint idea of: 
the view of the former is attended with the strongest ap- 
petite, and the greatest uneasiness attends the want of it; 
and it is agreeable to the mind to have uneasiness remo- 
ved, and its appetite gratified. And if several future en- 
joyments are presented together, as competitors for the 
choice of the mind> some of them judged to be greater, 
and others less, the mind also having a greater sense and 
more lively idea of the good of some of them, and of others 
a less ; and some are viewed as of greater certainty or 
probability than others, and those enjoyments that appear 
most agreeable in one of these respects, appear least so 
in others ; in this case, all other things being equal, the , 
agreeableness of a proposed object of clioice will be in a 
degree some way compounded of the degree of good sup- 
posed by the judgment, the degree of apparent probabili- 
ty or certainty of that good, and the degree of the view 
or sense, or liveliness of the idea the mind has of that 
good ; because all together concur to constitute the de- 
gree in which the object appears at present agreeable ; 
and accordingly, volition will be determined. 

I might further observe, the state of the mind that 
views a proposed object of choice, is' another thing that 
contributes to the agreeableness or disagreeableness of thai 
object: the particular temper which the mind has by na- 
ture, or that has been introduced and established by edu- 



SSC¥. II. WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. 27 

• 

cation, example, •custom, or some other means, or the 
^ frame or state that the mind is in on a particular occasion. 
That object which appears agreeable to one, does not so 
to another ; and the same object does not always appear 
alike agreeable to the same person at different times. It 
is most agreeable to some men to follow their reason, and 
to others to follow their appetites : to some men it is more 
agreeable to deny a vicious inclination than to gratify it, 
others it suits best to gratify the vilest appetites. It is more 
disagreeable to some men than others to counteract a for- 
mer resolution. In these respects, and many others which 
might be mentioned, different things will be most agreea- 
ble to different persons ; and not only so, but to the same 
persons at different times. 

But possibly it is needless and improper to mention the 
frame and state of the mind, as a distinct ground of the 
agreeableness of objects from the other two mentioned be- 
fore; viz. the apparent nature and circumstances of the 
objects viewed, and the manner of the view : perhaps, if 
we strictly consider the matter, the different temper and 
state of the mind makes no alteration as to the agreeable- 
ness of objects any other way, than as it makes the ob- 
^jects tliemselves appear differently beautiful or deformed, 
having apparent pleasure or pain attending them ; and, as 
it occasions the manner of the view to be different, causes 

§ 

the idea of beauty or deformity, pleasure or uneasiness, to 
be more or less lively. 

However, I think so much is certain, that volition, in 
no one instance that can be mentioned, is otherwise than 
the greatest apparent good is, in the manner which has 
been explained. The choice of the mind never departs 
from that wliich, at that lime, and with respect to the di- 



r^

28 WHAT DETERMINES THE WILL. PJlWT I. 

rect and immediate objects of that decision of the mind, ap- 
^ pears most agreeable and pleasing, all things considered. 
If the immediate objects of the will are a man's own ac- 
tions ^ then those actions which appear most agreeable 
to him he wills. If it be now most agreeable to him, al) 
things considered, to walk, then be now wills to walk. 
If it be now, upon the whole of what at present appears 
to him, most agreeable to speak, then he chooses to speak ; 
if it suits him best to keep silence, tben he chooses to keep 
silence. There is scarcely a plainer and more universal 
dictate of the sense and experience of mankind, than that, 
when men act voluntarily, and do what they please, then 
they do what suits them best, or what is most agreeable to 
them. To say that they do what they please, or what 
Sj I pleases them, but yet do not do what is agreeable to them, 
is the same thing as to say they do what they please, but 
do not act their pleasure ; and that is to say, that they do 
what they please, and yet do not do what they please. 

It appears from these things, that in some sense the 
will always follows, the last dictate of the understanding ; 
but then the understanding must be taken in a large 
sense, as including the whole faculty of perception or ap- 
prehension, and not merely what is called reason or judg" 
ment. If by the dictate of the understanding is meant 
what reason declares to be best, or most for the person's 
happiness, taking in the whole of its duration, it is not 
true il)at the will always follows the last dictate of the 
understanding. Such a dictate of reason is quite a differ- 
ent matter from things appearing now most agreeable; 
all things being put together which pertain to the mind's 
present perceptions, apprehensions, or ideas, in any re- 
spect. Although that dictate of reason, when it takes 



S£CT« 111. THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. 39 

place, is one thing that is put into the scales, and is to be 
considered as a thing that has concern in tiie compound 
influence which moves and induces the will ; and is one 
thing that is to be considered in estimating the degree of 
that appearance of good which tl)e will always follows ; 
either as having its influence added to other things, or sub- 
ducted from them. When it concui-s with other things, then 
its weight is added to them, as put into the same scale ; 
but w^en it is against them, it is as a weight in liie opposite 
scale, where it resists the influence of other things : y.et its 
resistance is often overcome by their greater weight, and 
so the act of the will is determined in opposition to it. 

The things which I have said, may, I hope, serve in 
some measure to illustrate and confirm the position I laid 
down in the beginning of this section, viz. that The mil is 
always determined by the strongest motive, or by that view 
of tlie mind which has the greatest degree of previous ten- 
dency to eKcite volition. But whether I have been so 
happy as rightly to explain the thing wherein consists the 
strength of motives, or not, yet my failing in this will not 
overthrow the position itself, which carries much of its 
own evidence with it, and is the thing of chief importance 
to the purpose of the ensuing discourse ; and the trulh of it 
I hope will appear with great clearness before I have fin- 
ished what I have to say on the subject of human liberty. 

SECTION III. 

CONCEENING THE MEANING OF THE TERMS, NECESSITY, IMPOS- 
BIBILITY, INABILITY, ETC., AND OF CONTINGENCE. 

The words necessary, impossible, etc. are abundantly 
used in controversies about free-will and moral agency ; 

3* 



30 THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. PART f. 

and therefore the' sense in which they are used should be 
clearly understood. 

Here I might say, that a thing is then said to be neces- 
sary, when it must be, and cannot be otherwise. But this 
would not properly be a deGnition of ne^cessity, or an ex- 
planation of the word, any more than if I explained the 
word musty by there being a necessity. The words muut, 
can, and cannot, need explication as much as the words 
necessary and impossible ; excepting that the former are 
words that children commonly use, and know something 
of the meaning of, earlier than the latter. 

The word necessary, as used in common speech, is a 
relative term, and relates to some (Supposed opposition 
made to the existence of the thing spoken oC)which is 
overcome, or proves in vain to hinder or alter it. That is 
necessary, in the original and proper sense of the word, 
which is, or will be, notwithstanding all supposable oppo- 
sition. To say that a thing is necessary, is the same thing 
as to say that it is impossible it should not be ; but the 
word impossible is manifestly a relative term, and has re- 
ference to supposed power, exerted to bring a thing to 
pass, which is insufficient_for the effect ; as the word un- 
able is relative, and has relation to ability or endeavor^ 
which is insufficient ; and as the word irresistible is rela- 
tive, and has always reference to resistance which is made, 
or may be made, to some force or power tending to an 
effect, and is insufficient to withstand the power, or hin- 
der the effect. The common notion of necessity and im- 
possibility implies something that frustrates endeavor or 
desire. 

^ Here several things are to be noted : — 
1. Things are said to be necessary in general^ which 



S1!CT..1II. THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. 31 

are or will be, notwithstanding any supposable opposition 
from MA or others y or from whatever quarter. But things i 
are said to be necessary to us which are or will be not-\ 
withstanding all opposition supposable in the case yrom us. 
The same may be observed of the word impossi^le^ and 
other such like terms. 

2. These terms, necessary ^ impossible ^ irresistible^ etc., 
do especially belong to controversy about liberty and mo- 
ral agency, as used in the latter of the two senses now 
mentioned ; viz. as necessary or impossible to us, and with 
relation to any supposable opposition or endeavor of ours. 

3. As the word necessity, in its vulgar and common use, 
is relative, and has always reference to some supposable 
insufficient opposition ; so, when we speak of any thing asf 
necessary to us, it is with relation to some supposable op-l 
position of our wills, or some voluntary exertion or effort I 
of ours to the contrary. For we do not properly make) 
opposition to an event, any otherwise than as we volunta- 
rily oppose it. Things are said to be what must be, or 
necessarily are, as to us, when they are, or will be, though 
we desire or. endeavor the contrary, or try to prevent or 
remove their existence ; but such opposition of ours always 
either consists in, or implies, opposition of onr wills. 

It is manifest, that all such like words and phrases, as 
vulgarly used, are used and accepted in this manner. A 
thing is said to be necessary, when we cannot help it, let 
us do what we will. So anything is said to be impossible \ 
to us, when we would do it, or would have it brought to 
pass, and endeavor it ; or at least may be supposed to de- 
sire and seek it ; but all our desires and endeavors are, or 
would be, vain. And that is said to be irresistible, which l 
overcomes all our opposition, resistance, and endeavor to \ 



32 THE NATURE OP NECESSITY. PART I. 

the contrary. And we are to be said unable to do a thing', 
when our supposable desires and endeavors to do it are 
iosulSicient. 

We are accustomed, in the common use of language^ to 
apply and understand these phrases in this sense : we 
grow up with such a habit, which by the daily use of these 
terms, in such a sense, from our childhood, becomes fixed 
and settled ; so that the idea of a relation to a supposed 
will, desire, and endeavor of ours, is strongly connoted 
with these terms, and naturally excited in our minds, when- 
ever we hear the words used. Such ideas, and these 
words, are so united and associated, that they unavoidably 
go together--K)ne suggests the other, and carries the other 
with it, and never can be separated as long as we live. 
And if we use the words as terms of art, in another sense, 
yet, unless we are exceeding circumspect and wary, we 
shall insensibly slide into the vulgar use of them, and so 
apply the words in a very inconsistent manner. ITIiis ha- 
bitual connection of ideas will deceive and confound us in 
our reasonings and discourses, wherein we pretend id use 
these terms in that manner, as terms of art. 

4. It follows from what has been observed, that when 
these terms, necessary, impossible, irresistible, unable, etc, 
are used in cases wherein ho opposition, or insufficient 
will, or endeavor, is supposed, or can be supposed, but the 
very nature of the supposed case itself excludes and denies 
any such opposition, will, or endeavor, — these terms are 
then not used in their proper signification, but quite be- 
side their use in common speech. The reason is manifest ; 
namely, that in such cases we cannot use the words with 
reference to a supposable opposition, will, or endeavor. 
And therefore, if any man uses these terms in such cases, 



S£CT. III. THE NATUR£ OF NECESSITY. 3S 

he either uses them nonsensically, or in some new sense, 
diverse from their original and proper meaning. As, for 
instance, if a man should affirm after this manner — That 
it is necessary for a man, and what must be, that a man 
should choose virtue rather than vice, during the time that 
he prefers virtue to vice ; and that it is a thing impossible 
and irresistible, that it should be otherwise than that he 
should have this choice, so long as this choice continues. 
Such a man would use tlte terms, musty irresistible, etc. 
with perfect insignificance and nonsense, or in some new 
sense, diverse from their common use ; which is with re- 
ference, as has been observed, to supposable opposition, 
unwillingness, and resistance ; whereas, here, the very 
supposition excludes and denies any such thing ; for the 
case supposed is that pf being willing, and choosing. 

5. It appears from what has been said, that these 
terms, necessary , impossible , etc., are often used by phi- 
losophers and metaphysicians in a sense quite diverse from 
their common use and original signification ; for they ap- 
ply them to many cases in which no opposition is suppo- 
sed or supposable. Thus, they use them with respect 
to God's existence before the creation of the world, when 
there was no other being but He ; so, with regard to ma- 
ny of the dispositions and acts of the divine Being, such 
as his loving himself, his loving righteousness, hating sin, 
etc. So they apply these terms to many cases of the in- 
clinations and actions of created intelligent beings, angels, 
and men ; wherein all opposition of ^the will is shut out 
and denied, in the very supposition of the case. 

Metaphysical or philosophical necessity is nothing dif- 
ferent from their certainty. I speak not now of the cer- 
tainty of knowledge, but the certainty that is in things 



34 THE NATURE OF NECESSITY* PART t» 

themselves, which is the foundation of the certainty of the 
knowledge of them ; or tliat wherein lies the ground of 
the infallibility of the proposition which affirms them. 

_ What is sometimes given as the definition of philoso- 
phical necessity — namely, That by trkich a thing cannot 
hat be, or, whereby it cannot be otherwise, fails of be- 
mg a proper explanation of it, on two accounts ; first, the 
words can, or cannot, need explanation as much as the 
word necessity ; and the former may as well be explain- 
ed by the latter, as the latter by the former. Thus, if 
any one asked us what we mean, when we say, a thing 
cannot but be, we might explain ourselves by saying, we 
mean. It must necessarily be so ; as well as explain ne- 
cessity, by saying. It is that by which a thing cannot but 
be. And secondly, this definition is liable to the fore- 
mentioned great inconvenience ; the words cannot or un- 
able, are properly relative, and have relation to power 
exerted, or that may be exerted, in order to the thing 
spoken of; to which, as 1 have now observed, the word 
necessity, as used by philosophers, has no reference. 

Philosophical necessity is really nothing else than the 
full and fixed connection between the things signified by 
the subject and predicate of a proposition j which af- 
firms something to be true. When there is such a con- 

• uection, then the thing affirmed in the proposition is ne- 
cessary, in a philosophical sense, whether any opposition 
or contrary effort be supposed, or supposable in the case, 

- or no. When the subject and predicate of the proposi- 
tion, which affirms the existence of anything, either sub- 
stance, quality, act, or circumstance, have a full and cer- 
tain connection, then the existence or being of that thing 
18 said to be necessary, in a metaphysical sense. And in 



I 



SECT. III. THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. 35 

this sense I use the word necesiity \n the following dis- 
course, when I endeavour to prove that necessity is not 
inconsistent with liberty. 

. The subject and predicate of a proposition which af- 
firms existence of something, may have a full, fixed, and 
certain connection several ways. 

1 . They may have a full and perfect connection in and 
of themselves y because it may imply a contradiction or gross 
absurdity to suppose them not connected. (Thus, many 
things are necessary in their own nature^ So the eternal 
existence of being, generally considered, is necessary tii 
itself; because it would be, in itself,- the greatest absur- 
dity to deny the existence of being in general, or to say 
there was absolute and universal nothing ; and is, as it 
were, the sum of all contradictions, as might be shewn, 
if this were a proper place for it. So, God's infinity and 
other attributes are necessary. So it is necessary in its 
otvn nature^ that two and two should be four ; and it is 
necessary that all right lines, drawn from the centre of a 
circle to the circumference, should be equal. It is ne- 
cessary, fit and suitable, that men should do to others as 
they would that they should do to them. So, innumera- 
ble metaphysical and mathematical truths are necessary 
in themselves; the subject and predicate of the proposi- 
tion which affirms them are perfectly connected of them- 
selves. 

2. The connection of the subject and predicate of a 
proposition which affirms the existence of something, may 
be fixed and made certain ; because the existence of that 
thing is already come to pass, and either now is or has 
been, and so has, as it were made sure of existence. And 
therefore the proposition, which affirms present and past 



I 



A 



36 



THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. 



PART I. 



\ 



existence of it, may by this means be made certain, and 
necessarily and unalterably true ; the past event has fixed 
and decided the matter, as to its existence, and has made 
it impossible but that existence should be truly predi- 
cated of it. Thus, the existence of whatever is already 
come to pass, is now become necessary ; it is become 
inspossible it should be otherwise than true, that such a 
thing has been. 

3. The subject and predicate of a proposition which 
affirms something to be, may have a real and certain con- 
nection consequentially ; and so the existence of the thing 
may be consequentially necessary, as it may be sorely and 
6rmly connected with something else that is necessary* 
in one of the former respects ; as it is either fully and 
thoroughly connected with that which is absolutely neces- 
sary in its own nature, or with something which has 
already received and made sure of existence. This ne- 
cessity lies tn, or may be explained by, the connection of 
two or more propositions one with another. Things 
which are perfectly connected with other things that are 
necessary, are necessary themselves, by a necessity of 
consequence. 

And here it may be observed, that all things which are 
future, or which will hereafter begin to be, which can be 
said to be necessary, are necessary only in this last way : 
I their existence is not necessary in itself; for if so, they 
always would have existed. Nor is their existence be 
come necessary by being made sure, by being already 
come to pass. Therefore, the only way that anything 
that is come to pass hereafter, is or can be necessary, is 
by a connection with something that is necessary in its own 
nature, or something that already is, or has been ; so that 



( 



^ 



SECT. III. THB NATUAB Or NECESSITT* 37 

the one being supposed, tlie other certainly follows. And 
this, also, is the only way that all things past, excepting 
those which were from eternity, could be necessary 6eybre 
they came to pass^ or could cotne to pass necessarily ; 
and therefore the only way in which any effect or event, 
or anything whatsoever that ever has had or will have a 
beginning, has come into being necessarily, or will here- 
after necessarily exist. And therefore this is the necessity 
which especially belongs to controversies about the acts 
of the will. 

It may be of some use in these controversies, further 
to observe concerning metaphysical necessity, that (agree* 
able to the distinction before observed of necessity, as 
vtdgarly understood) things that exist may be said to be 
necessary, either with r general or particular necessity. 

The existence of a thing may be said to be necessary , 
with a general necessity, when all things whatsoever 
being considered, there is a foundation for certainty of 
their existence ; or when, in the most general and univer- 
sal view of things, the subject and predicate of the propo- 
sition which affirms its existence, would appear with an 
infallible connection. 

An event, or the existence of a tiling, inay be said to 
be necessary with Vi particular necessity, or with regard 
to a particular person, thing, or time, when nothing that 
can be taken into consideration, in or about that person, 
thing, or time, alters the case at all, as to the certainty 
of that event, or the existence of that thing ; or can be 
of any account at all, in determining the infallibility of the 
connection of the subject and predicate in the proposition 
which affirms the existence of the thing ; so that it is all 
one, as to that person or thing, at least, at that time, as 

4 



38 THE NATURE OF NECESSITY. PART I. 

if the existence were necessary with a necessity that is 
most universal and absolute. Thus, there are many 
things that happen to particular persons, which they 
have no hand in, and in the existence of which no will of 
theirs has any concern, at least at that time; which, 
whether they are necessary or not, with regard to things 
in general, yet are necessary to them, and with regard to 
any volition of theirs at that time, as they prevent all acts 
of the will about the afiair. I shall have occasion to ap- 
ply this observation to particular instances in the follow- 
ing discourse. Whether the same things that are neces- 
sary with a particular necessity, be not also necessary 
with a general necessity, may be a matter of future con- 
sideration. Let that be as it will, it alters not the case, 
as to the use of this distinction of the kinds of necessity. 
These things may be sufficient for the explaining of the 
terms necessary and necessity, as terms of art, and as often 
used by metaphysicians and controversial writers in divin- 
ity, in a sense diverse from and more extensive than their 
original meaning in common language, which was before 
explained. 

What has been said to show the meaning of the terms 
necessary and necessity, may be sufficient for explaining 
of the opposite terms impossible and impossibility ; for there 
is no difference, but only the latter are negative, and the 
former positive. Impossibility is the same as negative 
necessity, or a necessity that a thing should not be ; -and 
it is used as a term of art, in a like diversity from the 
original and vulgar meaning with necessity. 

The same may be observed concerning the words 
unable and inability. It has been observed, that these 
terms, in their original and common use, have relation to 



SECT. III. THE NATURE OF NECESSITT. 39 

will and endeavour, as supposable in the case^ and as in- 
sufficient for the bringing to pass the thing willed and 
endeavoured ; but as these terms are often used by phi- 
losophers and divines, especially writers on controversies 
about free-will, they are used in a quite different and far 
more extensive sense, and are applied to many cases 
wherein no will or endeavour for the bringing of the thing 
to pass is or can be supposed, but is actually denied and 
excluded in the nature of the case. 

As the words necessary^ impossible, unable^ etc., are 
used by polemic writers in a sense diverse from tlieir com- 
mon signiBcation, the like has happened to the term con^ 
iingent. Anything is said to be contingent, or to come 
to pass by chance or accident, in the original meaning of 
such words, when its connection with its causes or antece- 
dents, according to the established course of things, is not 
discerned ; and so is what we have no means of the fore- 
sight of. And especially is any thing said to be contin- 
gent or accidental with regard to us, when any thing come? 
to pass that we are concerned in, as occasions or subjects, 
without our foreknowledge, and beside our design and 
scope. 

But the word contingent is abundantly used in a very 
different sense ; not for that whose connection with the 
series of things we cannot discern, so as to foresee the 
event, but for something which has absolutely no previ- 
ous ground or reason, with which its existence has any 
fixed and certain connection. 



40 or NATURAL AND MORAL NECKSSITT. PART T. 



SECTION IV. 

OF THE DISTINCTION OF NATURAL AND MOBAL NBCESSITT5 

AND INABILITY. 

That necessity which has been explained, consisting 
in an infallible connection of the things signified by the 
subject and predicate of a proposition, as intelligent beings 
are the subjects of it, is distinguished into moral and natu- 
ral necessity. 

I shall not now stand to inquire whether this distinction 
be a proper and perfect distinction ; but shall only explain 
how these two sorts of necessity are understood, as the 
terms are sometimes used, and as they are used in the 
following discourse* 

The phrase moral necessity is used variously ; some- 
times it is used for a necessity of moral obligation. So, 
we say a man is under necessity, when he is under bonds 
of duty and conscience, which he cannot be discharged 
from. So, the word necessity is often used for great ob- 
ligation ip point of interest. Sometimes, by moral neces'* 
sity is meant that apparent connection of things which is 
the ground of moral evidence ; and so is distinguished 
from absolute necessity^ or that sure connection of things 
that is a foundation for infallible certainty. In this sense, 
moral necessity signifies much the same as that high de- 
gree of probability which is ordinarily sufficient to satisfy, 
and be relied upon by mankind, in their conduct and be- 
havior in the]world, as they would consult their own safety 
and interest, and treat others properly as members of so- 
ciety. And sometimes by moral necessity is meant that 
necessity of connection and consequence which arises from 



SECT, IV. OF NATURAL AND MORAL NECESSITT. 41 

such moral causesj as the strength of ioclioation, or mo-l 
lives, and the connection which there is in many cases\ 
between these, and such certain volitions and actions. ' 
And it is in this sense that I use the phrase moral neces^ 
sity in the following discourse. 

By natural necessity, as applied to men, I mean such 
necessity as men are under through the force of natural 
causes ; as distinguished from what are called moral causes, i 
such as habits and dispositions of the heart, and moral > 
motives and inducements. Thus, men placed in certain ! 
circumstances are the subjects of particular sensations by 
necessity ; they feel pain when their bodies are woOnded ; 
they see the objects presented before them in a clear light 
when their eyes are opened ; so, they assent to the truth 
of certain propositions as soon as the terms are understood ; 
as that two and two make four, that black is not white, 
that two parallel lines can never cross one another ; so, 
by a natural necessity, men's bodies move downwards 
when there is nothing to support them. 

But here several things may be noted concerning these 
two kinds of necessity. 

1. Moral necessity may be as* absolute as natural ne- 
cessity ; that is, the effect may be as perfectly connected 
with its moral cause as a natural necessary effect is with 
its natural cause. Whether the will in every case is ne- 
cessarily determined by the strongest motive, or whether 
the will ever makes any resistance to such a motive, or 
can ever oppose the strongest present inclination, or not ; 
if that matter should be controverted, yet I suppose none 
will deny, but that, in some cases, a previous bias and in- 
clination, or the motive presented, may be so powerful, 
that the act of the will may be certainly and indissolubly 

4* 



42 OW NATURAL AND MORAL NECCSfllTT. FART I* 

connected therewith. When motives or previous bias are 
very strong, all will allow that there is some difficulty id 
going against them. And if they were yet stronger, the 
difficulty would be still greater. And therefore, if more 
were still added to their strength, to a certain degree, it 
would make the difficulty so great, that it would be who!-* 
ly impossible to surmount it ; for this plain reason, be- 
cause, whatever power men may be supposed to have to 
surmount difficulties, yet that power is not in6nite ; and so 
goes not beyond certain limits. If a man can surmount 
ten degrees of difficulty of this kind with twenty degrees 
of strength, because the degrees of strength are beyond the 
degrees of difficulty ; yet, if the difficulty be increased to 
thirty, or a hundred, or a thousand degrees, and his 
strength not also increased, his strength will be wholly 
insufficient to surmount the difficulty. As, therefore, it 
must be allowed, that there may be such a thing asa^re 
and perfect connection between moral causes and effects ; 
so this only is what I call by the name of moral necessity, 
2. When I use this distinction of moral and natural ne- 
cessity, I would not be understood to suppose, that if any 
thing comes to pass by the former kind of necessity, the 
nature of things is not concerned in it, as well as in the 
latter. I do not mean to determine, that when a moral 
habit or motive is so strong, that the act of the will infal* 
libly follows, this is not owing to the nature of things. 
But these are the names that these two kinds of necessi- 
ty have usually been called by ; and they must be distin- 
guished by some names or other ; for there is a distinction 
or difference between them, that is very important in its 
consequences ; which difierence does not lie so much in 
the nature of the connection as in the two terms connected* 



w • ^ 



BKCT. IV. or NATURAL AND XOBAL NCCESSITT. 43 

The cause with which the effect is connoted is of ,a par* 
ticuiar kind ; viz. that which is of a moral nature ^'either 
some previous habitual disposition, or some motive exhi- 
bited to the understanding. And the effect is al^ of a 
particular kind ; being likewise of a moral nature, consist* 
ing in some inclination or volition of the soul or voluntary 
action. 

I suppose, that necessity which is called natural^ in 
distinction from moral necessity, is so called, because mere 
nature^ as the word is vulgarly used, is concerned without 
anything of choice. The word nature is often used in 
opposition to choice ; not because nature has indeed never 
any hand in our choice ; but this probably comes to pass 
by means that we 6rst get our notion of nature from that 
discernible and obvious course of events, which we ob- 
serve in many things that our choice has no concern in ; 
and especially in the material world, which, in very ma- 
ny parts of it, we easily perceive to be in a settled course ; 
the stated order and manner of succession being very ap- 
parent. But where we do not readily discern the rule 
and connection (though there be a connection, according 
to an established law, truly taking place), we signify the 
manner of event by some other name. Even in many 
things which are seen in the material and inanimate world, 
which do not discernibly and obviously come to pass ac- 
cording to any settled course, men do not call the manner 
of the event by the name of nature^ but by such names • 
as accident, chance, contingent, etc. So men make a / 
distinction between nature and choice, as though they were 
completely and universally distinct. Whereas, I suppose | 
none will deny but that choice, in many cases, arises from : 
nature as truly as other events^ But the dependence and 



44 OF MORAL NECESSITY. FART I, 

connection between acts of volition or choice, and their 
causes, according to established laws, is not so sensible 
and obvious. And we observe that choice is as it were 
a new principle of motion and action, different from that 
established law and order of things which is roost obvious, 
that is seen especially in corporeal and sensible things ; 
and also the choice often interposes, interrupts, and alters 
the chain of events in these external objects, and causes 
them to proceed otherwise than they would do, if let 
alone, and left to go on according to the laws of motion 
among themselves. Hence, it is spoken of as if it were 
a principle of motion entirely distinct from nature, and 
properly set in opposition to it. Names being commonly 
given to things, according to what is most obvious, and is 
suggested by what appears to the senses without reflec- 
tion and research. 

3. It must be observed, that in what has been ex- 
plained, as signiBed by the name of moral necessity, the 
word necessity is not used according to the original de- 
sign and meaning of the word : for, as was observed be- 
fore, such terms, necessary, impossible, irresistible, etc. 
in common speech, and their most proper sense, are al- 
ways relative ; having reference to some supposable vol- 
untary opposition or endeavour that is insufficient. JBut 
no such opposition, or contrary will and endeavour, is 
supposable in the case of moral necessity ; which is a cer- 
tainty of the inclination and will itself, which does not ad- 
mit of the supposition of a will to oppose and resist it. 
For it is absurd to suppose the same individual will to 
oppose itself in its present act, or the present choice to 
be opposite to and resisting present choice ; as absurd a^ 
it is to talk of two contrary motions in the same moving 



SECT. IT. or MOBAL INABILITY. 45 

body at the same time. And therefore the very case sup- 
posed never admits of any trial, whether an opposing or 
resisting will can overcome this necessity. 

What has been said of natural and moral necessity, may 
serve to explain what is intended by natural and moral ina- 
hility. We are said to be naturally unable to do a thing, 
when we cannot do it if we will, because what is commonly 
called nature does not allow of it, or because of some 
impeding defect or obstacle that is extrinsic to the will ; 
either in the faculty of understanding, constitution of body, 
or external objects. Moral inability consists not in any 
of these things; but either in the want of inclination, orl 
the strength of a contrary inclination, or the want of suffi- '. 
cient motives in view to induce and excite the act of the . 
will, or the strength of apparent motives to the contrary. 
Or both these may be resolved into one ; and it may be 
said in one word, that moral inability consists in the op* 
position or want of inclination. For when a person is 
unable to will or choose such a thing, through a defect 
of motives, or prevalence of contrary motives, it is the 
same thiirg as his being unable, through the want of an 
inclination, or the prevalence of a contrary inclination, in 
such circumstances, and under the influence of such views. 

To. give some instances of this moral inability. — A 
woman of great honor and chastity may have a moral in- 
ability to prostitute herself to her slave. A child of great 
love and duty to his parents may be unable to be willing 
to kill his father. A very lascivious man, in case of cer- 
tain opportunities and temptations, and in the absence of 
such and such restraints, may be unable to forbear grati- 
fying his lust. A drunkard, under such and such circum- 
stances, may be unable (o forbear taking of strong drink. 



46 OF MORAL INABILITY. PART I. 

A very malicious man may be unable to exert benevo- 
lent acts to an enemy, or to desire his prosperity : yea, 
some may be so under the power of a' vile disposition, that 
they may be unable to love those who are most worthy 
of their esteem and affection. A strong habit of virtue, 
and great degree of holiness, may cause a moral inability 
to love wickedness in general, may render a man unable 
to take complacence in wicked persons or things, or to 
choose a wicked life, and prefer it to a virtuous life. And, 
on the other hand, a great degree of habitual wickedness 
may lay a man under an inability to love and choose holi- 
ness, and render him utterly unable to love an in6nitely h<y% 
ly Being, or to choose and cleave to him as bis chief good. 

Here it may be of use to observe this distinction of 
moral inability, viz. of that which is general and habitur 
al, and that which is particular and occasional. By a 
j general and habitual moral inability, I mean an inability 
in the heart to all exercises or acts of will of that nature 
or kind, through a fixed and habitual inclination, or an 
habitual and stated defect, or want of a certain kind of in- 
clination. Thus, a very ill-natured man may be unable 
to exert such acts of benevolence, as another, who is full 
of good nature, commonly exerts; and a man, whose 
heart is habitually void of gratitude, may be unable to ex- 
ert such grateful acts, through that stated defect of a 
grateful inclination. By particular and occasional mor- 
al inability, I mean an inability of the will or heart to a 
particular act, through the strength or defect of present 
motives, or of inducements presented to the view of the 
understanding on this occasion. If it be so, that the will 
is always determined by the strongest motive, then it 
must always have an inability, in this latter sense, to act 



1 



SECT. XY. or MORAL INABILITY. 47 

Otherwise than it does ; it not being possible, in any case, 
that the will should at present go against the motive which 
has now, all things considered, the greatest strength and 
advantage to excite and induce it. The former of these 
kinds of moral inability, consisting in that which isstated, 
habitual, and general, is most commonly called by the 
name of inability ; because the word inability, in its 
most proper and original signification, has respect to some 
stated defect. And this especially obtains the name of 
inability also upon another account. I before observed, 
that the word inability, in its original and most common 
use, is a relative term ; and has respect to will and endea* 
vor, as supposable in the case, and as insufficient to bring 
to pass the thing desired and endeavored. Now, there 
may be more of an appearance and shadow of this, with 
respect to the acts which arise from a fixed and strong 
habit, than others that arise only from transient occasions 
and causes. Indeed, will and endeavor against, or di- 
verse from, present acts of the will, are in no case sup- 
posable, whether those acts be occasional or habitual ; for, 
that would be to suppose the will at present to be other- 
wise than at present it is. But yet there may be will 
and endeavour against yw^tire acts of the will, or volitions 
that are likely to take place, as viewed at a distance. It 
is no contradiction to suppose that the acts of the will at 
one time, may be against the will at another time ; and 
there may be desires and endeavours to prevent or 
excite future acts of the will ; but such desires and en- 
deavours are, in many cases, rendered insufficient and 
vain, through fixedness of habit ; when the occasion 
returns, the strength of habit overcomes and baffles 
all such opposition. In this respect, a man may be in 



48 OF MORAL IJNABIUTT. PAST I* 

miserable slavery and bondage to a strong habit. Bui 
it may be comparatively easy to make an .alteration with 
respect to such future acts, as are only occasional and 
transient ; because the occasion or transient cause, if fore- 
seen, may often easily be prevented or avoided. On 
this account, the moral inability that attends fixed habttSi 
especially obtains the name of inability. And then, as 
the will may remotely and indirectly resist itself, and do 
it in vain, in the case of strong habits, so reason may re- 
sist present acts of the will, and its resistance be insuffi- 
cient ; and this is more commonly the case also when the 
acts arise from strong habit. 

BiS^ it must be observed, concerning moral inability, in 
eacH^ina of it, that the word inabiliiy is used in a sense 
very diverse from its original import. The word signifies 
only a natural inability, in the proper use of it ; and is ap- 
plied to such cases only wherein a present will or incli- 
nation to the thing, with respect to which a person is said 
to be unable, is supposable. It cannot be truly said, ac- 
cording to the ordinary use of language, that a malicious 
man, let him be never so malicious, cannot hold his hand 
from striking, or that he is not able to shew his neigh- 
bor kindness ; or that a drunkard, let his appetite be never 
so strong, cannot keep the cup from his mouth. In the 
strictest propriety of speech, a man has a thing in his 
power, if he has it in his choice, or at his election ; and 
a man cannot be truly said to be unable to do a thing 
when he can do it if he will. It is improperly said, that 
a person cannot perform those external actions which are 
dependent on the act of the will, and which would be easily 
performed if the act of the will were present. And if it 
be improperly said, that he cannot perform those exter- 



SKCT. r. THS NOTIOK OF LIBBRTT, KTC. 49 

nal volantary actions which depend onr the will, it is in 
some respect more improperly said, that he is unable to 
exert the acts of the will tbeinselires; because it is more 
evidently false, with respect to these, that he cannot if he 
will : for to say so, is a downright contradiction : it is to 
say, he cannot will, if he does will. And in this case, not 
only is it true, that it is easy for a roan to do the thing if 
he will, but the very willing is. the doing ; when once he 
has willed, the thing is performed, and nothing else re* 
mains to be done. Therefore, in these things to ascribe 
a non-performance to the want of power or ability, is not 
just ; because the thing wanting is not a being able, but 
a being willing. There are faculties of mind and ca- 
pacity of nature, and everything else sufficient, but a dis- 
position: nothing is wanting but a will. 

SECTION V. 

CONCERNING THE NOTION OF LIBERTY AND OF MORAL AGENCY. 

The plain and obvious meaning of the words yrccrfom 
and liberty^ in common speech, is power, opportunity^ 
or advantage, that any one has to do as he pleases. Or, 
in other words, his being free from hinderance or impedi- 
ment in the way of doin^!:, or conducting, in any respect, 
as he wills.* And the contrary to liberty, whatever name 
we call that by, is a person's being hindered or unable to 
conduct as he will, or being necessitated to do otherwise. 

If this which I have mentioned be the meaning: of the 

* I say, not only doings but conducting; because a voluntary for- 
bearing to do, sitting still, keeping silence, etc. are instances of per 
sons* conduct, about which liberty is exercised ; thcrugh they are not 
«o properly called doing,

word liberty, in the ordinary use of language, as I trust 
that none that has ever learned to talk, and is unprejudiced, 
will deny ; then it will follow, that in propriety of speech, 
neither liberty, nor its contrary, can |)roperly be ascribed 
to any being or thing, but that which has such a faculty, 
power, or property, as is called will. For that which is 
possessed of no such thing as will, cannot have any j7otrer 
or opportunity of doing according to its will, nor be ne- 
cessitated to act contrary to its will, nor be restrained 
from acting agreeably to it. And therefore, to talk of 
liberty, or the contrary, as belonging to the very will itself, 
is not to speak good sense, if we judge of sense and non- 
sense by the original and proper signi6cation of words. 
For the will itself is not an agent that has a will; the 
power of choosing itself has not a power of choosing. 
That which has the power of volition or choice, is the 
man or the soul, and not the power of volition itself. And 
he that has the liberty of doing according to his will, is 
the agent or doer who is possessed of the will, and not 
the will which he is possessed of. We say with propriety, 
that a bird let loose has power and liberty to Qy ; but not 
that the bird's power of flying has a power and liberty 
of flying. To be free, is the property of an agent who 
is possessed of powers and faculties, as much as to be 
cunning, valiant, bountiful, or zealous. But these quali- 
ties are the properties of men or persons, and not the prop- 
erties of properties. 

There are two things that are contrary to this, which 
is called liberty in common speech. One is constraint; 
the same is otherwise called force, compulsion, and coac- 
Hon, which is a person's being necessitated to do a thing 
contrary to his will. The other is restraint ; which is 



AECT. v. and of moral AG£NCir. 51 

bis being hindered, and not having power to do according 
to his will. But that whicii has no will, cannot be the 
subject of these things. — I need say the less on this head, 
Mr. Locke having set the same tiling forth ^ith so great 
clearness in his '* Essay on the Human Understanding." 

But one ttimg more I would observe concerning what i 
is vulgarly called liberty ; namely, that power and oppor* \ 
tunity for one to do and conduct as he will, or according 
to his choice, is all that is meant by it ; without taking 
into the meaning of the word, anything of the cause or 
original of that choice, or at all considering bow the per- \ 
son came to have such a volition, whether it was caused 
by some external motive or internal habitual bias ; whether 
it was determined by some internal antecedent volition, 
or whether it happened without a cause ; whether it was 
necessarily connected with something foregoing, or not \ 
connected. Let the person come by his volition or ! 
choice how he will, yet, if he is able, and there is nothing i 
in the way to hinder his pursuing and executing his will, '' 
the man is fully and perfectly free, according to the pri- 
mary and common notion of freedom. 

What has been said may be sufficient to show what is 
meant by liberty^ according to the common notions of 
mankind, and in the usual and primary acceptation of the 
word : but the word, as used by Arminians, Pelagians, 
and others, who oppose the Calvinists, has an entirely 
different signification. These several things belong to 
their notion of liberty. 1 . That it consists in a sel/'de- 
termining power in the will, or a certain sovereignty the 
will has over itself, and its own acts, whereby it deter- 
mines its own volitions ; so as not to be dependent in its 
determinatjons on any cause without itself, nor determined 



I 



52 THE NOTION OF LIBERTY, PART I. 

by any thing prior to its own acts. 2. Indifference be- 
longs to liberty, in their notion of it, or that the mind, 
previous to the act of volition, be in equilibrio. 3. CoW' 
Hngence is another thing that belongs and is essential to 
it ; not in the common acceptation of the word, as that has 
been already explained, but as opposed to all necessity^ 
or any fixed and certain connection witli some previous 
ground or reason of its existence. They suppose the es- 
sence of liberty so much to consist in these things, that 
unless the will of man be free in this sense, he has no 
real freedom, how much soever he may be at liberty to 
act according to bis will. 

A moral agent is a being that is capable of tliose ac- 
tions that liave a moral quality, and which can properly 
be denominated good or evil in a moral sense, virtuous or 
vicious, commendable or faulty. To moral agency be- 
longs a moral Jaculiy, or sense of moral good and evil, or 
of such a thing as desert or worthiness, of praise or blame, 
reward or punishment ; and a capacity which an ageni 
has of being influenced in bis actions by moral induce- 
ments or motives, exhibited to the view of understanding 
and reason, to engage to a conduct agreeable to the mor- 
al faculty. 

The sun is very excellent and beneficial in its actiou 
and influence on the earth, in warming it, and causing it 
to bring forth its fruits ; but it is not a moral agent : its 
action, though good, is not virtuous or meritorious. Fire 
that breaks out in a city, and consumes great part of it, is 
very mischievous in its operation ; but is not a moral 
agent ; what it does is not faulty or sinful, or deserving 
of any punishment. The brute creatures are not moral 
agents : the actions of some of them are verv profitable 



SECT. v. AND OF MORAL AGENCY. S3 

and pleasant ; others are very hurtful : yet, seeing they 
have no moral faculty or sense of desert, and do not act 
froiii choice guided by understanding, or with a capacity 
of reasoning and reflecting, but only from instinct, and 
are not capable of being influenced by moral inducements, 
. their actiotis are not properly sinful or virtuous ; nor are 
they properly the subjects of any such moral treatment 
for what they do, as moral agents are for their faults or 
good deeds. 

Here it may be noted, that there is a cii'cumstantial 
difference between the moral agency of a ruler and a , 
subject. I call it circufosiandal, because it lies only in / 
the difference of moral inducements they are capable of 
being influenced by, arising from the diflTerence of circum- 
stances* A ruter acting in that capacity only, is not ca- 
pable of being influenced by a moral law, and its sanctions 
of tiireatenings and promises, rewards and punishments, as 
the subject is; though both may be influenced by a know- 
ledge of moral good and evil. And therefore the moral 
agency of the Supreme Bein^j;, who acts only in the ca- 
pacity of a ruler towards his creatures, and never as a sub- 
ject, differs in that respect from the moral agency of cre- 
ated intelligent beings. God's actions, and particularly 
those which he exerts as a moral governor, have moral 
qu^liflcations, are .morally good in the highest degree. 
They are most perfectly hojy and righteous ; and we must 
conceive of Him as influenced in the highest degree by 
that which, above all others, is properly a moral induce- 
ment ; viz. the moral good which He sees in such and 
such things; and therefore He is in the most proper 
sense, a moral agent, the source of all moral ability and 
agency, tlie^ fountain and rule of all virtue and moral

good ; though by reason of His being supreme over a?I, 
it is not possible He should be under the influence of law 
or command, promises or tbreatenings, rewards or pun- 
ishments, counsels or warnings. The essential qualities 
of a moral agent are in God in the greatest possible per- 
fection ; such as understanding, to perceive the differ- 
ence between moral good and evil ; a capacity of dis- 
cerning that moral worthiness and demerit by which 
some .things are praiseworthy, others deserving of Maine 
and punisiiment ; and also a capacity of choice, and 
choice guided by understanding, and a {wwer of acting ac- 
cording to his choice or pleasure, and being capable of 
doing those things which are in the highest sense praise- 
worthy. And herein does very much consist that image 
of God wherein he made man (which we read of. Gen. i. 
26, 27, and chap. ix. 6), by which God distinguished 
man from the beasts, viz. in those faculties and principles 
of nature whereby He is capable of moral agency. Here- 
in very much consists the natural image of God ; as his 
spiritual and moral image, wherein man was made at first, 
consisted in that moral excellency that he was endowed 
with. 



PART II. 

WHEREIN IT IS CONSIDERED, WHETHER THERE IS OR 
CAN BE ANT SUCH SORT OF FREEDOM OF WILL AS 
THAT WHEREIN ARMINIANS PLACE THE ESSENCE OF 
THE LIBERTY OF ALL MORAL AGENTS ; AND WHETHER 
ANT SUCH THING EVER WAS OR CAN BE CONCEITED OF. 

SECTION I. 

SHEWING THE MANIFEST INCONSISTENCE OFT HE ARMINTAN^NO- 
TION OF LIBERTY OF WILL CONSISTING IN THE WILLIS SELF- 
DETERMINING POWER. 

Having taken notice of those things which may be ne- 
cessary to be observed concerning the meaning of the 
principal terms and phrases made use of in controversies 
concerning human liberty, and particularly observed what 
liberty is according to the common language and general 
apprehension of mankind, and what it is as understood and 
maintained by Arminians ; I proceed to consider the Ar- 
minian notion of the freedom of the willy and the suppo- 
sed necessity of it in order to moral agency, or in order to 
any one's being capable of virtue or vice, and properly 
the subject of command or counsel, praise or blame j prom* 
ises or threatenings, rewards or punishments ; or whether 
that which has been described as the thing meant by lib- 
erty in common speech be not sufficient, and the only lib- 
erty which makes, or can make, any one a moral agent ; 
and so properly the subject of these things. In this Part 



56 THE INCONSISTENCE OF PART 11. 

I shall consider whether any such thing be possible or con- 
ceivable, as that freedom of will which Arminians insist 
on ; and shall inquire whether any such sort of liberty be 
necessary to moral agency, etc. in the next Part. 

And first of all I shall consider the notion of a self'de- 
termining power in the will ; wherein, according to the 
Arminians, does most essentially consist the will's free- 
dom ; and shall particularly inquire whether it be not 
plainly absurd, and a manifest inconsistence, to suppose 
that the will itself determines all the free acts of the 
will. 

Here I shall not insist on the great improppiety of such 
phrases, and ways of speakin;;, as the wV:'s determin- 
ing itself; because actions are to be ascribed to a«jents, 
and not properly to the powers of agents ; which impro- 
per way of speaking leads to many mistakes, and much 
confusion, as Mr. Locke observes. But I siiall suppose 
that the Arminians, when they speak of the will's deter- 
mining itself, do by the will mean the soid willing. I 
shall lake it for granted, that when they speak of the 
will, as the determiner, they mean the soul in the exercise 
of a power of willing, or acting voluntarily. I shall sup- 
pose this to be their meaning, because nothing else can 
be meant, without the grossest and plainest absurdity. 
In all cases wjien we speak of the powers or principles 
of acting, as doing such things, we mean that the agents 
which have these powers of acting do them in the exer- 
cise of those powers. So, when we say, valor fights 
courageously, we mean the man who is under the influx 
ence of valor fighis courageously. When we say, love 
seeks the object loved, we mean the person loving seeks 
that object. When we say, the understanding discerns, 



-r 



SBCT. I. SCLF-DCTERMINING POWKR. 57 

we meaa the soul in the exercise of that faculty. So, I 
when it is said, the will decides or determines^ the mean* 
ing must be, (hat the person in the^ exercise of a power 
of willing and choosing, or the soul acting voluntarily, de- j 
temiines. 

Therefore, if the will determines all its own free acts, 
the soul determines ail the free acts of the will, in the ex- 
ercise of a power of willing and choosing ; or, which is 
the same thing, it determines them of choice ; it deter^ 
mines its own acts by choosing its own acts.] If the will 
determines the will, then choice orders and determines the 
choice ; and acts of choice are subject to the decision, and 
follow the conduct, of other acts of choice .And therefore, 
if the will determines all its own free acts, then every free 
act of choice is determined by a preceding act of choice, 
choosing that act. And if that preceding act of the will or 
choice be also a free act, tiien, by these principles, in this 
act too, the \vill is self-determined ; ti>at is, this, in like 
manner, is an act that the soul voluntarily chooses ; or, 
which is the same thing, it is an act determined still by a 
preceding act of the will choosing that. And the like may 
again be observed of the last-mentioned act. Which brings 
us directly to a contradiction ; for it supposes an act of the 
will preceding the first act in the whole train, directing 
and determining the rest ; or a free act of the will, before 
the first free act of the will. Or else we must come at 
last to an act of the will, determining the consequent acts, 
wherein the will is not self-determined, and so is not a 
free act, in this notion of freedom ; but if the first act in 
the train, determining and fixing the rest, be not free, 
none of them all can be free; as is manifest at first view, 
but shall be demonstrated presently.

fHE INCONSISTENCE OF 



FARt. tt. 



If the will, which we find governs the members of the 
/body, and determines and commands their motions and 
/- / actions, does also govern itself, and determine Its own 
^^ ' motions and actions, it floubtless determines them the same 
*. way, even by antecedent volitions. The will determines 
which way the hands and feet shall move, by an act of 
volition or choice ; and there is no other way of^the will's 
determining, directing, or commanding anything at alL 
Whatsoever the will commands, it commands by an act of 
the will. And if it has itself under its command, and de* 
termines itself in its own actions, it doubtless does it the 
same way that it determines other things which are under 
its command : so that if the freedom of the will consists 
in this, that it has itself and its own actions under its com- 
mand and direction, and its own volitions are determined 
by itself, it will follow, that every free volition arises from 
another antecedent volition, directing and commanding 
that : and if that directing volition be ako free, in that 
also the will is determined ; that is to say, that directing 
volition is determined by another going before that, and 
so en, till we come to the first volition in the whole se- 
ries : and if that first volition be free, and the will self-de- 
termined in it, then that is determined by another voli- 
tion preceding that. Which is a contradiction ; becaus% 
by the supposition, it can have none before it, to dir^Vl 
or determine it, being the first in the train. But if that 
first volition is not determined by any preceding act of 
the will, then that act is not determined by the will, and 
so is not free in the Arminian notion of freedom, which 
consists in the will's self-determination. And if that first 
act of the will, which determines and fixes the subsequent 
acts, be not free, non^ of the following acts, which are 




SeCT. 1. SELF-DETERMtNlNG POWER. 59 

determined by it, can be free. If we suppose there are 
fi^e acts in the train, the Gfth and last determined by the 
fourth, and the fourth by the third, the third by the sec- 
ond, and the second by the first ;' if the first is not deter- 
mined by the will, and so not free, then none of them are 
truly determined by the will : that is, that each of them 
are as they are, and not otherwise, is hot first owing to 
the will, but to the determination of the first in the series, 
which is not dependent on the will, and is that which the 
will has no hand in the determination of. And this being 
that which decides what the rest shall be, and determines 
their existence ; therefore tlie first determination of their 
existence is not from the will. J The case is just the same, 
if, instead of a chain of five acts of the will, we should 
suppose a succession of ten, or a hundred, or ten thousand. 
If the first act be not free, being determined by some- 
thing out of the will, and this determines the next to be 
agreeable to itself, and that the next, and so on ; they 
are none of them free, but all originally depend on, and 
are determined by some cause out of the will : and so all 
freedom in the case is excluded, and no act of the will 
can be free, according to this notion of freedom. If we 
should suppose a long chain often thousand links, so con- 
nected that if the first link moves it will move the next, 
/ and that the next ; and so the whole chain must be de- 
termined to motion, and in the direction of its motion, by 
the motion of the first link ; and that is moved by some^ 
thing else : in this case, though all the links but one are 
moved by other parts of the same chain, yet it appears 
/ that the motion of no one, nor the direction of its motion, 
is from any self-moving or self determining power in the 
chain, any more than if every link were immediately 



60 SUPPOSED EVASIONS CONSIDEBEB. PART II. 

moved by something that did not belong to the chain. If 
the will be not free in the first act, which causes the next, 
then neither is it free in the next, which is caused by that 
first act : for though, indeed, the will caused it, yet it did 
not cause it freely ; because the preceding act, by which 
it was caused was not free. And again, if the will be not 
free in the second act, so neither can it be in the third, 
which is caused by that ; because, in like manner, that 
third was determined by an act of the will that was not^ 
free. And so we may go on to the next act, and from 
that to the next ; and how long soever the succession of 
acts is, it is all one ; if the first on which the whole chain 
depends, and which determines all the rest, be not a free 
act,* the will is not free in causing or determining ajiy one 
of those acts ; because the act by which it determines 
them all is not a free act, and therefore the will is no 
more free in determining them than if it did not cause them 
at all. Thus, this Arminian notion of liberty of the will, 
consisting in the will's self-determination, is repugnant to 
itself, and shuts itself wholly out of the world. 

SECTION II. 

SEVERAL SUPPOSED WAYS OF EVADING THE FOBEGOING 

REASONING, CONSIDERED. 

If, to evade the force of what has been observed, it 
should be said, that when the Arminians speak of the 
will's determining its own acts, they do not mean that th6 
will determines its acts by any preceding act, or that one 
act of the will determines another ; but only that the 
faculty or power of will, or the soul in the use of that 
power, determines its own volitions ; and that it does it 



8CCT. II. SUPPOSED EVASIONS CONSIDERED. 61 

without any act going before the act determined : such 
an evasion would be full of the most gross absurdity. I 
confess it is an evasion of my own inventing ; and I do 
not know but I should wrong the Arminians in supposing 
that any of them would make use of it. But it being as 
good a one as I can invent, I would observe upon it a few 
things. 

Firsts If the faculty or power of the will determines an 
act of volition, or the soul in the use or exercise of that 
power determines it, that is the same thing as for the soul 
to determine volition by an act of will. For an exercist 
of the power of will, and an act of that power, are the 
same thing. Therefore, to say that the power of will, 
or the soul in the use or exercise of that power, determines 
volition, without an act of will preceding the vojitbn de- 
termined, is a contradiction. 

Secondly^ If a power of will determines the act of 
the will, then a power of choosing determines it. For, 
as was before observed, in every act of .will, there is 
choice ; and a power* of willing is a power of choosing. 
But if a power of choosing determines the act of volition, 
it determines it by choosing it. For it is most absurd to. 
say that a power of choosing determines one thing rather 
than another, without choosing anything. But if a pow- 
er of choosing determines volition by choosing it, then here 
is the act of volition determined by an antecedent choice, 
choosing that volition. 

Thirdly, To say, the faculty, or the soul, determines 
its own volition, but not by any act, is a contradiction. 
Because for the soul to direct, decide or determine any 
thing, is to act ; and this is supposed ; for the soul is 
here spoken of as being a cause in this a£fair, bringing 

6 



62 SUPPOSED EVASIONS CONSIDERED. PART U, 

something to pass, or doing something ; or, which is 
the same thing, exerting itself in oi-der to an effect, 
which effect is the determination of volition, or the par- 
ticular kind and manner of an act of will. But certainly, 
this exertion or action is not the same with the effect, in 
order to the production of which it is exerted ; but must 
be something prior to it. 

• Again, The advocates for this notion of the freedom 
of the will speak of a certain sovereignty in the will, 
whereby it has power to determine its own volitions. 
And therefore the determination of volition must itself be 
an act of the will ; for, otherwise, it can be no exercise of 
that supposed power and sovereignty. 

Again, If the will determines itself, then either the will 
is active in determining its volitions, or it is not. If it bo 
active in it, then the determination is an act of the will ; 
and so there is one act of the will determining another. 
But if the will is not active in the determination, then how 
does it exercise any liberty in it ? These gentlemen sup- 
pose, that the thing wherein the will exercises liberty, is 
jn its determining its own acts. But how can this be, if 
it be not active in determining ? Certainly the will, or 
the soul, cannot exercise any liberty in tliat wherein it 
doth not act, or wherein it doth not exercise itself. So 
that if either part of this dilemma be taken, this scheme 
of liberty, consisting in self-determining power, is over- 
thrown. If there be an act of the will in determining all 
its own free acts, then one free act of the will is deter- 
mined by another ; and so we have the absurdity of every 
free act, even the very first, determined by a foregoing free 
act. But if there be no act or exercise of the will in de- 
termining its own acts, then no liberty is exercised in de- 



r 



8CCT. II. SUPPOSED EVASIONS CONSIDERED. 63 

termining them. From whence it follows, that no libertj 
consists in the wilj's power to determine its own acts ; or^ 
which is the same thing, that there is no such thing as 
liberty consisting in a self-determining power of the will. 

If it should be said, that altliough it be true, if the 
soul determines its own volitions, it must be active in so 
doing, and the determination itself must be an act ; yet 
there is no need of supposing this act to be prior to the 
volition determined : but the will or soul determines the 
act of the will in willing; it determines its own volition, 
in the very act of volition ; it directs and limits the act of 
the will, causing it to be so and not otherwise, in exerting 
the act, without any preceding act to exert that. If any 
should say after this manner, they must mean one of these 
three things: either (I) that the determining act, though 
it be before the act determined in the order of nature, yet 
is not before it in order of time. Or, (2) that the deter- 
mining act is not before the act determined, either in the 
ord^ of time or nature, nor is truly distinct from it ; but 
that the soul's determining the act of volition is the same 
thing with its exerting the act of volition : the mind^s ex- 
erting such a particular act, is its causing and determining 
the act. Or, (3) that volition has no cause, and is no 
effect ; but comes into existence, with such a particular 
determination, without any ground or reason of its exis- 
tence and determination. — I shall consider these distinctly. 

1. If all that is meant be^ that the determining act is 
not before the act determined in order of time, it will not 
help the case at all, though it should be allowed. If it be 
before the determined act in the order of nature^ being 
the cause or ground of its existence, this as much proves it 
to be distinct from it and independent on it, as if it were 



64 SUPPOSED EVASIOIf S CONSIDERED. PART II. 

before in the order of time. As the cause of the partica- 
for motion of a natural body, in a certain direction, may' 
have no distance as to time, yet cannot be the same with 
the motion effected by it, but must be as distinct from it 
as any other cause that is before its effect in the order of 
time : as the architect is distinct from the houste which he 
builds, or the father distinct from the son which he begets. 
And if the act of the will determining be distinct from 
the act deternnined, and before it in the order of nature, 
then we can go back from one to another, until we come 
to the first in the series, which has no act of the will be- 
fore it in the order of nature, determining it ; and conse- 
quently is an act not determined by the will, and so not 
II free act, in this notion of freedom. And this being the 
act which determines all. the rest, none of them are free 
sets. As, when there is a chain of many links, the first of 
which only is taken hold of and drawn by hand ; all the 
rest may follow and be moved at the same instant, with- 
out any distance of time ; but yet the motion of one link 
is before that of another in the order of nature ; the last Is 
rafoved by the next, and that by the next, and so till we 
come to the first ; which not being moved by any other, 
but by something distinct from the whole chain, this as 
much proves that no part is moved by any self-moving 
power in the chain, as if the motion of one link followed 
that of another in the order of time. 

2. If any should s$iy, that the determining act is not 
before the determined act, either in the order of time or 
of nature, nor is distinct from it ; but that the exertion of 
the act is the determination of the act ; that for the soul 
to exert a particular volition, is for it to cause and deter- 
mine that act of volition : I would on this observe, that 



SECT. II. SUPPOSED EVASIONS COigSIDEllEB. 65 

the thing in question seems to he forgotten, or kept out of , 
sight, in a darkness and unintelligibleness of speech ; un- 
less such an objector would mean to contradict himself.-— 
The very act of volition itself is doubtless a determination 
of mind ; f. 6. it is the mind's drawing up a conclusion, or 
coming to a choice between two things, or more, propo- 
sed to it. But determining among external objects of 
choice is not the same with determining the act of choice 
itself, among various possible acts of choice. — The ques- 
tion is, What influences, directs, or determines the mind 
or will to come to such a conclusion or choice as it does ? 
Or what is the cause, ground, or reason, why it concludes 
thus, and not otherwise ? Now it must be answered, ac- 
cording to the Arminian notion of freedom, that the will 
influences, orders, and determines itself thus to act. And 
if it does, I say it must be by some antecedent act. To 
say it is caused, influenced, and determined by something, 
and yet not determiiied by any thing antecedent, either 
in order of time or nature, is a contradiction. For that is 
what is meant by a thing's being prior in the order of na- 
ture, that it is some way the cause or reason of the thing 
with respect to which it is said to be prior. 

If the particular act or exertion of will, which comes 
into existence, be anything properly determined at all, 
then it has some cause of its existing, and of its existing 
in such a particular determinate manner, and not another ; 
some cause, whose influence decides the matter; which 
cause is distinct from the effect, and prior to it. But to 
say, that the will or mind orders, influences, and deter- 
mines itself to exert such an act as it does, by the very 
exertion itself, is to make the exertion both cause and ef- 
fect ; or the exerting such an act, to be a cause of the 

6* 



66 SUPPOSED EVASIONS CONSIDERED. PART II, 

exertion of such an act. For the question is, What is 
the cause and reason of the soul's exerting such an act ? 
To which the answer is ; The soul exerts such an act ; 
and that is the cause of it. And so, by this^ the exertion 
must be prior in the order of nature to itself, and distinct 
from itself. 

3. If the meaning be, that the soul's exertion of such 
a particular act of will is a thing that comes to pass ofiU 
self, without any cause ; and that there is absolutely no 
ground or reason of the soul's being determined to exert 
such a volition, and make such a choice, rather than 
another ; t say, if this be the meaning of Anninians, 
when they contend so earnestly for the will's determin- 
ing its own acts, and for liberty of will consisting in self- 
determining power ; they do nothing but confound them- 
selves and others with words without a meaninrj. In the 
question. What determines the willl and in their answer^j 
that the will determines itself y and in all the dispute ab6ut 
it, it seems to be taken for granted, that something deter- 
mines the will ; and the controversy on this head is not, 
whether anything at all determines it, or whether its de- 
termination has any cause or foundation at all; hat -whe^. 
the foundation of it is, whether in the will itself, or some*'' 
where else. But if the thing intended be what is above 
mentioned, then all comes to this, that nothing at all de- 
termines the will ; volition having absolutely no cause or 
foundation of its existence, either within or without. There 
is a great noise made about self-determining power, as thfe 
source of all free acts of the will ; but when the inaitteV 
comes to be explained, the meaning is, that no power at 
all is the source of these acts, neither self-determining, 
power, nor any other, but they arise from nothing ; no 



SeCT. UI. NO £VENT WITHOUT A ClUSE. 67 

cause, DO power, no influence, being at all concerned in 
the matter. 

However, this very thing, even that the free acts of 
the will are events which come to pass without a cause, 
is certainly implied in the Arminian notion of liberty of 
will; though it be very inconsistent with many other 
things in their scheme, and repugnant to some things im* 
plied in their notion of liberty. Their opinion implies, 
that the particular determination of volition is without 
any cause; because they hold the free acts of the will to 
be contingent events ; and contingence is essential to free- 
dom, in their notion of it. But certainly, those things 
which have a prior ground and reason of their particular 
existence, a cause which antecedently determines them 
to be, and determines them to be just as they are, do not 
happen contingently. If something foregoing, by a cau* 
sal influence and connection, determines and fixes precise- 
ly their coming to pass, and the manner of it, then it does 
not remain a contingent thing whether they shall come to 
pass or no. 

And because it is a question in many respects very im- 
portant, in this controversy about the freedom of will, 
whether the free acts of the will are events which come 
to pass without a came ; 1 shall be particular in examin- 
ing this point in the two following sections. 

SECTION in. 

WHETHER ANY EVENT WHATSOEVER, AND VOLITION IN PARTI- 
CULAR, CAN COMB TO PASS WITHOUT A CAUSE OF ITS EXIST- 
SNCE. 

Before I enter on any argument on this subject, I 
would explain how I would be understood, when I use 



68 NO EVENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PAftT It. 

the word cause ia this discourse ; since, for want of a 
better word, I shall have occasion to use it in a sense 
which is more extensive than that in which it is some- 
times used. The word is often used in so restrained v 
sense as to signify only that which has a positive effidenr 
cy or influence to produce a thing, or brir>g it to pass. 
But there are many things which have no such positive 
productive influence, which yet are causes in that retspect, 
that they have truly the nature of a ground or reason why 
some things are, rather than others ; or why they are as 
they are, rather than otherwise. Thus, the absence of 
the sun in the night is not the cause of the falling^of the 
dew at that time, in the same manner as its beams are 
the cause ^of the ascending of the vapors in the day- 
time ; and its withdrawment in the winter is not in the 

' same manner the cause of the freezing of the waters, as 
its approach in the spring is the cause of their thawing. 
But yet the withdrawment or absence of the sun is an an- 
tecedent, with which these efiects in the night and winter 
are connected, and on which they depend ; and is ott« 
thing that belongs to the ground and reason why they 
come to pass at that time rather than at other times; 
though the absence of the sun is nothing positive^ nor has 
any positive iafluence. 

It may be further observed, that when I speak of con* 
nection of causes and effects, I have respect to moral cau- 

^pes, as well as those that are called natural in distinction 
from them. Moral causes may be causes in as proper a 
sense as any causes whatsoever ; may have as real an in- 
fluence, and may as truly be the ground and reason of an 
event's coming to pass. 

Therefore I sometimes use the word cause, in this in- 



SECT. III. NO EVENT WITHOUT A CATTSE. 69 

• 

qniry to signify any antecedeniy either natural or moral, 
positive or negative, on which an event, either a thing, 
or the manner and circumstance of a thing, so depends, 
that it is the ground and reason, either in whole or in 
part, why it is, rather than not ; or why it is as it is, ra* 
ther than otherwise ; or, in other words, any antecedent 
with which a consequent event is so connected, that it 
truly belongs to the reason why the proposition which af- . 
firms that event is true, whether it has any positive influ- 
ence or not. And in an agreeableness to this, I sometimes 
use the word effect for the consequence of another thing, 
which is, perhaps, rather an occasion than a cause, most 
properly speaking. 

I am the more careful thus to explain my meaning, 
that I may cut off occasion from any that might seek oc- 
casion to cavil and object against some things which I 
may say concerning the dependence of all things which 
come to pass on some cause, and their connection with 
their cause. 

Having thus explained what I mean by cause, I assert,/ 
that nothing ever comes to pass without a cause. What^ 
is self-existent, roust be from eternity, and must be un-j 
changeable ; but as to all things that begin to be, they ar^ 
not self-existent, and therefore must have some foundatio^ 
of their existence without themselves. — That whatsoeve^^ ^ 
begins to be, which before was not, must have a causcif 
why it then begins to exist, seems to be the first dictatej 
of the common and natural sense which God hath implant, 
ted in the minds of all mankind, and the main foundation \ 
of all our reasonings /about the existence of things past)^ 
present, or to come. 

And this dictate of common sense equally respects sub* 



^ 



70 NO EVENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PART H* 

Stances and modes, or things and the manner and circum- 
stances of things. Thus, if we see a body which has 
hitherto been dt rest, start out of a state of rest, and be* 
gin to move, we do as naturally and necessarily suppose 
there is some cause or reason of this new mode of exis- 
tence, as of the existence of a body itself which had hith- 
erto not existed. And so, if a body, which had hitherto 
moved in a certain direction, should suddenly change the 
direction of its motion ; or if it should put off its old figure, 
and take a new one ; or change its color : the beginning 
of these new modes is a new event, and the mind of man- 
kind necessarily supposes that there is some cause or rea- 
son of them. 

If this grand principle of common sense be taken ,away, 
all arguing from effects to causes ceaseth, and so all know- 
ledge of any existence, besides what we have by the most 
direct and immediate intuition. Particularly all our proof 
of the being of God ceases : we argue his being from our 
own being, and the being of other things, which we are 
sensible once were not, but have begun to be ; and from 
the being of the world, with all its constituent parts, and 
the manner of their existence; all which we see plainly 
are not necessary in their own nature, and so not self-ex- 
istent, and therefore must have a cause. But if things, 
not in themselves necessary, may begin to be without a 
cause, all this arguing is vain. 

Indeed, I will not affirm, that there is in the nature of 
things no foundation for the knowledge of the being of 
God, without any evidence of it from his works. I do 
suppose there is a great absurdity, in the nature of thirigs 
simply considered, in supposing that there should be no 
God, or in denying being in general, and supposing an 



8KCT. III. NO £tri!NT WITHOUT A CAUSE. 71 

eternal, absolute, universal nothing: and therefore thai 
here would be foundation of intuitive evidence that it can- 
not be, and that eternal, infinite, most perfect Being must 
be; if we had strength and comprehension of mind suffi* 
cient to hare a clear idea of general and universal being, 
or, which is the same thing, of the infinite, eternal, most 
perfect Divine nature and essence. But then we should 
not properly come to the knowledge of the being of God 
by arguing ; but our evidence would be intuitive : we 
should see it, as we see other things that are necessary in 
themselves, the contraries of which are in their own na- 
ture absurd and contradictory ; as we see that twice two 
is four ; and as we see that a circle has no angles. If Ave 
had as clear an idea of universal, infinite entity, as we 
have of these other things, I suppose we should most in- 
tuitively see the absurdity of supposing such being not to 
be ; should immediately see there is no room for the ques- 
tion, whether it is possible that being, in the most general 
abstracted notion of it, should not be. But we have not 
that strength and extent of mind, to know this certainly 
in this intuitive independent manner : but the way that 
mankind come to the knowledge of the being of God, is 
that which the apostle speaks of, Rom. i. 20, "The in- 
visible things of him, from the creation of the world, are 
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made ; 
even his eternal power and Godhead." Vfe first ascend^ 
and prove a posfbriori, or from effects, that there must 
be an eternal cause ; and then, secondly,' prove by argu- 
mentation, not intuition, that this being must be necessa- i 
rily existent; and then, thirdly^ from the proved neces-j 
sity of his existence, we may descend and prove many of/ 
his perfections a priori. 



73 NO EVENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PART lU ^ 

But if once this grand principle of common sense be 
given up, that what is not necessary in itself, must have 
a cause ; and we begin to maintain, that things may come 
into existence, and begin to be, which heretofore have not 
been, of themselves, without any cause ; ail our means 
of ascending in our arguing from the creature to the Crea- 
tor, and all our evidence of the being of God, is cut off 
at one blow. In this case, we cannot prove that there is 
a God, either from the being of the world and the crea- 
tures in it, or from the manner of their being, their order, 
beauty, and use. For if things may come into existence 
without any cause at all, then they doubtless may without 
any cause answerable to the effect. Our minds do alike 
naturally suppose and determine both these things ; name- 
ly, that what begins to be has a cause, and also that it 
has a cause proportionable and agreeable to the effect* 
The same principle which leads us to determine, that 
there cannot be anything coming to pass without a 
cause, leads us to determine that there cannot be more 
in the effect than in the cause. 

Yea, if once it should be allowed, that things may come 
to pass without a cause, we should not only have no proof 
of the being of God, but we should be without evidence 
of the existence of anything whatsoever, but our own 
immediately present ideas and consciousness. For we 
haVe no way to prove anything else, but by arguing from 
effects to causes : from the ideas now immediately in view, 
we argue other things not immediately in view : from 
sensations now excited in us, we infer the existence of 
things without us, as the causes of these sensations : and 
from the existence of these things, we argue other things, 
which they depend on, as effects on causes. We infer 



SECT. 111. NO EYENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. 73 

the past existence*of ourselves, or anything else, by memo- 
ry ; only as we argue, that the ideas which are now in 
our minds, are the consequences of past ideas and sensa- 
tions. We immediately perceive nothing else but the 
ideas wiiich are this moment extant in ourminds. We 
perceive or know other things only by means of these, as 
necessarily connected with others, and dependent on them. 
But if things may be without causes, all this necessary 
connection and dependence is dissolved, and so all means 
of our knowledge is gone. If there be no absurdity or 
difficulty in supposing one thing to start out of non-exist- 
ence into being of itself without a cause, then there is no 
absurdity or difficulty in supposing the same of millions 
of millions. For nothing, or no difficulty multiplied, still 
is nothing, or no difficulty : nothing multiplied by nothing 
does not increase the sum. 

And indeed, according to the hypothesis I am oppo- 
sing, of the acts of the will coming to pass without fi 
cause, it is the case in fact, that millions of millions of 
events are continually coining into existence contingently, 
without any cause or reason why they do so, all over the 
world, every day and hour, through all ages. So it is, 
in a constant succession, in every moral agent. This 
contingency, this efficient nothing, this elTectual no-cause; 
is always ready at hand to produce this sort of effiicts, as 
long as the agent exists, and as often as he has occ:\;yion. 

If it were so, that things only of one kind, viz. "acts of 
the will, seemed to come to pass of themselves, but those 
of this sort in general came into being thus ; and it wer« 
an event that was continual, and that happened in a course, 
wherever were capable subjects of such events ; this very 

7 



74 NO ETENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PART II. 

thing would demonstrate that there was some cause of 
them, which made such a difference between this event 
and others, and that they did not really liappen contin- 
gently. For contingence is blind, and does not pick and 
choose for a particular sort of efvents. Nothing has no 
choice. /This no-cause, which causes no existence, can- 
not cause the existence which comes to pass to be of one 
particular sort only, distinguished from all others. Thus, 
that only one sort of matter drops out of the heavens, even 
water, and that this comes so often, so constantly and 
plentifully, all over the world, in all ages, shows that there 
is some cause or reason of the falling of water out of the 
heavens ; and that something besides mere contingence 
has a hand in the matter. 

If we should suppose nonentity to be about to bring 
forth ; and things were coming into existence without 
any cause or antecedent, on which the existence, or kind 
or manner of existence, depends ; or which could at all 
determine whether the things should be stones, or stars, or 
beasts, or angels, or human bodies, or souls, or only some 
new motion or figure in natural bodies, or some new sen- 
sations in animals, or new ideas in the human understand- 
ing, or new volitions in the will ; or anything else of all 
the infinite number of possibles ; then certainly it would 
not be expected, although many millions of millions of 
things are coming into existence in this manner, all over * 
the face of the earth, that they should all be only one 
particular kind, and that it should be thus in all ages, and 
that this sort of existences should never fail to come to 
pass where there is room for them, or a subject capable of 
them, and that constantly, whenever there is occasion for 
them. 



SXCT. III. NO EVENT WITHOUT A CAUSE. 75 

If any should imagine, there is something in the sort 
of event that renders it possible for it to come into exist- 
ence without a cause, and should say, that the free acts 
of the will are existences of an exceeding different nature 
fronii other things ; by reason of which they may come 
into existence without any previous ground or reason of it, 
though other things cannot ; if they make this objection 
in good earnest, it would be an evidence of their strange- 
ly forgetting themselves ; for they would be giving an ac- 
count of some ground of the existence of a thing, when at 
the same time they would maintain there is no ground of its 
existence. Therefore I would observe, that the particular 
nature of existence, be it never so diverse from others, 
can lay no foundation for that thing's coming into exist- 
ence without a cause ; because to suppose this, would be 
to suppose the particular nature of existence to be a thing 
prior to the existence ; and^o a thing which makes way 
for existence, with such a circumstance, namely, without 
a cause or reason of existence. But that which in any 
respect makes way for a thing's coming into being, or for 
any manner or circumstance of its first existence, must 
be prior to the existence. The distinguished nature of 
^he effect, which is something belonging to the effect, 
cannot have influence backward, to act before it is. The 
peculiar nature of that thing called volition, can do noth- 
ing, can have no influence, while it is not. ' And after- 
wards it is too late for its influence ; for then the thing 
has made sure of existence already, without its help. 

So that it is indeed as repugnant to reason to suppose 
that an act of the will should come into existence with- 
out a cause, as to suppose the human soul, or an angel, or 
the globe of the earth, or the whole universe, should 



76 VOLITION NOT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PART II. 

come into existence without a cause. And if once we 
allow that such a sort of effect as a volition may come to 
pass without a cause, how do we know but that many 
other sorts of effects may do so too ? It is not the parti- 
cular kind of effect that makes the absurdity of supposing 
it has being without a cause, but something wliicb is com- 
mon to all things that ever begin to be, viz. that they are 
not self-existent, or necessary in the nature of things. 

SECTION IV. 

WHETHER VOLITION CAN ABISE WITHOUT A CAUSE, THROUGH 
THE ACTIVITY OF THE NATURE OF THE SOUL. 

The author of the " Essay on the Freedom of the Will 
m God and the Creatures," in answer to that objectioo 
against his doctrine of a self-determimng power in the will 
(p. 68, 69), That nothing is, or comes to pass, without 
a sirfflcient reason why it isy and why it is in this man-^^ 
ner rather than another, allows that it is thus in corporeal *: ^ 
things, which are, properly and philosophically speaJcingy '' ) 
passive being; but denies that it is thus in spirits, which 
are beings of an active nature, who have the spring of 
action within themselves, and can determine themselves. 
By which it is plainly supposed, that such an eyent as an 
act of the will may come to pass in a spirit, without a 
sufficient reason why it comes to pass, or why it is after 
this manner rather than another, by reason of the activity 
of the nature of a spirit. But certainly this author, in this 
matter, must be very unwary and inadvertent. For, 

1. The objection or difficulty proposed by this author 
seems to be forgotten in his answer or solution. The 
very difficulty, as he himself proposes it, is this : how an 



SCCT. IV. VOLITION NOT WITHOUT A CAUSE. 77 

event can come to pass wiihmU a sufficient reason why ii 
is^ or why it is in this manner rather than another 7 In* 
stead of solving this difficulty, or answering this question 
with regard to volition, as he proposes, he forgets himself, 
and answers another question quite diverse, and wholly 
inconsistent with this, viz. What is a sufficient reason 
why it is, and why it is in this manner rather than another ? 
And he assigns the active being's own determination as 
the cause, and a cause sufficient for the effect ; and leaves 
all the difficulty unresolved, and the question unanswered, 
which yet returns, even. How the soul's own determina-^ 
tion, which he speaks of, c^me to exist, and to be what 
it was, without a cause ? \The activity of the soul may 
enable it to be the cause of effects ; but it does not at all 
enable or help it to be the subject of effects which have 
no cause, which is the thing this author supposes concenv- 
ing acts of the will^X Activity of nature will no more en- 
able a being to proauce effects, and determine the man- 
ner of their existence, within itself, without a cause, than 
otU o/* itself, in some other being. But if an active being 
should, through its activity, produce and determine an 
effect in some external object, how absurd would it be to 
say that the effect was produced without a cause ! 

2. The question is not so much, How a spirit endowed 
with activity comes to act, as, Why it exerts such an act 
and not another: or why it acts with such a particular 
determination. If activity of nature be the cause why a 
spirit (the soul of man, for instance,) acts, and does not 
lie still, yet that alone is not the cause why its action is 
thus and thus limited, directed, and determined. Active 
nature is a general thing; it is an ability or tendency of 
nature to action, generally taken, which may be a cause 

'7* 



78 VOLITION NOT WITHOUT i. CAUSE. PART II. 

why the soul acts as occasion or reason is given ; but this 
alone cannot be a sufficient cause why the soul exerts 
such a particular act, at such a time, rather than others. 
In order to this, there must be something besides a gen- 
eral tendency to action ; there must also be a particular 
tendency to that individual action. If it should be asked, 
why the sou) of man uses its activity in such a manner 
as it does ; and it should be answered, that the soul uses 
its activity thus rather than otherwise, because it has ac- 
tivity, would such an answer satisfy a rational man? 
Would it not rather be looked upon as a very impertinent 
one ? 

3. An active being can bring no efiects to pass by his 
activityHbut what are consequent upon his acting; he pro- 
duces nothing by his activity, any other way than by the 
exercise of his activity, and so nothing but the fruits of its 
exercise ; he brings nothing to pass by a dormant activity. 
But the exercise of his activity is action ; and so his ac* 
tion or exercise of his activity, must be prior to the ef- 
fects of his activity. If an active being produces an ef- 
fect in another being, about which his activity is conver- 
sant, the effect being the fruit of bis activity, his activity 
must be first exercised or exerted, and the effect of it 
must follow. So it must be, with equal reason, if the ac- 
tive being is his own object, and his activity is conversant 
about himself, to produce and determine some effect in 
himself; still the exercise of his activity must go* before 
the effect, which he brings to pass and determines by it. 
And therefore his activity cannot be the cause of the deter- 
mination of the first action, or exercise of activity itself, 
whence the effects of activity arise ; for that would imply' 
a contradiction ; it would be to say, the first exercise of ac- 



iitCt.tt. VOLITION NOT WITHOUT A CAUSE. 7d 

tivity is before the first exercise of activity, and is the 
cause of it. 

4. That the soul, though an active substance, cannot 
diversify its own acts, but by first acting ; or be a deter-* 
mining cause of different acts, or any dififerent effects, 
sometimes of one kind and sometimes of another, any otb<» 
er way than in consequence of its own diverse acts, is man- 
ifest by this : that if so, then the 'same cause, the sapu 
causal power, force, or influence, without variation in any 
respect, would produce different effects at different times. 
For the same substance of the soul before it acts, and the 
same active nature of the soul before it is exerted (t. e. 
before in the order of natute) would be the cause of dif- 
ferent effects, viz. different volitions at different times. 
But the substance of the soul before it acts, apd its ac- 
tive nature before it is exerted, are the same without vari- 
ation. For it is some act that makes the first variation iti 
the cause, as to any causal exertion, force, or influence. 
But if it be so that the soul has no different causality, or 
diverse causal force or influence in producing these di- 
verse effects ; then it is evident that the soul has no influ- 
ence, no hand in the diversity of the effect, and that the 
difference of the effect cannot be owing to anything in the 
soul ; or, which is the same thing,'the soul does not de- 
termine the diversity of the effect ; which is contrary to 
the supposition. It is true the substance of the soul be- ^ 
fore it acts, and before there is any difference in that re- 
spect, may be in a different state and circumstances : but 
those whom I oppose will not allow the different circum- 
stances of the soul to be the determining causes of the acts 
of the will, as being contrary to their notion of self-deter- 
mination and self-motion. 



60 VOLITION NOT WITHOUT A CAUSE. PABT. II* 

5. Let us suppose, as these divines do, that there are 
DO acts of the soul, strictly speaking, but free volitions ; 
then it will follow, that the soul is an active being in noth- 
ing further than it is a voluntary or elective being ; and 
whenever it produces effects actively, it produces effects 
voluntarily and electively. But to produce effects thus 
is the same thing as to produce effects in consequence ofy 
and according io^ its own choice. And if so, then sure- 
ly the soul does not by its activity produce all its own acts 
of will or choice themselves ; for this, by the supposition, 
is to produce all its free acts of choice voluntarily and elec* 
tively, or in consequence of its own free acts of choice, 
which brings the matter directly to the fore-mentioned 
contradiction, or of a free act of choice before the first free 
act of choice. According to these gentlemen's own notion 
of action, if there arises in the mind avolitioi;), without a 
free act of the will or choice to determine and produce it, 
the mind is not the active voluntary cause of that volition ; 
because it does not arise from, nor is regulated by, choice 
or design. And therefore it cannot be, that the mind 
should be the active, voluntary, determining cause of the 
first and leading volition that relates to the aSbir. The 
mind's being a designing cause only enables it to produce 
effects in consequence of its design ; it will not enable it 
to be the designing cause of all its own designs. The 
mind's being an elective cause will only enable it to pro- 
duce effects in consequence of its elections^ and according 
to them ; but cannot enable it to be the elective cause 
of all its own elections ; because that supposes an election 
before the first election. So the mind's being an active 
cause enables it to produce effects in consequence of its . 
own actSy but cannot enable it to be the determining cause 



seci*. ▼• f HESE EVASIONS IJ1P£BT1N£NT. 81 

of all it^ own acts ; for that is still in the same manner a 
oontradictioq, as it supposes a determining act conversant 
about the first act, and prior tcf it, having a causal influence 
on its existence and manner of existence. 

I can conceive of nothing else that can be meant by 
the soul's having power to cause and determine its own 
volitions, as a being to whom God has given a power of 
action, but this: that God has given po^er to the soul, 
sometimes^ at least, to excite volitions at its pleasure, or 
according as it chooses. And this certainly supposes, in 
all such cases, a choice preceding all volitions which are 
thus caused, even the first of them ; which runs into the 
fore-mentioned great absurdity. 

Ti>erefore the activity of the nature of the soul affords 
no relief from the difficulties which the notion of a self- 
determining power in the will is attended with ; nor will 
it help, in the least,' its absurdities and inconsistencies. 

SECTION V. 

SHOWING, THAT IF THE THINGS ASSERTED IN THESE EVASIONS 
SHOULD £E SUPPOSED TO BE TBUE, THEY ARE ALTOGETHER IM- 
PERTINENT, AND CANNOT HELP THE CAUSE OF ARMINIAN LIB- 
ERTY ; AND HOW (this BEING THE STATE OF THE CASE) AR- 
MINIAN WRITERS ARE OBLIGED TO TALK INCONSISTENTLY. 

What was last observed in the preceding section, may 
show, not only that the active nature of the soul cannot 
be a reason why an act of the will is, or why it is in this 
manner rather than another ; but also that if it could be 
so, and it could be proved that volitions are contingent 
events, in that sense, that their being and manner of being 
is not fixed or determined by any cause, or anything an- 



82 THESE EVASIOK8 IllPlIRTlNENT. PARt. 11. 

tecedent ; it would not at all serve the purpose of Ar<* 
minians to establish the freedom of the wiU, according 
to their notion of its freed()hi, as consisting in the will's 
determination of itself ; which supposes every free act 
of the will to be determined by some act of the will going 
before to determine it ; inasmuch as for the will to deter- 
mine a thing, is the same as for the soul to determine a 
thing by vnlling ; and there is no other way that the 
will can determine an act of the will, than by willing that 
act of the will, or, which is the same thing, choosing it. 
So that here must be two acts of the will itk the case, 
one going before another, one conversant about the olh* 
er, and the latter the object of the former, and chosen by 
the former. If the will does not cause and determine the 
act by choice, it does not cause or determine it at all ; for 
that which is not determined by choice is not determined 
voluntarily or willingly; and to say that the will deter- 
vqit9es something which the soul does not determine wil- 
'■iig'y? is as much as to say that something is done by the 
will which the soul doth not with its will. 

So that if Arminian liberty of will, consisting in the 
will's determining its own acts, be maintained, the old ab- 
surdity and contradiction must be maintained, that every 
free act of will is caused and determined by a foregoing 
free act of will ; which doth not consist with tlie free acts 
arising without any cause, and being so contingent as not 
to be fixed by anything foregoing. So that this evasion 
must be given up, as not at all relieving, and as that which 
instead of supporting thissort of liberty, directly destroys it. 

And if it should be supposed that the soul determines 
its own acts of will some other way than by a foregoing 
act of will, still it will not help the cause of their liberty 






SECT. y« THESE EVASIONS IMPERTINENT. 83 

erf* will. If it detemiines tbem by an act of the understand- 
iDgy or some other power, then the will does not deter- 
mine itself; and so the ielf-dettrmining power of the will 
is given up. And what liberty is there exercised, accor- 
ding to their own opinion of liberty, by the soul's being 
determined by something besides its own choice 7 The 
acts of the will, it is true, may be directed and effectually 
determined and fixed ; but it is not done by the souPs 
own will and pleasure: there is no exercise at all of choice 
or will in producing the effect ; and if ioill and choice are 
not exercised in it, how is the liberty of the will exer- 
cised in it ? 

So that let Arminians turn which ^ny they please, 
with their notion of liberty consisting in the will's deter- 
mining its own acts, their notion destroys itself. If they 
hold every free act of will to be determined by the soul's 
own free choice, or foregoing free act of will, foregoing 
either in the order of time or nature, it implies that gross 
contradiction that the 6rst free act belonging to the affair 
is determined by a free act which is before it ; or if they J., 
say that the free acts of the will are determined by some 
other act of the soul, and not an act of will or choice, 
this also destroys their notion of liberty consisting in the 
acts of the will being determined by the will itself; or if 
they hold that the acts of the will are determined by noth- 
ing at all that is prior to them, but that they are contin- 
gent in that sense, that they are determined and fixed by 
no cause at all, this also destroys their notion of liberty 
consisting in the will's determining its own acts. 

This being the true state of the Artninian notion of lib- 
erty, it hence comes to pass that the writers that defend 
it are forced into gross inconsistencies in what they say

upon this subject. To instance in Dr. Whitby : he, in 
his discourse on the freedom of the will,* opposes the 
opinion of the Calvinists, who place man's liberty only 
in a power of doing what he willy as that wherein they 
plainly agree with Mr. Hobbes. And yet he himself men- 
tions the very same notion of liberty as the dictate of the 
sense and common reason of mankind, and a rule laid 
down by the light of nature; viz. that liberty is a power 
of acting from ourselves, or doing what we wiLL.f 
This is indeed, as he says, a thing agreeable to the sense 
and common reason of mankind ; and therefore it is not 
so much to be wondered at, that he unawares acknow- 
ledges it against himself: for if liberty does not consist in 
this, what else can be devised that it should consist in ? 
If It be said, as Dr. Whitby elsewhere insists, that it does 
not only consist in liberty of doing what we will, but also 
a liberty of willing without necessity, still the question 
returns, what does that liberty of willing without necessity 
consist in, but in a power of willing as we please, without 
being impeded by a contrary necessity, or, in other words, 
a liberty for the soul in its willing to act according to its 
own choice ? Yea, this very thing the same author seems 
to allow, and suppose again and again, in the use he 
makes of sayings of the Fathers, whom he quotes as his 
vouchers. Thus he cites the words of Origen, which he 
produces as a testimony on his side :J 3%c sonl acts by 
HER OWN CHOICE, and it is free for her to incline to 
whatever part she will. And those words of Justin 
Martyr :<5» the doctrine of the Christians is this, that

toothing is done or suffered according to fatCy but that 
every man doih good or evil according to his own 
PRCB CHOICE. And iroin Eusebius these words:"* If 
fate he established ^ philosophy and piety are overthrown ; 
all these thivgs depending upon the necessity introduced 
by the siars^ and not upon meditation and exercise pro- 
CRGDiNG FROM OUR OWN FREE CHOICE. And again, the 
words of Maccarius : f God^ to preserve the liberty of 
masi^s will, suffered their bodies to die, that it might be 
IN THEIR CHOICE to tum to good Or evil. They who are 
acted by the Holy Spirit are not held under any necessity, 
but have liberty to turn themselves, and do what thet 
WILL in this life. 

Thus the doctor, in effect, comes inio that very notion 
of liberty which the Calvinists have ; which he at the 
^same time condemns, as agreeing with the opinion of Mr. 
Hobbes, namely, the souPs acting by its own choice, men's 
doing good or evil according to their own free choice, 
their being in that exercise which proceeds from their 
own free choice^ having it in their choice to tum 
to good or evil, and doing what they will. So that if 
men exercise this liberty in the acts of the will themselves, 
it must be in exerting acts of will as they v^\]\, or according 
to their own free choice, or exerting acts of will thai pro* 
ceedfrom their choice. And if it be so, then let every one 
judge whether this does not suppose a free choice going be- 
fore the free act of will, or whether an act of choice does 
not go before that act of the will which proceeds from it. 
And if it be thus with all free acts of the will, then let every 
one judge, whether it will not follow, that there isa free 
choice or will going before the 6rst free act of thGi.^wiH

exerted in the case. And then let every one judge, 
whether this be not a contradiction. And finally, let 
every one judge whether, in the scheme of these writers, 
there be any possibility of avoiding these absurdities. 

If liberty consists, as Dr. Whitby himself says, in a 
man's dmng what he will; and a man exercises this lib- 
erty, not only in external actions, but in the acts of the 
will themselves ; then, so far as liberty is exercised in the 
latter, it consists in willing what he wiUs ; and if any say 
so, one of these two things must be meant ; either, 1. 
That a man has power to will, as he does will ; because 
what be wills, he wills ; and therefore has power to will 
what ho has power to will. If this be their meaning, 
then all this mighty controversy about freedom of the will 
and self-determining power, comes wholly to nothing ; all 
that is contended for being no more than this, that the 
mind of man does what it does, and is the subject of what 
it is the subject of, or that what is, is ; wherein none has 
any controversy with them. Or, 2. The meaning must 
be, that a man has power to will as he pleases or chooses 
to will : that is, he has power by one act of choice, to 
choose another ; by an antecedent act of will, to choose 
a consequent act ; and therein to execute his own choice. 
And if this be their meaning, it is nothing but shuffling 
with- those they dispute with, and baffling their own rea- 
son. For still the question returns. Wherein lies man's 
liberty in that antecedent act of will which chose the 
consequent act? The answer, according to the same 
principles, must be, that his liberty in this also lies in bis 
willing as he would, or as he chose, or agreeable to ano- 
ther act of choice preceding that. And so the question 
returns in infinitunif and the like answer must be made in 



itCT. VI, or CHOOSINC Ilf THINGS INDIFFERENT. 87 

infinitum ; in order to support their opinion, there must 
be no beginning, but free acts of will must have been cho- 
sen by foregoing free acts of will in the soul of every 
man, without beginning ; and so before he had a being, 
fram all eternity. 

SECTION VI. 

CONCERNING THE WILLIS DETERMINING IN THINGS WHICH 
ARE PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT IN THE VIEW OF THE MIND. 

A GREAT argument for self-determining power is the' 
supposed experience we universally have of an ability to 
determine our wills, in cases wherein no prevailing mo^ 
tive is presented ; the will (as is supposed) has its choice 
to make between two or more things, that are perfectly 
equal in the view of the mind ; and the will is apparently 
altogether indifferent ; and yet we find no difficulty in 
coming to a choice ; the will can instantly determine it<- 
self to one, by a sovereign power which it has over itself, 
without being moved by any preponderating inducement. 

Thus, the fore-mentioned author of an '^Essay on the 
Freedom of the Will,"etc. pp. 25, 26, 27, supposes, 
** That there are many instances wherein the will is deter- 
mined neither by present uneasiness nor by the greatest 
apparent good, nor by the last dictate of the understand- 
ing, nor by anything else, but merely by itself, as a sove- 
reign selfodetermining power of the soul ; and that the 
soul does not will this or that action, in some cases, by 
any other influence but because it will. Thus (says he) 
I can turn my face to the south, or the north ; I can point - 
with my finger upward or downward. — And thus, in some 
cases, the will determines itself in a very sovereign man* 



88 or CHOOSING in things IMDltFSRKNT. FART II* 

ner, because it will, without a reason borrowed from the 
understanding ; and hereby it discovers its own ))erfect 
power of choice, rising from wit bin itself, and free from 
all influence or restraint of any kind." And in pages 
66, 70, and 73, 74, this author very expressly supposes 
the will in many cases to be detern)ined by no motive at 
all, and acts altogether without motive or ground ofpre^ 
ference. — Here 1 would observe, 

1. The very supposition which is here made directly 
contradicts and overthrows itself. For the thing suppo- 
sed, wherein this grand argument consists, is, that among 
several things the will actually chooses one before ano- 
ther, at the same time that it is perfectly indifferent ; 
which is the very same thing as to say the mind has a 
preference, at the same time that it has no preference. 
What is meant cannot be, that the mind is indifferent be« 
fore it comes to have a choice, or until it has a prefer* 
cnce ; or, which Is the same thing, that the mind is tndit 
ferent until it comes to be not indifferent. For certainly 
this author did not suppose he had a controversy with 
any person in supposing' this. And then it is nothing to 
his purpose, that the mind which chooses was indifferent 
once ; unless it chooses, remaining indifferent ; for other- 
wise, it does not choose at all in that case of indifference, 
concerning which is all the question. Besides,. it appears 
in fact, thut the thing which this author supposes, is not 
that the will chooses one thing before another, concern- 
ing which it is indifferent before it chooses, but also is in- 
different when it chooses, and that its being otherwise 
than indifferent is not until afterwards, in consequence of 
its choice ; that the chosen things appearing preferable 
and more agreeable than another, arises from Us choice 



SCOT. Vt. or CHOOSING IN THINGS INDIFFERENT. 89 

already made. His words are (p. :)0), " Where the ob- 
jects which are proposed appear equally fit or good, the 
will is left without a guide or director ; and therefore 
must take its own choice by its own determination ; it 
being properly a self-determining power. And in such 
cases the will does as it were make a good to itself by its 
own choice, i. c. creates its own pleasure or deligln in 
this self-chosen good. Even as a man, by seizin*; upon 
a spot of unoccupied land in an uninhabited countr)', 
makes it his own possession and property, and as such re- 
joices in it. Where things were indifferent before, the 
will finds nothing to make them more agreeable, consid- 
ered merely in themselves ; but the pleasure it feels aris- 
ing prom ITS OWN CHOICE, and its perseverance therein. 
We love raanv things which we have chosen, and purh- 

LY BECAUSE WE CHOSE THEM." 

This is as much as to say, tfiat we first begin to prefer 
many things, now ceasing any longer to be indifferent 
with respect to them, purely because we have preferred 
and chosen them before. — These things must needs be 
be spoken inconsiderately by this author. Choice or pre- 
ference cannot be before itself in the same instance, ei- 
ther in the order of time or nature. It cannot be the 
foundation of itself, or the fruit or consequence of itself. 
The very act of choosing one thing rather than afiotkeri. 
IS preferring that thing, and that is setting a higher value) 
on that lhin«. But that the mind sets a higher value on one 
thing than another, is not, in the first place, the fruit of 
its setting a higher value on that thing. 

This author says, p. 36, " The will may be perfectly 
indifferent, and yet the will may determine itself to choose 
one or the other." And again, in the same page, " I am 

8* 



90 or THE will's DETERMINlNCf ^AAT II* 

entirely indifierent to either ; and yet my will raay deter- 
mine itself to choose." And again^ ^< Which I shall 
choose must be determined by the mere act of my will." 
If the choice is determined by a mere act of will, then 
the choice is determined by a mere act of choice. And 
concerning this matter, viz. Thai the act of the will itself 
is determined by an act of choice, this writer is express, 
in p. 1'2. Speaking of the case where there is no superior 
fitness in objects presented, he has these words : " There 
it must act by its own choice, and determine itself as 
it PLEASES." Where it is supposed that the very deter- 
tninaiion, which is the ground and spring of the wilPs 
act, is an act of choice and pleasure wherein one act is 
more agreeable, and the mind better pleased in it, than 
another ; and this preference, and superior pleasedness, 
is the ground of all it does in the case. And if so, the 
mind is not indifferent when it determines itself, but h^td 
rather do one thing than another, hud rather determine 
itself one way than another. And therefore the will does 
not act at all in indifference, not so much as in the first 
step it takes, or the first rise and beginning of its acting. 
If it be possible for the understanding to act in indiffer(^nce, 
yet to be sure the will never does ; because the will's 
beginning to act is the very same thing as its beginning to 
choose or prefer. And if in the very first act of the will, 
the mind prefers something, then the idea of that thing 
preferred does at that time preponderate, or prevail in the 
mind ; or which is the same thing, the idea of it has a pre- 
vailing influence on the will. So that this wholly des- 
troys the thing supposed, viz. That the mind can by a 
sovereign power choose one of two or more things^ which 
in the view of the mind are, in every respect, perfectly 



SECT. IT. IN THINGS INDITFERfiNT. 91 

equal, one of which does not at all preponderate, nor has 
any prevailing influence on the mind above another. 

So that this author, in bis grand argument for the ability 
of the will to choose one of two, or more things, concern- 
ing which it is perfectly indifferent, does at the same tinier 
in effect, deny the thing he supposes, and allows and as- 
sarts the point be endeavors to overthrow ; even that the 
will, in choosing, is subject to no prevailing influence of 
the idea, or view of the thing chosen. And indeed it is 
impossible to offer this argument without overthrowing it ; 
the thing supposed in it being inconsistent with itself, and 
that which denies itself. To suppose the will to act at all 
in a state of perfect indifference, either to determine itself, 
or to do anything else, is to assert that the mind chooses 
without choosing. To say that when it is indifferent, it 
can do as it pleases, is to say that it can follow its pleas- 
ure, when it has no pleasure to follow. And therefore, 
if there be any difliculty in the instances of two cakes, 
or two eggs, etc. which are exactly alike, one as good as 
another ; concerning which this author supposes the mind 
in fact has a choice^ and so. in effect supposes that it has a 
preferenccy it as much concerned himself to solve the difli- 
culty, as it does those whom he opposes. For if these 
instances prove anything to his purpose, they prove that 
a man chooses without-choice. And yet this is not to his 
purpose ; because if this is what he asserts, his own words 
are as much against him, and do as much contradict him, 
as the words of tho^p he disputes against can do. 

2. There is no great difliculty in showing, in sucli in- 
^ stances as are alleged, not only that it must needs be so^ 
that the mind must be influenced in its choice by some- 
thing that has a preponderating influence upon it, but also 



/^ 



"^ or tR£ WILLIS DETERMINING PART H. 

how it is so, A little attention to our own experience, 
and a distinct consideration of the acts of our own minds, 
in such cases, will be sufficient to clear up the matter. 
Thus, supposing I have ft chess-board before me ; and 
t' y because I am required by a superior, or desired by a friend, 

or to make some experiment concerning' my own ability 
and liberty, or on some other consideration, I am deter- 
mined to touch some one of the spots or squares on tbto 
board with my finger ; not being limited or directed in the 
first proposal, or my own first purpose, which is general, 
to any one in particular ; and there being nothing in the 
squares, in themselves considered, that recommends any 
one of all the sixty-four, more than another; in this case 
my mind determines to give itself up to what is vulgarly 
called accident,* by determining to touch that square 
which happens to be most in view, which my eye is es- 
- pecially upon at ihat moment, or which happens to be 
then most in my mind, or which I shall be directed to by 
some other such like accident. Here are several steps 
of the mind's proceeding (though all may be done as it 
were in a moment): ihejirst step is its general deter- 
mination that it will touch one of tlie squares. The next 
step is another general determination to give itself up to 
accident, in some certain way ; as to touch that which 
shall be most in the eye or mind at that time, or to some 
other such like accident. The third and last step is a 
particular determination to touch a certain individual 

* 1 have elsewhere observed what that is which is vulgarly called 
aeeident ; that it is nolhing akin to the Arniinian metaphysical no- 
tion of cmUingeiice, something not connected with anything forego- 
ing ; but that it is something that comes to pass in the course of 
things, in some affair ihat men are concerned in, unforeseen, and nol 
owing to their design. 






S8CT. Tl. In things INJDirFERCNt. 6A 

spot, even that square which, by that sort of accident the 
mind has pitched upon, has actually ojBfered itself beyond 
others. Now it is apparent, that in none of these several 
steps does the mind proceed in absolute indifference, but 
in each of them is influenced by a preponderating induce- 
ment. So it is in the first step ; the mind's general deter-* 
mination to touch one of Uie sixty-four spots : the mind is 
not absolutely indifferent whether it does so or no: it is 
induced to it, for the sake of making some experiment, or 
by the desire of a friend, or some other motive that pre- 
vails. So it is in tlie second step ; the mind's determin- 
ing to give itself up to accident, by touching that which 
shall be most in the eye. or the idea of which shall be 
niost prevalent in the mind, etc. The mind is not abso« 
lately indifferent whether it proceeds by this rule or no ; 
but chooses it because it appears at that time a convenient 
and requisite expedient in order to fulfil the general pur* 
pose aforesaid. kn6 so it is in the third and last step ; 
it is determining to touch that individual spot which actu- 
ally does prevail in the mind's view. The mind is not 
mdifferent concerning this ; but is influenced by a pre- 
vailing inducement and reason ; which is, that this is a 
prosecution of the preceding determination, which appear- 
ed requisite, and was fixed before in the second step. 

Accident will ever serve a man, without hindering him 
a moment, in such a case. It will always be so among 
a number of objects in view ; one will prevail in the eye, 
or in idea, beyond others. When we have our eyes open 
in the clear sunshine, many objects strike the eye at once, 
and innumerable images may be at once painted in it by 
the rays of light ; but the attention of the mind is nol 
equal to several of them at once ; or if it be, it does no( 



94 6F TBE WILLIS D|:TERMmiNO| Etc. ^Attl* tU 

continue so for any time. And so it id with respect to 
the ideas of the mind in general : several Ideas are not in 
equal strength iii the mind's view and notice at once ; or 
at least) do not remain so for any sensible continuance^ 
There is nothrng in the world more constantly varying^ 
than the ideas of the mind : they do not remain precisely 
in the same state for the least perceivable space of time ) 
as is evident by t\)is: That all perceivable tiirie is judged 
and perceived by the mind only by the succession or the 
successive changes of its own idea«. Therefore, while 
the views or perceptions of the minJ remain precisely in 
the same state, there is no perceivable space or length of 
time^ because no sensible successioif at all. 

As the acts of the will, in each step of the foreMneif'' 
tioned procedure, do not come to pass without a particu- 
lar cause, every act is»owing to a prevailing inducement : 
so the accident, as I have called it, or that which hap* 
pens in the unsearchable course of things, to which tb9 
mind yields itself, and by which it is guided, is not any 
thing that comes to pass without a cause ; and the mind in 
determining to be guided by it, is not determined by some- 
thing that lias no cause ; any more than if it determined 
to be guided by a lot, or the casting of a die. For though 
the die's falling in such a manner be accidental to him 
tliat casts it, yet none will suppose that there is no cause 
why it falls as it does. The involuntary changes in the 
succession of our ideas, though the cause may not be ob« 
served, have as much a cause, as the changeable motions 
of the motes that float in the air, or the continual, infinitely 
various, successive changes of the unevenness on the sur- 
face of the water. 

There are two things especially, which are probably 



SCCT. Ti* Oi^ CHOOSING 111 YH1NG9 INDIFFERENT. 95 

the occasions of confusion in the minds of them who in- 
sist upon it, that the will acts in a proper indi^erence, and 
without being moved by any inducement, in its determina- 
tions in such cases as have been mcntioried. 

I. They seem to mistake tlie point in question, or at 
least not to keep it distinctly in view. The question they 
dispute about, is. Whether the mind be indiflferent about 
the objects presented, one of which is to be taken, touch^ 
ed, pointed to, etc., as two eggs, two cakes, which ap- 
pear equally good. Whereas the question to be consid- 
ered is. Whether the person be indifferent with respect to 
bis own actions ; whether he does not, on some considera- 
tion or other, prefer one act with respect to these objects 
before another. The mind in its determination and choice, 
in these cases, is not most immediately and directly con- 
versant about the objects presented ; but the acts to be done 
concerning these objects. The objects may appear equal, 
and the mind may never properly make any choice be- 
tween them : but the next act of the will being about the 
external actions to be performed, taking, touching, etc., 
these may not appear equal, and one action may properly 
be chosen before another. In each step of the mind's 
progress, the determination is not about the objects, unless 
indirectly and improperly, but about the actions, which, 
it chooses for other reasons than any preference of the 
objects, and for reasons not taken at nil from the objects. 

There is no necessity of supposing that the mind does 
ever at all properly choose one of the objects before ano- 
ther ; either before it has taken, or afterwards. Indeed, 
the man chooses to take or toiLch one rather than ano- 
ther ; but not because it chooses the thing taken y or 
touched; but from foreign considerations. The case may 



96 OF CHOOSING tit tHINGS IKDlFFERCNT. PART 11. 

be so, that of two things offered, a man may, for certain 
reasons, choose and prefer the taking of that which he 
undervalues, Hud choose to neglect to take that which his 
mind prefers. In such a case, choosing ^he thing taken, 
and choosing to take, are diverse ; and so they aire in a 
case where the things presented are equal in the mind's 
esteem, and neither of them preferred. All that fact 
and experience make evident is, that the mind choos- 
es one action rather than another ; and therefore the ar- 
guments which they bring, in order to be to their purpose, 
ought to be to prove that the mind chooses the action in 
perfect indifference with respect to thai action; and 
not to prove that the mind chooses the action in per* 
feet indifference with respect to the object; which is 
very possible, and yet the will not act at all without preva- 
lent inducement, and proper preponderalion. 

2. Another reason of confusion and difficulty in this 
matter seems to be, not distinguishing betM'cen a general 
indifference, or an indifference with respect to what is to 
be done in a more distant and general view of it, and a 
particular indifference, or an indifference with respect to 
the next immediate act, viewed with its particular and 
present circumstances. A man may be perfectly inciiffer- 
ent with respect to his own actions, in the former respect, 
and yet not in tl>e latter. ThuSj'in the foregoing instance 
of touching one of the squares of a chess-board ; when it 
is fii-st proposed that I should touch one of them, I may 
be perfectly indifferent which I touch ; because as yet I 
view the matter remotely and generally, being but in the 
first -step of the mind's progress in the affair. But yet, 
when I am actually come to the last step, and the very 
next thing to be determined is, which is to be touched, 



SECT. ¥11. OF I.IBB&TY OF INPIFF£RENOE. 97 

having already determined that I will touch that which 
happens to be most in my eye or mind, and my^mind be- 
ing now fixed on a particular one, the act of touching that, 
considered thus immediately, and in these present cir- 
cumstances, is not what my mind is absolutely indifferent 
about.

IN INDIFFERENCE. 

What has been said in the foregoing section has a ten- 
dency, in some measure, to evince the absurdity of the 
opinion of such as place liberty in indifference, or in that 
equilibrium whereby the will is without all antecedent de- 
termination, or bias, and left hitherto free from any pre- 
possessing inclination to one side or the other ; that the 
determination of the will to either side may be entirely 
from itself, and that it may be owing only to its own pow- 
er, and that sovereignty which it has over itself, that it 
goes this way rather than that.* 

* Dr. Whitby, and some other Arminiang, make a distinction of 
different kinds of freedom ; one of God, and perfect spirits above ; 
another of persons in a state of trial. , The former. Dr. Whitby al- 
lows to consist with necessity ; the latter, he holds to be without ne- 
cessity ; and this latter he supposes to be requisite to our being the 
subjects of praise or dispraise, rewards of punishments, precepts and 
prohibitions, promises and threats, exhortations and dehortations, and 
a covenant treaty. And to this freedom he supposes indifferenee to 
be requisite. In his discourse on the Five Points, pp. 299, 300, he 
says: — **It is a freedom (speaking of a freedom not only from co-ac- 
tion, bat from necessity) requisite, as we conceive, to render as ca- 
pable of trial er probation, and to render our actions worthy of praise 
or dispraise, and our persons of rewards or punishments." And in

But inasmuch as this has been of such long standing, 
and has been so generally received, and so much insisted 
on by Pelagians, semi-Pelagians, Jesuits, Socinians, Ar- 
minians, and others, it may deserve a more full conside- 
ration. And therefore I shall now proceed to a more par- 
ticular and thorough inquiry into this notion. 

Now lest some should suppose that I do not understand 
those that place liberty in indifference, or should charge 
me with misrepresenting their opinion, I would signify, 
that I am sensible there are some, who, when they talk 
of the liberty of the will as consisting in indifference, ex- 
press themselves as though they would not be understood 
of the indifference of the inclination or tendency of the 
will, but of, 1 know not what, indifference of the soul's 
power of willing ; or that the will, with respect to its 
power or ability to choose, is indifferent, can go either 
way indifferently, either to the right hand or left, either 
act or forbear to act, one as well as the other. Though 
this seems to be a refining only of some particular wri- 
ters, and newly invented, and which will by no means con- 
sist with the manner of expression used by the defen- 
ders of liberty of indifference in general. And I wish 
such refiners would thoroughly consider whether they dis- 
tinctly know their own meaning, when they make a dis- 
tinction between indifference of the soul as to \is power or 
ability of willing or choosing, and the soul's indifference 

the next page, speaking of the same matter, he says, '< Excellent to 
this purpose are the words of Mr. Thorndike : We say not that in- 
difference is requisite to all freedom f but to the freedom of man alone in 
this state of travail and proficience : the ground of which is God's ten- 
der of a treaty f and conditions of peace and reconcilement to fallen fimn, 
together vsiih those precepts and prohibitions, those promises and threats^ 
those exhortations and defiortationSf it is enforced with." 



SECT. YII. or LIBERTY OF INDIFFERENCE. 99 

as to the prefereace or choice itself: and whether they do 
not deceive themselves in imagining that they have any 
distinct meaning at all. The indifference of the soul as to 
its ability or power to will, roust be the same thing as the 
indifference of the state of the power or faculty of the will, 
or the indifference of the state which the soul itself, which 
has that power or faculty^ hitherto remains in, as to the 
ezercbe of that power, in the dioice it shall by and by 
make. 

But not to insist any longer on the abstruseness and in* 
explicableness of th'is distinction, let what will be suppo- 
sed concerning the meaning of them that make use of it, 
thus much must at least be intended by Anninians when , 
they talk of indifierence as essential to liberty of will, if : 
they intend anything, in any respect to their purpose ; viz, 
that it is such an indifference as leaves the will not deter- 
mined already ; but free from actual possession, and va- 
cant of predetermination, so far, that there may be room 
for the exercise of the ^elf-determining power of the will ; 
and that the will's freedom consists in, or depends upon, 
this vacancy and opportunity that is left for the will itself 
to be the determiner of the act that is to be the free act. 

And here I would observe in ihejirst place, that to 
make out this scheme of liberty, the indifference must be 
perfect and absolute ; there must be a perfect freedom 
from all antecedent preponderation, or inclination. Be- 
cause, if the will be already inclined, before it exerts its 
own sovereign power on itself, then its inclination is not 
wholly owing to itself; if when twoopposites are propo- 
sed to the soul for its choice, the proposal does not find 
the soul wholly in a state of indifference, then it is not 
found in a state of liberty for mere self-determination. 



100 or L1BBKTT or WILL rART II. 

The least degree of an aDtecedeDt bias roast be ificonsis- 
tent with tbeir notioD of liberty. For so long as prior 
iocIlQation ^possesses the will, and is not removed, it binds 
4be will, so tbat it is utterly impossible that the will should 
act otherwise than agreeably to it. Surely the will can- 
not act or choose contrary to a remaining preTailing incli- 
nation of the will. To suppose otherwise^ would be the 
same thing as to suppose tbat the will is inclined contra- 
ry to its present prevailing inclination, or contrary to what 
it is inclined to. (That which the will chooses and pre- 
fers, that, all things considered, it preponderates and in- 
clines to."^ It is equally impossible for the will to choose 
contrary to its own remaining and present preponderating 
inclination^ as it is to prefer contrary to its own present 
preference or choose contrary to its own present choice. 

I The will, therefore, so long as it is under the influence 

^ of an old preponderating inclination, is not at liberty for 
a new free act, or any act that shall now be an act of sel& 

\ determination. The act which is a self-determined free 
act, must be an act which the will determines in the pos- 
session and use of such a liberty, as consists in a free- 
dom from everything, which, if it were there, would 
make it impossible that the will, at that time, should be 
otherwise than that way to which it tends. 

If any one should say there is no need that the indit 
ference should be perfect ; but although a former inclina- 

' tion and preference still remains, yef, if it be not very 
strong and violent, possibly the strength of the will may 
oppose and overcome it ; this is grossly absurd ; for the 
strength of the will, let it be never so great, does not at all 
enable it to act one way, and the contrary way, both at 
the same time. It gives it no such sovereignty and com* 






SECT. VII. CONSISTIHG IN INDIFFERENCE. 101 

roand, as to cause itself to prefer and not to prefer at the 
same time, or to choose contrary to its own present 
choice. 

Therefore, if there be the least degree of antecedent 
preponderation of the will, it must he perfectly abolished 
before the will can be at liberty to determine itself the 
contrary way. And if the will determines itself the same 
way, it was not a free determination, because the will is 
not wholly at liberty in so doing ; its determination is not 
altogether from itself but it was partly determined be- 
fore, in its prior inclination ; and all the freedom the will 
exercises in the case is in an increase of inclination, which 
it gives itself, over and above what it had by foregoing 
bias ; so much, is from ilself, and so much is from perfect 
indi£ference. For though the will had a previous ten- 
dency that way, yet as to that additional degree of inclina* 
tion, it had no tendency ; therefore the previous tendency 
is of no consideration, with respect to the act wherein tiie 
will is free. So that it comes to the same thing which was 
said at Grst, that as to the act of the will, wherein the will 
is free, there must be perfect indifference or equilibrium. 

To illustrate this ; if we should suppose a sovereign 
self-moving power in a natural body, but that the body 
is in motion already, by an antecedent bias; for instance, 
gravitation towards the centre of the earth ; and has one 
degree of motion already, by virtue of that previous ten- 
dency ; but by .its self-moving power it adds one degree 
more to its motion, and moves so much more swiftly to- 
wards the centre of the earth than it would do by its 
gravity only ; it is evident, that all that is owing to a self- 
moving power in this case, is the additional degree of mo- 
tion ; and that the other degree of motion which it bad 



102 or LIBERTT OF WILL PAET U. 

from gravity, is of no consideration in the case, does not 
help the effect of the free self-moving power in the leasts 
the effect is just the same as if the body bad received 
from itself one degree of motion from a state of perfect 
rest. So, if we should suppose a self*moving power giv- 
en to the scale of a balance, which has a weight of one de- 
gree beyond the opposite scale ; and we ascribe to it an 
ability to add to itself another degree of force the sam« 
way, by its self-moving power ; this is just the same thing 
as to ascribe to it a power to give itself one degree of 
preponderation from a perfect equilibrium ; and so much 
power as the scale has to g;ive itself an over-balance from 
a perfect equipoise, so much self-moving self-prepondera- 
ting power it has, and no more. So that its free power 
this way is always to- be measured from perfect equilibria 
um. 

I need say no more to prove, that if indifference be es- 
sential to liberty, it must be perfect indifference ; and that 
so far as the will is destitute of this, so far it is destitute 
of that freedom by which it b its own master, and in a 
capacity of being its own determiner, wittiout being at all 
passive, or subject to the power and sway of something 
else, in its motions and determinations. 

Having observed these things, let us now try whether 
this notion of the liberty of will consisting in indifference 
and equilibrium, and the will's self-determination in such 
a state, be not absurd and inconsistent. 

And here I would lay down this as an axiom of un- 
doubted truth ; that every free act is done in a state of 
freedom, and not only after such a state. If an act 
of the will be an act wherein the soul is free, it must be 
exerted in a state of freedom^ and in the time of freedom. 






SBCT. ril. CONSISTING IN INBITFCRENCfi. 103 

It will not suffice, that tlie act immediately follows a 
€tate of liberty ; but liberty must yet continue, and co* 
exist with the act ; the soul remaining in possession of 
liberty. Because that is the notion of a free act of the 
soul, even an act wherein the soul uses or exercises lib* 
erty. But if the soul is not, in the very time of the act, 
in the possession of liberty, it cannot at that time be in the 
use of it. 

Now the question is, whether ever the soul of man 
puts forth an act of will, while it yet remains in a state of 
liberty, in that notion of a state of liberty, viz» as imply- 
ing a state of indiiSference ; or whether the soul ever ex* 
erts an act of choice or preference, while atr that very 
time the will is in a perfect equilibrium, not inclining one 
way more than another. The very putting of the ques- 
tion is sufficient to show the absurdity of the affirmative 
answer 'y for how ridiculous would it be for any body to 
insist, that the soul chooses one thing before another, 
when at the very same instant it is perfectly indijSereut 
with respect to each ! This is the same thing as to say, 
the soul prefers one thing to another, at the very same 
time that it has no preference. — Choice and preference 
can no more be in a state of indifference, than motion can 
be in a slate of rest, or than the preponderation of the 
scale of a balance can be in a state of equilibrium. Mo- 
tion may be the next moment after rest ; but cannot co- 
exist with it in any, even the least part of it. So, choice 
may be immediately after a state of indifference, but has 
no co-existence with it; even the very beginning of it is 
not in a state of indifference. And therefore if this be \ 
liberty, no act of the will, in any degree, is ever perform- | 
ed in a state of liberty, or in the time of liberty. Volt- 



104 OF LIBBBTY OF WILL PART. II. 

tioD and liberty are so far from ag^eing together, and be- 
ing essential one to another, that they are contrary one to 
another, and one excludes and destroys the other, as 
much as motion and rest, light and darkness, or life and 
death. So that the will acts not at all, does not so much 
as begin to act, in the time of such liberty ; freedom is 
perfectly at an end, and has ceased to be, at the first mo- 
ment of action ; and therefore liberty cannot reach the 
action, to affect, or qualify it, or give it a denomination, 
or any part of it, any more than if it had ceased to be, 
twenty years before the action began. The moment that 
liberty ceases to be, it ceases to be a qualification of any- 
thing. If light and darkness succeed one another instan- 
taneously, light qualifies nothing afier it is gone out, to 
make any thing lightsome or bright, any more at the first 
moment of perfect darkness, than months or years after. 
Life denominates nothing vital at the first moment of per- 
fect death. ^So freedom, if it consists in, or implies, indif- 
ference, can denominate nothing free, at the first moment 
of preference or preponderation^ Therefore it is manifest,' 
that no liberty which the soul is posessed of, or ever uses, 
in any of its acts of volition, consists in indifference ; and 
that the opinion of such as suppose that indifference be- 
longs to the very essence of liberty, is to the highest de- 
gree absurd and contradictory. 

If any one should imagine, that this manner of arguing 
is nothing but a trick and delusion ; and, to evade the 
reasoning, should say, that the thing where'n the will 
exercises its liberty, is not in the act of choice or prepon- 
deration itself, but in (/e^eniimng* itself to a certain choice 
or preference ; that the act of the will wherein it is free, 
and uses its own sovereignty, consists in its causing or 



SECT. Til. CONSI8TIMO IK INDIITERENCE. 105 

determining the change or irtnuitian from a state of in- 
difiereoce to a certaio preference, or determining to give 
a certain turn to the balance, which has hitherto been 
even ; and that this act the will exerts in a state of liberty, 
or while the will yet remains in equilibrium, and perfect 
master of itself : — I say, if any one chooses to express his 
notion of liberty after this, or some such manner, let us 
see if he can make out his matters any better than before. 
What is asserted is, that the will, while it yet remains 
in perfect equilibrium, witl)out preference, determines to 
change itself from that state, and excite in itself a certain 
choice or preference. Now let us see whether this does 
not come to the same absurdity we had before. If it be 
8O9 that the will, while it yet remains perfectly indifferent, 
determines to put itself out of that state, and give itself a 
certain preponderation ; then, I would inquire, w^hether 
the soul does not determine this of choice ; or whether 
the will's coming to a determination to do so, be not the 
same thing as the soul's coming to a choice to do so. 
If the soul does Hot determine this of choice, or in the ex- 
ercise of choice, then it does not determine it, voluntarily ; 
and if the soul does not determine it voluntarily, or of its 
own willy then in what sense does its ufUl determine it ? 
And if the will does not determine it, then how is the lib" 
erty of the will exercised in the determination ? What 
sort of liberty is exercised by the soul in those determina* 
tions, wherein there is no exercise of choice, which are not 
voluntary, and wherein the will is not concerned ? — But if 
it be allowed, that this determination is an act of choice, 
and it be insisted on that the soul, while it yet remains in a 
state of perfect indifference, chooses to put itself out of that 
state, and to turn itself one way ; then the soul is alreac^^ 



106 OF L1BJ6ATX OV WILL PABT 11* 

come to a choice, and chooses that way. And so we have 
the very same absurdity which we had before. Here is the 
soul in a state of choice, and in a state of equilibrium, both 
at the same time : the soul already choosing one way, 
while it remains in a state of perfect indifference, and 
has no choice of one way more than the other. — And in- 
deed this manner of talking, though it may a little hide 
the absurdity in the obscurity of expression, is more non- 
sensical, and increases the inconsistency. To say, the 
' free act of the will, or the act which the will exerts in a 
state of freedom and indifference, does not imply prefer- 
■ ence in it, but is what the will does in order to causing or 
I producing a preference, is as much as to say, the soul 
; diooses (for to will and to choose are the same thing) 
I without choice, and prefers without preference, in order 
; to cause or produce the beginning of a preference, or the 
? first choice. And that is, that the first choice is exerted 
without choice, in order to produce itself. 

If any, to evade these things, should own, that a state 
of liberty and a state of indifference are not the same, 
and that the former may be without the latter ; but should 
say, that indifference is still essential to the freedom of an 
act of will, in some sort, namely, as it is necessary to go 
immediately before it ; it being essential to the freedom 
of an act of will that it should directly and immediately 
arise out of a state of indifference : still this will not help 
the cause of Arminian liberty, or make it consistent with 
itself. For if the act springs immediately out of a ^tate 
of indifference, then it does not arise from antecedent 
choice or preference. But if the act arises directly out 
of a state of indifference, without any intervening choice 
IQ choose apd determine it, then the act not being deter* 



atCT. TII. CONSISTING IN INDIFFERENCE. 107 

iiiined by choice, is not determined by the will ; the rotnd 
exercises no free dioice in the^ affair, and free choice and 
free will have no hand in the determination of the act. 
Which is entirely inconsistent with their notion of the 
freedom of volition. 

If any should suppose, that these difficulties and absur- 
dities may be avoided, by saying, that the liberty of the 
mind consists in a power to augend the act of the will, 
and so to keep it in a state of indifference untilnhere has 
been opportunity for consideration ; and so shall say, that 
however indifference is not essential to liberty in such a 
manner that the mind must make its choice in a state of 
indifference, which is an inconsistency, or that the act of 
will must spring immediately out of indifference, yet in- 
difference may be essential to the liberty of acts of the ^ , 
wijl in this respect, viz.. That liberty consists in a poweH ^^f' 
of the mind to forbear or suspend the act of volition, andWi^"^'^.* 
keep the mind in a state of indifference for the present,/ |l«^ 
until there has been opportunity for proper deliberation ; 
I say, if any one imagines that this helps the matter, it is 
a great mistake ; it reconciles no inconsistency, and re- 
lieves no dii&culty, which the affair is attended with. — 
For here the following things must be observed : 

1. That this ^tt^pencfeng* of volition, if there be prop- , 
erly any such thing, is itself an act of volition. If the 
mind determines to suspend its act, it determines it vol-*'*'/ ' ^ 
untarily ; it chooses, on some consideration, to suspend ^ /' \ 
it. And this choice or determination is an act of the will : ' f 
and indeed it is supposed to be so in the very hypothesis ; :/ 

for it is supposed that the liberty of the will consists in 
its power to do this, and that its doing it is the very thing 
wherein the will exercises its liberty. But how can the 



108 OF liberty's lying in a power fart II. . 

will exercise liberty in it, if it be not an act of the will ? 
The liberty of the will is not exercised in anything but 
what the will does. 

2. This detennining to suspend acting is not only an 
act of th^ will, but it is supposed to be the only free act 
of the will ; because it is said, that thii is the thing 
wherein the liberty of the will conmte, — ^Now if this be 
so, then this is all the act of will that we have to consider 
in this controversy, about the liberty of will, and in our 
inquiries, wherein the liberty of man consists. And now 
the fore^nientioned difficulties remain : the former quea* 
tion returns upon us, viz. Wherein consists tlie. freedom 
of the will in those acts wherein it is free ? And if this 
act of determining a suspension be the only act in which 
the will is free, then wherein consists the will's freedom 
with respect to this act of suspension ? And how is in- 
difference essential to this act ? The answer must be, ac- 
cording to what is supposed in the evasion under consid- 
eration—That the liberty of the will, in this act of sus- 
pension, consists in a power to suspend even this act, 
until there has been opportunity for thorough deliberation. 
But this will be to plunge directly into the grossest non- 
sense : for it is the act of suspension itself that we are 
speaking of; and there is no room for a space of delibera- 
tion and suspension in order to determine whether we 
will suspend or no. For that supposes, that even suspen- 
sion itself may be deferred ; which is absurd : for the very 
deferring the determination of suspension, to consider 
whether we will suspend or no, will be actually suspen- 
ding. For during the space of suspension, to consider 
whether to suspend, the act is ipso facto suspended. 
There is no medium between suspending to act, and im- 



tKCT. Til. 09 SnSPENOilia VOLITION. 109 

mediately acting ; and therefore bo possibility of avoiding 
either the one or the other one raomeot. 

And besides, this is attended with ridiculous absurdity 
another way : for now it is come to that, that liberty 
consists wliolly in the mind's having power to suspend its 
determinatbn, whether to suspend or no ; that there may 
be time for consideration, whether it be best to suspend. 
And if liberty cons'ists in this only, then this is the liberty 
under consideration: we have to inquire now, how liberty 
with respect to this act of suspending a determin^ation of 
suspension, consists in indifference, or how indifference is 
essential to it. The answer according to the hypothe- 
sis we are upon, must be, that it- consists in a power of 
suspending even this last-roentioned act, to have time to 
consider whether to suspend that. And then the same 
difficulties and inquiries return over again with respect to 
that ; and so on for ever. Which if it would shew any 
thing, would shew only that there is no such thing as a 
free act. It drives the exercise of freedom back in injinu 
turn; and that is to drive it out of the world. 

And besides all this, there is a delusion, and a latent 
gross contradiction, in the affair another way ; inasmuch 
as, in explaining how, or in what respect, the will is free 
with regard to a particular act of volition, it is said, that 
its liberty consists in a power to determine to suspend that 
aciy which places liberty not in that act of volition which 
the inquiry is about, but altogether in another antecedeoi 
act. Which contradicts the thing supposed in both the 
question and answer. The question is, wherein consisfii 
the mind's liberty in any particular act of volition ? And 
the answer in pretending to shew wherein lies the miadV 
liberty in that act^ in effect says, it does not lie in that 

10 



110 OF THE SUPPOSED LIBERTY ^ PART If. 

at all, but in another, vis. a volition to suspend that act. 
And therefore the answer is both contradictory, and alto- 
gether inipertinent and beside the purpose. For it does 
not shew wherein the liberty of the will consists in the 
act in question ; instead of that, it supposes it does not 
consist in that act at all, but in another distinct from it, 
even a volition to suspend that act^ and take time to con- 
sider of it. And no account is pretended to be given 
wherein the mind is free with respect to that act, wherein 
this answer supposes the liberty of the mind indeed con- 
sists, viz. the act of suspension, or of determining the sus- 
pension. 
/ On the whole, it is exceeding manifest, that the liberty 
of the mind does not consist in indifference, and that in- 
1 difference is not essential or necessary to it, or at all belong- 
j ing to it, as the Arminians suppose ; that opinion being 
\ full of nothing but absurdity and self-contradiction. 

SECTION VIII. 

CONCERNING THE SUPPOSED LIBERTY OF THE WILL, AS OPFOSITB 

TO ALL NECESSITY. 

It is a thing chiefly insisted on by Arminians, in this 
controversy, as a thing most important and essential in hu^ 
man liberty, that volitions, or the acts of the will are con- 
tingent events ; understanding conlingence as opposite, 
not only to constraint, but to all necessity. Therefore 1 
would particularly consider this matter. And 

1. I would inquire, whether there is, or can be, any 
such thing as a volition which is contingent in such a sense, 
as not only to come to pass without any necessity of con- 
straint or coaction, but also without a necessity of const- 



8KCT. Tfll. WITHOUT ALL KBCESSITr. Ill 

quencBf or an infallible connection with anything fore- 
going. 

2. WhetbeTy if it were so, this would at all help the 
cause of liberty. 

I would consider whether volition is a thing that ever 
does, or can, come to pass, in this manner, contingently. 
And here it must be remembered, that it has been already 
shewn, that nothing can ever come to pass without a cause, 
or reason why it exists in this manner rather than another ; 
and the evidence of this has been particularly applied to 
the acts of the will. Now if this be so, it will demonstra- 
bly follow, that the acts of the will are never contingent, 
or without necessity, in the sense spoken of; inasmuch 
as those things which have a cause or reason of their ex- 
istence, must be connected with their cause. This ap- 
pears by the following considerations. 

1. For an event to have a cause and ground of its ex- 
istence, and yet not to be connected with its cause, is an 
inconsistency. For if the event be not connected with 
the cause, it is not dependent on the cause ; its existence 
is, as it were, loose from its influence, and may attend it, 
or may not ; it being a mere contingence, whether it fol- 
lows or attends the influence of the cause, or not : and that 
is the same thing as not to be dependent on it. And to 
say, the event is not dependent on its cause, is absurd : 
it is the same thing as to say, it is not its cause, nor the 
event the effect of it ; for dependence on the influence of 
a cause is the very notion of an effect. If there be no 
such relation between one thing and another, consisting 
in the connection and dependence of one thing on the in- 
fluence of another, then it is certain there is no such rela- 
tion between them as is signified by the terms cause and 



113 OF THE SUPPOSED LIBERTT PART II. 

tfftd. So fiir as an event k dependent on a cause and 
connected with it, so much causality is there in the case, 
and no more. Tlie cause does, or brings to pass, no 
more in any event, than is dependent on it. If we say, 
the connection and dependence is uot total, but partial, 
and that the effect, though it has some connection and de> 
pendence, yet is pot entirely dependent on it ; that is the 
same thing asto say, that not all that is in the event is 
au effect of that cause, but that only part of it arises from 
thence, and part some other way. 

2. If there are son^e events which are not necessarily 
connected with their causes, then it will follow, that there 
are some things which come to pass without any cause, 
contrary to^the supposition. For if there be any event 
which was not necessarily connected with the influence 
of the cause under such circumstances, then it wiis coo« 
tingent whether it would attend or follow the influence of 
the cause, or jio ; ifmight have followed, and it might 
not, when the cause was the same,^its influeMife the same, 
and under the same circumstances. And if so, why did 
it follow, rather than not follow ? There is no cause or 
reason of this. Therefore here is something without any 
cause or reason why it is, viz. the following of the efiect 
on the influence of tiie cause, with which it was not ne* 
cessarily connected. If there be a necessary connection 
of the effect on anything antecedent, then we may sup- 
pose that sometimes the event will follow the cause, and 
sometimes not, when the cause is the same, and in every 
respect in the same state and circumstances. And what can 
be thecasue and reason of this strange phenomenon, even 
this diversity, that in one instance, the effect should fol- 
low, in another not ? It is evident by the supposition, 



SECT. VIII. WITHOUT A^L NCCESSITT. 113 

that this Is wholly withont any canse or ground. Here 
is something in the present manner of the existence of 
thingS; and state of the world, tiiat is absolutely without 
a cause. Which is contrary to the supposition, and con- 
trary to what has been before demonstrated. 

3. To suppose there are some events which have a 
cause and ground of their existence, that yet are not ne* 
cessarily connected with their cause, is to suppose that 
they have a cause which is not their cause. Thus ; if the 
effect be not necessarily connected with the cause, with 
its influence, and influential chcumstances ; then, as I 
observed before, it is a thing possible and supposable, that 
the cause may sometimes exert the same influence, under 
the same circumstances, and yet the effect not follow. 
And if this actually happens in any instance, this instance 
is a proof, in fact, that the influence of the cause is not 
sufficient to produce the effect. For if it had been sufli- 
cient, it would have done it. And yet, by the supposi- 
tion, in another instance, the same cause, with perfectly 
the same influence, and when all circumstances whici) 
have any influence are the same, it wa$ followed with 
the effect. By which it is manifest that the effect in this 
last instance was not owing to the influence of the causae, 
but must come to pass some other way. For it was 
proved before, that the influence of the cause was not suffi- 
cient to produce the effect. And if it w as not sufficient 
to produce it, then the production of it could not be owing 
to that influence, but must be owing to something else, 
or owing to nothing. And if the ef&ct be not owing to 
the influence of the cause, then it is not the cause. Which 
brings us to the contradiction, of a cause, and no cause ; 
that which is the ground and reason of the existence of 

10* 



114 OF THE SUPPOSED LIBEHTT, ETC. PART.II. 

a thing, and at the same time is not the ground and rea* 
son of its existence, nor is sufficient to be so. i 

If the matter be not already so plain as to render any 
further reasoning upon it impertinent, 1 would say, that 
that which seems to be the cause in the supposed case, 
can be no cause; its power and* influence having, on a 
full trial, proved insufficient to produce such an effect : 
and if it be not sufficient to produce it, th^n it does not 
produce it. To say otherwise, is to say, there is power 
to do that which there is not power to do. If there be 
in a cause sufficient power exerted, and in circumstances 
sufficient to produce an effect, and so the effect be actual' 
ly produced at one time ; these things all concurring, will 
produce the effect at aU times. And so we may turn it the 
other way ; that which proves not sufficient at one time, 
cannot be sufficient at another, with precisely the same in* 
fluential circumstances. And therefore if the effect fol- 
lows, it is not owing to that cause ; unless tlie different 
time be a circumstance which has influence ; but that is 
contrary to the supposition .; for it is supposed that all cir- 
cumstances that irave influence are the same. And besides, 
this would be to suppose the time to be the cause ; which* 
is contrary to the supposition of the other thing's being 
the cause. But if merely diversity of time has no influ- 
ence, then it is evident that it is as much of an absurdity 
to say, the cause was sufficient to produce the efibct at one 
time, and not at anotiier ; as to say, that it is sufficient to 
produce tlie effect at a certain time, and yet not sufficient 
to produce the same effect at the same time. 

On the whole, it is clearly manifest, that every effect 
has a necessary connection with its cause, or with that 
which is the true ground and reason of its existence* And 



8SCT. IX. CONNECTION OF THE WILL, ETC. 115 

therefore, if there be no event .without a cause, as was pro- 
ved before, then no event whatsoever is contingent in the 
manner that Arminians suppose the free acts of the wiU to 
be contingent. 

SECTION IX. 

OF THE CONNECTION OF THE ACTS OF THE WILL WITH THE 
DICTATES OF THE UNDERSTANDING. 

It is manifest, that the acts of the will are none of them 
contingent in such a sense as to be without all necessity, 
w soL'as not to be necessary with a necessity of conse- 
quence and connection ; because every act of the will is 
some way connected with the understanding, and is as the 
greatest apparent good is, in the manner which has alrea- 
dy been explained ; namely, that the soul always wills or! 
chooses that which, in the present view of the mincl,con-i 
sidered in the whole of that view, and all that belongs toi 
it, appears most agreeable. Because, as was observed* 
before, nothing is more evident than that, when men act 
voluntarily, and do what they please, then they do what 
appears roost agreeable to them ; and to say otherwise, 
would be as much as to affirm, that men do not choose 
what appears to suit them best, or what seems most pleas- 
ing to them ; or that they do not choose what they pre- 
fer. Which brings the matter to a contradiction. 

And it is very evident in itself, that the acts of the will 
have some connection with the dictates or views of the 
understanding ; so this is allowed by some of the chief of 
the Arminian writers, particularly by Dr. Whitby and 
Dr. Samuel Clarke. Dr. Turnbull, though a great ene- 
my to the doctrine of necessity, allows the same thing. 



116 CONNECTION OF THE WILL PART 11. 

Id bis '< Christian Philosophy," (p. 196) he with much 
iBpprobation cites another philosopher, as of the same mind, 
in these words : '^ No man (says an excellent philoso- 
pher) sets himself about anything, but upon some view or 
other, which serves him for a reason for what he does ; 
and whatsoever faculties he employs, the understanding, 
with such light as it has, well or ill formed, constantly 
leads ; and by that light, true or false, all her operative 
powers are directed. The will itself, how absolute and 
incontrollable soever it may be thought, never failsjn its 
obedience to the dictates of the understanding. Temples 
have their sacred images; and we see what influence 
they have always had over a great part of mankind ; but 
in truth, the ideas and images in men's minds are the in- 
visible powers that constantly govern them ; and to these 
they all pay universally a ready submission." 

But whether this be in a just consistence with them- 
selves, and their own notions of liberty, I desire may now 
be impartially considered. 

Dr. Whitby plainly* supposes, that the acts and deter- 
minations of the will always follow the understanding's 
apprehension or view of the greatest good to be obtained, 
or evil to be avoided ; or, in other words, that the deter- 
minations of the will constantly and infallibly follow these 
two things in the understanding : 1. The degree of good 
to be obtained, and evil to be avoided, proposed to the 
understanding, and apprehended, viewed, and taken notice 
of by it. 2. The degree of the understanding's view^ 
notice, or apprehension of that good or evil ; which is in- 
creased by attention and consideration* That this is an 
opinion he is exceeding peremptory in (as he is in every 
opinion which he maintains in his controversy with the 



SECT. IX. WITH THE UNDBRBTANDIKO.' 117 

Calvtnists) with disdain of the contrary opinion^ «$ absurd 
and self-contradictory, will appear by the following words 
of bis, in his discourse on the Five Points.* 

<* Now it is certain, that what naturally makes the un- 
derstanding to perceive, is evidence proposed and appre- 
hended, considered or adverted to ; for nothing else can 
be requisite to make us come to the knowledge of the 
truth. Again, what makes the will choose, is something 
approved by the understanding; and consequently appear- 
ing to the soul as good. And whatsoever it refusetb, is 
something represented by the understanding, and so ap- 
pearing to the will as evil. Whence all that God requires 
of us is and can be only this ; to refuse the evil, and 
choose the good. Wherefore, to say that evidence pro- 
posed, apprehended, and considered, is not sufficient to 
make the understanding approve ; or that the greatest 
good proposed, the greatest evil threatened, when equal- 
ly believed and reflected on, is not sufficient to engage the 
will to choose the good and refuse the evil, is in effect to 
say, that which alone doth move the will to choose or to re- 
yiife, is not sufficient to engage it so to do ; which being 
contradictory to itself, must of necessity be false. Be it 
then so, that we naturally have an aversion to the truths 
proposed to us in the Gospel ; that only can make us in-^ 
disposed to attend to them, but cannot hinder our convic- 
tk>n, when we do apprehend them, and attend to them. 
Be it, that there is in us also a renitency to the good we 
are to choose ; that only can indispose us to believe it is, 
and to approve it as our cbiefest good. Be it, that we 
are prone to the evil that we should decline ; that only 
can render it the more difficult for us to believe it is the

worst of evils. But yet, what we do really believe to bt 
our chief est goody will still be chosen; and what we op* * 
prehend to be the worst oj evils, will, whilst we do con* 
tinue under that conviction, be refused by us. It there- 
fore can be only requisite, in order to these ends, that the 
good Spirit should so illuminate our understandings, that 
we, attending to, and considering, what lies before us, 
should apprehend, and be convinced of our duty; and 
that the blessings of the Gospel should be so propounded 
to us, as that we may discern them to be our cbiefest good ; 
and the miseries it threateneth, so as we may be convinced 
that they are the worst of evils ; that we may choose the 
one, and refuse the other." 

Here let it be observed, how plainly and peremptorily 
it is asserted, that the greatest good proposed, and the 
greatest evil threatened, when equally believed andreflec* 
ted on, is sufficient to engage the will to choose the good, 
and refuse the evil, and is that alone which doth move 
the will to choose or to refuse ; and that it is contradiC' 
tory to itself, to suppose otherwise ; and, therefore, must 
of necessity be false; and then what we do really believe 
to be our chiefest good, will still be chosen ; and what 
we apprehend to be the worst of evils, will, whilst we 
continue under that conviction, be refused by us. Noth* 
ing could have been said more to the purpose, fully to 
signify and declare, that the determinations of the will 
must evermore follow the illumination, conviction, and - 
notice of the understanding, with regard to the greatest 
good and evil proposed, reckoning both the degree of 
good and evil understood, and the degree of understand- 
ing, notice, and conviction, of that proposed good and eVil ; 
and that it is thus necessarily, and can be otherwise in no 



■ 



SECT. IX. WITH TBC ITNDCBSTAimiNO. 119 

instance ; because it is asserted, that it implies a contra- 
diction, to suppose it ever to be otherwise. 

I am sensible, the doctor's aim in these assertions is 
against the Calvintsts ; to shew, in opposition to them,\ 
that there is no need of any physical operation of the \ 
Spirit of God on the will, to change and determine that t 
to a good choice, but that God's operation and assistance | 
is only moral, suggesting ideas to the understanding ; 
which he supposes to be enough, if those ideas are attend- 
ed to, infallibly to obtain the end. But whatever his de- 
sign was, nothing can more directly and fully prove, that 
every determination of the will in choosing and refusing, 
is necessary ; directly contrary to his own notion of the lib- 
erty of the will. For if the determination of the will ev- 
ermore in this manner follows the light, conviction, and 
view of the understanding, concerning the greatest good 
and evil, and this be that alone which moves the wiH, and| 
it be a contradiction to suppose otherwise ; then it is ne-| 
cessarily so, the will necessarily follows this light or view 
of the understanding, not only in some of its acts, but in 
every act of choosing and refusing. So that the will does 
not determine itself in any one of its own acts ; but all its I 
acts, every act of choice and refusal, depends on, and is 
necessarily connected with, some antecedent cause ; wJiich 
cause is not the will itself, nor any act of its own, nor any 
thing pertaining to that faculty, but something belonging 
to another faculty, whose acts go before the will, in all 
its acts, and govern and determine them every one. 

Here, if it should be replied, that although it be true, 
tliat, according to the doctor, the final determination of 
the will always depends upon, and is infallibly connected 
with, the understanding's conviction, and notice of the 



120 CONNECTION Or THE WILL PART II* 

greatest good ; yet the acts of the wiH are not necessarji 
because that conviction and notice of the understanding is 
first dependent on a preceding act of the will, in deter- 
mining to attend to, and take notice of the evidence ex- 
hibited ; by which means the mind obtains that degree of 
conviction, which is sufficient and effectual to determine 
the consequent and ultimate choice of the will ; and that 
the will with regard to that preceding act, whereby it de» 
termines whether to attend or no, is not necessary ; and 
that in this the liberty of the will consists, that when God 
holds forth sufficient objective light, the will is at liberty 
whether to command the attention of the mind to it. 

Nothing can be more weak and inconsiderate than such 
a reply as this. For that preceding act of the will, 
in determining to attend and consider, still is an act of 
fhe will (it is so to be sure, if the liberty of the will con- 
sists in it, as is supposed), and if it be an act of the will, 
it is an act of choice or refmaL And therefore, if what 
the doctor asserts be true, it is determined by some ante- 
cedent light in the understanding, concerning the greatest 
apparent good or evil. For he asserts, it is that light 
which alone doth move the toUl to choose or refuse. 
And therefore the will must be moved by that in choos- 
ing to attend to the objective light offered, in order to 
another coilsequent act of choice ; so that this act is no 
less necessary than the other. And if we suppose ano- 
ther act of the will, still preceding both these mentioned, 
to determine both, still that also must be an act of the 
will, and an act of choice; and so must, by the same 
principles, be infallibly determined by some certain degree 
of light in the understanding concerning the greatest 
good. And let us suppose as many acts of the will, one 



SCCT. IX. WITH THE imOBESTANDING. 121 

preceding toother, as we please, yet they are every ooe 
of them necessarily determined by a certain degree of . 
light in the understanding, concerning the greatest and 
most eligible good in that case ; and so, not one of them 
free, according to Dr. Whitby's notion of freedom. And 
if it be said, the reason, why men do not attend to light 
held forth, is because of ill habits contracted by evil acts 
committed before, whereby their minds are indisposed to 
attend to, and consider of the truth held forth to them by 
God ; the difficulty is not at all avoided ; still the ques- 
tion returns,(Wbat determined the will in those preceding 
evil acts?^ It must, by Dr. Whitby's principles, still be 
the view of the understanding concerning the greatest good 
and evil. If this view of the understanding be that alone ■ 
which doth move the will to choose or refuse^ as the doc- ; 
tor asserts, then every act of choice or refusal y from a ! 
man's first existence, is moved and determined by this I 
view ; and this view of the understanding exciting and ' 
governing the act, must be before the act ; and therefore i 
the will is necessarily determined, in every one of its acts, 
from a man's first existence, by a cause beside the will, 
and a cause tliat does not proceed from, or depend on, 
any act of the will at all. Which at once utteiiy abol- 
ishes the doctor's whole scheme of liberty of will; and 
be, at one stroke, has cut the sinews of all his arguments 
from the goodness, righteousness, faithfulness, and sincer- 
ity of God, in his commands, promises, threatenings, calls, 
invitations, expostulations ; which he makes use of, under 
the heads of reprobation, election, universal redemption, 
sufficient and eflTectual grace, and the freedom of the win 
of man ; and has enervated and made vain all those ex- 
clamations against the doctrine of the Calvinists, as cbaiy*

ing God with manifest unrighteousness, unfaiibfuloess, hy- 
pocrisy, fallaciousness, and cruelty ; which be has over, 
and over, and over again, numberless times in bis book. 

Dr. Samuel Clarke, in his " Demonstration of the Be- 
ing and Attributes of God,"* to evade the argument to 
prove the necessity of volition, from its necessary connec- 
tion with the last dictate of the understanding, supposes 
the latter not to be diverse from the act of the will itself. 
But if it be so, it will not alter the case as to the evidence 
of the necessity of the act of the will. If the dictate of 
the understanding be the very same with the determina- 
tion of the will or choice, as Dr. Clarke supposes, then 
this determination is no fruit or effect of choice : and if 
so, no liberty of choice has any hand in it : as to volition 
or choice, it is necessary, that is, choice cannot prevent 
it. If the last dictate of the understanding be tbe same 
with the determination of volition itself, then the existence 
of that determination must be necessary as to volition ; 
inasmuch as volition can have no opportunity to determine 
whether, it shall exist or no, it having existence already 
before volition has opportunity to determine anything. It 
is itself the very rise and existence of volition. But a 
thing, after it exists, has no opportunity to determine as 
to its own existence ; it is too late for that. 

If liberty consists in that which Arminians suppose, viz. 
in the will's determining its own acts, having free oppor- 
tunity, and being without all necessity ; this is the same 
as to say, that liberty consists in the soul's having power 
and opportunity to have what determinations of the will 
it pleases or chooses. And if the determinations of the 
will, and the last dictates of the understanding, be the same 

* Sixth edit. p. 93. 



BSCT. IX. WITH THE TTNDERSTANDINtS. 123 

thing, then liberty consists in the mind's having power to 
have what dictates of the understanding it pleases, having 
opportunity to choose its own dictates of understanding. 
But this is absurd ; for it is to make the determination of 
choice prior to the dictate of the understanding, and the 
ground of it, which cannot consist with the dictate of un- 
derstanding's being the determination of choice itself. 

Here is no way to do in this case, but only to recur to 
the. old absurdity of one determination before another, and 
the cause of it ; and another before that, determining that ; 
and so on tw infimtum. If the last dictate of the under-' 
standing be the determination of the will itself, and the} 
soul be free with regard to that dictate, in the Arminian; 
notion of freedom ; then the soul, before that dictate of 
its understanding exists, voluntarily and according to its ; 
own choice determines, in every case, what that dictate \ 
of the understanding shall be ; otherwise, that dictate, ; 
as to the will, is necessary, and the acts determined by it '; 
must also be necessary. So that here is a determination 
of the mind prior to that dictate of the understanding ; ^n 
act of choice going before it, choosing and determining 
what that dictate of the understanding shall be : and this ; 
preceding act of choice, being a free act of will, must also ! 
be the same with another last dictate of the understanding: 
and if the mind also be free in that dictate of understanding, 
that must be determined still by another ; and so on for 
ever. 

Besides, if the dictate of the understanding, and deter- 
mination of the will, be the same, this confounds the un- 
derstanding and will, and makes them the same. Wheth- 
er they be the same or no, I will not now dispute ; but 
only would observe, that if it be so, and the Arminian no- 



124 CONNECTION OF THK WILL FABT II. 

tioo of liberty consists in a selMeterniining power in the 
understanding, free of ail necessity ; being independent, 
undetermined by anything prior to its own acts and do* 
terminations ; and the more the understanding is thus in- 
dependent, and sovereign over its own determinations, the 
more free. By this therefore the freedom of the soul, a» 
a moral agent, must consist in the independence of the 
understanding on any evidence or appearance of things, 
or anything whatsoever, that stands forth to the view of 
the mind, prior to the understanding's determination. And 
what a sort of liberty is this ! consisting in an ability, free- 
dom^ and easiness of judging, either according to evidence, 
or against it ; having a sovereign command over itself at 
all times, to judge, either agreeably or disagreeably to what 
is plainly exhibited to its own view. Certainly it is no lib- 
erty that renders persons the proper subjects of persuasive 
reasoning, arguments, expostulations, atid such like moral 
means and inducements. The use of which with mankind 
is a main argument of the Arminians, to defend their no<' 
tion of liberty without all necessity. For according to this, 
the more free men are, the less they are under the govern- 
ment of such means, less subject to the power of evidence 
and reason, and more independent on \hcir influence in 
their determinations. 

And whether the understanding and will are the same 
or no, as Dr. Clarke seems to suppose, yet, in order to 
maintain the Arminian notion of liberty without necessity, 
the free will is not determined by the understanding, nor 
necessarily connected with the understanding; and the 
further from such connection, the greater the freedom. 
And when the liberty is full and complete, the determi- 
nations of the will have no connection at all with the die-* 



,SBCT. X. WITir THE UNDERSTANDING. 125 

tates of the undei'staDding. And if so, in vain are all tl^e 
applications to the understanding, in order to induce to any 
free virtuous act ; and so in vain are all instructions, coun- 
sels, invitations, expostulations, and all arguments and 
persuasives whatsoever; for these are but applications to 
the understanding, and a clear and lively exhibition of the 
objects of choice to the mind's view. But if, after all, the 
will must be self-determined, and independent of the un- 
derstanding, to what purpose are things thus represented 
to the understanding, in order to determine the choice ? 

SECTION X. 

VOLITION NECESSARILY CONNECTED WITH THE INFLUENCE OP 
MOTIVES ; WITH PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS ON THE GREAT 
INCONSISTENCE OF MR. CHUBB's ASSERTIONS AND REASON*- 
ING8 ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 

That every act of the will has some cause, and consc- 
queiuly (by what has been already proved) has a neces- 
sary connection with its cause, and so is necessary by a 
necessity of connection and consequence, is evident by 
this, that every act of the will whatsoever is excited by 
some motive ; which is manifest, because, if the will or 
mind, in willing and choosing after the manner that it 
does, is excited so to do by no motive or inducement, 
then it has no end which it proposes to' itself, or pursues, 
in so doing ; it aims at nothing, and seeks nothing. And 
if it seeks nothing, then it does not go after anything, or 
exert any inclination or preference towards any thing. 
Which brings tlie matter to a contradiction ; because, for 
the mind to will something, and for it to go after something 
by an act of preference and inclination, are the same thJAfi* 

But if every act of the will is excited by a moti' 

11* 



126 ACTS OP THE WILL PART II. 

that motive is the cause of the act of the will. If the acts 
of tlie will are excited by motives, then motives are the 
causes of their being excited ; or, which is the same tbinflf, 
the cause of their being put forth into^ct and existence* 
And if so, the existence of the acts of the will is properijr 
the effect of their motives. Motives do nothing as mo- 
tives or inducements, hut by their influence ; and so mucli 
as is done by ilieir influence is the effect of them. For 
that is the notion of an effect, something that is brought 
to pass by the influence of another thing. 

And if volitions are properly the effects of their motives, 
then they are necessarily connected with their motives ; 
every effect and event being, as was proved before, ne- 
cessarily connected with that which is the proper ground 
and reason of its existence. Thus it is manifest that vo* 
^ liiion is necessary, and is not from any self-determining 
power in the will ; the volition, which is caused by pre- 
vious motive and inducement, is not caused bv the will 
exercising a sovereign power over itself, to determine^ 
cause, and excite volitions in itself. This is not consis- 
tent with the will's acting in a state of indifference and 
equilibrium, to determine itself to a preference ; for the 
way in which motives operate, is by biassing the will, 
and giving it a certain inclination or preponderation one 
way. 

Here it may be proper to observe, that Mr. Chubb, in 
bis Collection of Tracts on various subjects, has advanced 
a scheme of liberty which is greatly divided against itself, 
and thoroughly subversive of itself ; and that many ways. 

1. He is abundant in asserting, that the will, in all its 
acts, is influenced by motive and excitement ; and that 
this is the previous ground, and reason of all its acts, and 



SECT. X« CONNCCTED WITH MOTIVES. 127 

that it is never otherwise in any instance. He says, p. 
962 : No action can take place without some motive to ' 
excite ii. And in p. 263 : Volition cannot take place 
without Mome previous reiuon or motive to induce it. 
And in p. 310: Action would not take place unthoui 
some reason or motive to induce it ; it being absurd to 
supposCy that the active faculty would be exerted without 
some PREVIOUS reason to dispose the mind to action, 
^ also p. 257. And he speaks of these things, as what 
we may be absolutely certain of, and which are the fouii- 
dation, the only foundation we have, of a certainty of 
the moral perfections of God. Pages 252 — 255, 261 — 
264. 

And yet at the same time, by his scheme, the influ- 
ence of motives upon us, to excite to action, and to be 
actually a ground of volition, is consequent on the volition 
or choice of the mind. For he very greatly insists upon 
it, that in all free actions, before the mind is the subject 
of those Mitions which motives excite, it chooses to he 
so. It chooses, whether it will comply with the motive 
which presents itself in view, or not ; and when various 
motives are presented, it chooses which it will yield to, 
and which it will reject. So p. 256 : Every man has 
power to act, or to refrain from acting, agreeably with, 
or contrary to, any motive that presents. P. 257 : Every 
man is at liberty to act, or refrain from acting, agreea* 
blywith, or contrary to, what each of these motives, consid-- 
ered singly, would excite him to. — Man has power, and is 
as much at liberty, to reject the motive that does prevail, 
as he has power, and is at liberty, to reject those motives 
that do not. And so pp. 310, 311 : In order to consti-* 
tute a moral agent, it is nectary that he should havt 



128 INCONSISTENCE OF ITB. CHUBb's PART II. 

power to act, or to refrain from acting, vpofi such moral 
motives as he pleases. And to tbe like purpose in many 
other places. According to these things, the will acts 
first, and chooses or refuses to comply with tbe motive 
that is presented, before it falls under its prevailing inflii* 
ence ; and it is first determined by tbe mind's pleasure or 
choice, what motives it will be induced by, ^efore it is in- 
duced by them. 

Now, how can these things hang together ? How can 
the mind first act, and by its act of volition and choice 
determine what motives shall be the ground and reason 
of its volition and choice 1 For this supposes tbe choice 
is already made before the motive has its effect ; and that 
the volition is already exerted before the motive prevails, 
so as actually to be the ground of the volition ; and makes 
the prevailing of the motive, the consequence of the voli- 
tion, which yet it is the ground of. If the mind has al- 
ready chosen to comply with a motive, and to yield to its 
excitement, it does not need to yield to it afil# this ; for 
the thing is effected already that the motive would excite 
to, and the will is beforehand with the excitement ; and 
the excitement comes in too late, and is needless and in 
vain afterwards. If the mind has already chosen to yield 
to a niotive which invites to a thing, that implies, and in 
fact is, a choosing the thing invited to ; and the very act 
of choice is before the influence of tbe motive which in- 
duces, and is the ground of the choice \ the son is before- 
hand with the father that begets him ; the choice is sup- 
posed to be the ground of that influence of tbe motive, 
which very influence is supposed to be the ground of the 
choice. And so vice versa^ the choice is supposed to be 
the consequence of the influence of the motive, which in- 



SCO^. X. SCHEME OF L1BERTT| fitC. 120 

flueoce of the motive 13 the consequence of that very 
choice. 

And besides, if the wili acts first towards the motive 
before it falls under its influence, and the prevailing of the 
motive upon it to induce it to act and choose, be the fruit 
and consequence of its act and choice, then how is the 
motive a previous ground and reason of the act and 
choice, so that in the nature of the things volition cannot 
take place without some previous reason and motive to 
induce it; and that this act h consequent upon, and fol- 
lows the motive ? Which things Mr. Chubb often asserts, 
as of certain and undoubted truth. So that the very 
same motive is both previous and consequent, boih before 
and after, both thegrmmd and fruit of the very same thing ! 

II. Agreeable to the fore-mentioned inconsistent notion 
of the will's first acting towards the motive, choosing 
whether it will comply with it, in order to its becoming 
a ground of the wilPs acting, before any act of volition 
can take place, Mr. Chubb frequently calls motives and 
excitements to the action of the will, the passive ground 
or reason of that action. Which is a remarkable phrase ; 
than which I presume there is none more uniritelligible, 
and void of distinct and consistent meaning, in all the 
writings of Duns Scotus or Thomas Aquinas. When he 
represents the motive to action or volition as passive, he 
must mean — passive in that aflfair, or passive with rospect 
to that action, which he speaks of; otherwise it is nothing 
to his purpose, or relating to the design of his argument : 
he must mean, (if that can be called a meaning,) that the 
motive to volition is first acted upon or towards by the 
volition choosing to yield to it, making it a ground of ac- 
tion, or determining to fetch its influence from thence ; 



IdO INCONSISTfiKCe OF UR. CHUBb's PART. It. 

and so to make it a previous ground of its own excitation 
aud existence. Which is the same absurdity, as if one 
should say, that the soul of man, or any other thing, 
should, previous to its existing, choose what cause it would 
come into existence by, and should act upon its cause to 
fetch influence from thence to bring it into being ; and so 
its cause should he a passive ground of its existence ! 

Mr. Chubb does very plainly suppose motive or excite- 
ment to be the ground of the being of volition. He 
speaks of it as the ground or reason of the exertion of 
an act of the will, pp. 391, 392, and expressly says, that 
volition cannot TAKE place without some previous ground 
or motive to induce it, p. 363. And he speaks of the act 
as FROM the motive, and from the influence of the 
motive, p. 352 ; and from the influence that the motive 
has on the man for the production of an action, p. 
317. Certainly there is no need of multiplying words 
about this ; it is easily judged, whether motive can be the 
ground of volition's being exerted and taking place, so 
that the very production of it is from the influence of the 
motive, and yet the motive, before it becomes the ground 
of the volition, is passive, or acted upon by the volition. 
But this I will say, that a man, who insists so much on 
clearness of meaning in others, and is so much in bla* 
ming their confusion and inconsistence, ought, if he was 
able, to have explained his meaning in this phrase oipas^ 
sice ground of action, so as to shew it not to be confused 
and inconsistent. 

If any should suppose that Mr. Chubb, when he speaks* 
of motive as a passive ground of action, does not mean 
passive with regard to that volition which it is the ground 
of, but some other antecedent volition, (though his pur- 



SSCT. X. SCHEMfi 01* UBFRTT, ETC* 131 

pose and argument, and whole discourse, will by no means 
allow of such a supposition), yet it would not help the 
matter in the least. For (I.) if we suppose there to be 
an act of volition or choice, by which the soul chooses to 
yield to the invitation of a motive to another volition, by 
which the soul chooses something else ; both these sup- 
posed volitions are in effect the very same. A volition, 
or choosing to yield to the force of a motive inviting to 
choose something, comes to just the same thing as choos* 
ing the thing which the motive invites to, as I observed 
before. So that here can be no room to help the matter, 
by a distinction of two volitions. (2.) If the motive be 
passive with respect, not to the same volition that the 
motive excites to, but one truly distinct and prior ; yet, 
by Mr. Chubb, that prior volition cannot take place, 
without a motive or excitement, as a previous ground of 
its existence. For he insists, that it is absurd to suppose 
any volition should take place without some previous mo- 
tive to induce it. So that at last it comes to just the 
same absurdity ; for if every volition must have a previous 
motive, then the very Jirst in the whole series must be--*- 
excited by a pcivtous motive ; and yet the motive to that 
first volition is passive ; but cannot be passive with regard 
to another antecedent volition, because, by the supposition, 
it is the very first : therefore, if it be passive with respect 
to any volition, it must be so with regard to that very vo- 
lition that it is the ground of, and that is excited by it. 

III. Though Mr. Chubb asserts, as above, that every 
volition has some motive, and that in the nature of the 
thing, no volition can take flace without some motive to 
induce it; yet he asserts, that volition does not always 
Ibllow the strongest motive ; or, in other words, is not ; 



132 INCONSISTENCE OF MR. CUUBB's 1»ART It. 

governed by any superior strength of the motive that is 
followed, beyond motives to the contrary, previous to the 
volition itself. His own words, p. 258, are as follows : 
** Though with regard to physical causes, that which is 
strongest always prevails, yet it is otherwise with regard 
to moral causes. Of these, sometimes the stronger, some* 
times the weaker, prevails. And the ground of this difier** 
ence is evident, viz., that what we call moral causes, strict- 
ly speaking, are no causes at all, but barely passive reasons 
of, or excitements to, the action, or to the refraining from 
acting : which excitements we have power, or are at liber- 
ty, to comply with or reject, as I have showed above." And 
so, throughout the paragraph, he, in a variety of phrases, 
insists, that the will is not always determined by the strong- 
est motive, unless by strongest we preposterously mean 
actually prevailing in the event ; which is not in the mo- 
tive, but in the will ; but that the will is not always deter- 
mined by the motive, which is strqpgest, by any strength 
previous to the volition itself. And he elsewhere does 
abundantly assert, that the will is determined by no supe- 
rior strength or advantage that motives have from any 
constitution or state of things, or any circmstances what- 
soever, previous to the actual determination of the will. 
And indeed his whole discourse on human liberty implies 
it, his whole scheme is founded upon it. 

But these things cannot stand together. There is. such 
a thing as a diversity of strength in motives to choice, pre- 
vious to'the choice itself. Mr. Chubb himself supposes, 
that they do previously invite, inducey excite, and dispose 
the mind to action. This implies that they have some- 
thing in themselves that is inviting, some tendency to tn- 
duce and dispose to volition,^previous to volition itself* 



8KCT. X. SCHEME OF LIBERTY^ ETC. 133 

And if they have in themselves this nature and tendenc^i 
doubtless they have it in certain limited degrees, which 
are capable of diversity ; and some have it in greater de- 
grees, others in less ; and they that have most of this ten- 
dency, considered with all their nature and circumstances, 
previous to volition, they are tlie strongest motives ; and 
those that have least are the weakest motives. 

Now if volition sometimes does not follow the motive 
which is strongest, or has most previous tendency or ad- 
vantage, all things considered, to induce or excite it, but 
follows the weakest, or that which, as it stands previously 
in the mind's view, has least tendency to induce it ; here- 
in the will apparently acts wholly without motive, without 
any previous reason to dispose the mind to it, contrary to 
what the same author supposes. The act, wherein the 
will must proceed without a previous motive to induce it, 
is the act of preferring the weakest motive. For how ab- 
surd is it to ^ay, the mind sees previous reason in the mo- 
tive to prefer that motive before the other; and at the 
same time to suppose, that there is nothing in the motive, 
in its nature, state, or any circumstance of it whatsoever, 
as it stands in the previous view of the mind, that gives 
it any preference ; but, on the contrary, the other motive 
that stands in competition with it, in all these respects, 
has most belonging to it that is inviting and moving, and 
has most of a tendency to choice and preference. This 
is certainly as much as to say, there is previous ground 
and reason in the motive for the act of preference, and 
yet no previous, reason for it. By the supposition, as to 
all that is in the two rival motives, which tends to prefer- 
ence, previous to the act of preference, it is not in that 

which is preferred, but wholly in the other ; because ap- 

12 



134 INCONSISTENCE OF MR. CHUBb's PART II. 

pearing superior strength, and all appearing preferable- 
ness, is in that ; and y^t Mr. Chubb supposes, that the 
act of preference is from previous ground and reason in 
the motive which is preferred. But are these things 
consistent ? Can there be previous ground in a thing for 
an event that takes place, and yet no previous tendency 
in it to that event ? If one thing follows another, without 
any previous tendency to its following, then I should think 
it very plain that it follows it without any manner of pre- 
vious reason why it should follow. 

Yea, in this case, Mr. Chubb supposes that the event 
follows an antecedent or a previous thing, as the ground 
of its existence, not only that has no tendency to it, but 
a contrary tendency. The event is, the preference which 
the mind gives to that motive which is weaker, as it stands 
in the previous view of the mind ; the immediate antece- 
dent is, the view the mind has of the two rival motives 
conjunctly ; in which previous view of the mind, all the pre- 
ferableness, or previous tendency to preference, is suppos- 
ed to be on the other side, or in the contrary motive ; and 
all the unworthiness of preference, and so previous tenden- 
cy to comparative neglect, rejection, or undervaluing, is on 
that side which is preferred : and yet in this view of the 
mind is supposed to be the previous ground or reason of 
this act pf preference, exciting it and disposing the mind 
to it. Which I leave the reader to judge, whether it be 
absurd or not. If it be not, then it is not absurd to say, 
that the previous tendency of an antecedent to a conse- 
quent, is the ground and reason why that consequent does 
not follow ; and the want of a previous tendency to an 
event, yea, a tendency to the contrary, is the true ground 
and reason why that event does not follow. 



SECT. X. SCHEME OF LIBERTY^ ETC. 135 

Ad act of choice or preference is a comparative act^ 
wherein the mind acts with reference to two or more things 
that are compared, and stand in competition in the mind's 
view. If the mind, in this comparative act, prefers that 
which appears inferior in the comparison, then the mind 
herein acts absolutely without motive, or inducement, or 
any temptation whatsoever. Then, if a hungry man has 
the ofier of two sorts of food, both which he finds an ap- 
petite to, but has a stronger appetite to one than the oth- 
er, and there be no circumstances or excitements whatso- 
ever in the case to induce him to take either the one or 
the other, but merely his appetite ; if in the choice he 
makes between them, he chooses that which he has least 
appetite to, and refuses that to which he has the strongest 
appetite, this is a choice made absolutely without previ- 
ous motive, excitement, reason, or temptation, as much 
as if be were perfectly without all appetite to either : be- 
cause his volition in this case is a comparative act, attend- 
ing and following a comparative view of the food which 
he chooses, viewing it as related to, and compared with, 
the other sort of food, in which view his^ preference has 
absolutely no previous ground, yea, is against aH previous 
ground and motive. And if there be any principle in 
man, from whence an act of choice may arise after this 
manner, from the same principle volition may arise wholly 
without motive on either side. If the mind in its volition 
can go beyond motive, then it can go without motive ; 
for when it is beyond the motive, it is out of the reach of 
the motive, out of the limits of its influence, and so with- 
out motive. If volition goes beyond the strength and ten- 
dency of motive, and especially if it goes against its ten- 
dency, this demonstrates the independence of volition or 



136 iNCONsisTEircE or mr. chubb's part II 

motive. And if so, no reason can be given for what Mr. 
, Chubb so often asserts, even that in the nature of things 
volition cannot take plade vnthout a motive to induce it. 
, If the Most High should endow a balance with agency 
or activity of nature, in such a manner, that when unequal 
weights are put into the scales, its agency could enable it 
to cause that scale to descend which has the least weight, 
and so to raise the greater weight ; this would clearly de« 
monstrate, that the motion of the balance does not depend 
on weights in the scales, at least as much as if the balance 
sbduld move itself, when there is no weight in either 
scale* And the activity of the balance, which is suffi- 
cient to move itself against the greater weight, must cer^ 
tainly be more than sufficient to move it when there is no 
weight at all. 

Mr. Chubb sup|X)ses, that the will cannot stir at all 
without some motive ; and also supposes, that if there be 
a motive to one thing, and none to the contrary, volitioD 
will infallibly follow that motive. This is virtually to 
suppose an entire dependence of the will on motives ; if 
it were not wholly dependent on them, it could surely 
help itself a little without them, or help itself a little 
against a motive, without help from the strength and 
weight of a contrary motive. And yet his supposing that 
the will, when it has before it various opposite motives, 
can use them as it pleases, and choose its own influence 
from them, and neglect the strongest, and follow the 
weakest, supposes it to j>e wholly independent on motives. 
It further appears, on Mr. Chubb's supposition, that vo- 
lition must be without any previous ground in any motive, 
thus : if it be, as he supposes, that the will is not deter- 
mined by any previous superior strength of the motive, 



SECT. X. SCHEME OF LIBERTY, ETC. 137 

but determines aod chooses its own motive, then, when 
the rival motives are exactly equal in strength and ten- 
dency to induce in all respects, it may follow either ; and 
may in such a case sometimes follow one, sometimes the 
other. And if so, this divei-sity which appears between 
the acts of the will, is plainly without previous ground in 
either of the motives, for all that is previously in the mo* 
tives is supposed precisely and perfectly the same, without 
any diversity whatsoever. Now, perfect identity, as to all 
that is previous in the antecedent, cannot be the ground 
and reason of diversity in the consequent. Perfect identity 
in the ground cannot be a reason why it is not followed 
with the same consequence. And therefore the source of 
his diversity of consequence must be sought for elsewhere. 

And lastly, it may be observed, that however Mr. 
Chubb does much insist that no volition can take place 
without some motive to induce it, which previously dis- 
poses the mind to it ; yet, as he also insists that the mind, 
without reference to any superior strength of motives, 
picks and chooses for its motive to follow ; he himself 
herein plainly supposes, that with regard to the mind's 
preference of one motive l^efore another, it is not the mo- 
tive that disposes the will, but the will disposes itself to 
follow the motive. 

IV. Mr. Chubb supposes necessity to be utterly incon- 
sistent with og'enc^; and that to suppose a being to be 
an agent in that which is necessary, is a plain contradic- 
tion. At p. 311, and throughout his discourses on the 
subject of liberty, he supposes, that necessity cannot con- 
sist with agency, or freedom ; and that to suppose other- 
wise, is to make liberty and necessity, action and passion, 
the same thing. And so he seems to suppose, that there 

12* 



138 INCONSISTENCE OF MR. CHCBb's PART If. 

is no action, strictly speaking, but volition ; and that as to 
the effects of volition in body or mind, in themselves con- 
sidered, being necessary, they are said to be free, only as 
they are the effects of an act that is not necessary. 

And yet, according to him, volition itself is the tfftct 
of volition ; yea, every act of free volition : and therefore 
every act of free volition must, by what has now been 
observed from him, be necessary. That every act of free 
volition is itself the effect of volition, is abundantly sup- 
posed by him. In p. 341, he says, '< If a man is such a 
creature as I have proved him to be, that, is, if he has in 
him a power or liberty of doing either good or evil, and 
either of these is the subject of his own free choicci so 
that he might, if he had pleased, have chosen and 
done the contrary." — Here he supposes, all that is good 
or evil in man is the effect of his clioice ; and so that his 
good or evil choice itself is the effect of his pleasure or 
choice, in these words, he might, if he had pleased, havt 
CHOSEN the contrary. So in p. 356, '* Though it be 
highly reasonable, that a man should always choose the 
greater good, — yet he may, if he please, choose other- 
wise." Which is the same thing as if he had said, he may, 
if he chooses, choose otherwise. And then he goes on, 
— " that is, he may, if he pleases, choose what is good for 
himself," etc. And again, in the same page, '^ The will 
is not confined by the understanding to any particular sort 
of good, whether greater or less ; but is at liberty to choose 
what kind of good it pleases.^^ If there be any meaning 
in the last words, the meaning must be this, that the will 
is at liberty to choose what kind of good it chooses to 
choose ; supposing the act of choice itself determined by 
an antecedent choice. The liberty Mr. Chubb speaks of. 



8SCT. X. 8CH£Mfi OF LIBERTY, ETC. 139 

is not a roan's having power to move his body agreeably 
to an antecedent act of choice, but to use or exert the fac- 
ulties of his soul. Thus, in p, 379, speaking of the fac* 
ulties of his mind, he says, << Man has power, and is at lib- 
erty, to neglect these faculties, to use them aright, or to 
abuse them, o^ he pleases" And that he supposes an act 
of choice, or exercise of pleasure, properly distinct ^'rom, 
and antecedent tOy those acts thus chosen, directing, com- 
manding, and producing the chosen acts, and even the acts 
of choice themselves, is very plain in p. 283. ^' He can 
command his actionsy and herein consists his liberty ; he 
can give or deny himself that pleasure, as he pleases." 
And p. 377 : ^' If the actions of men are not the produce 
of a free choice, or election, but spring from a necessity 
of nature,^ — he cannot in reason be the object of reward or 
punishment on their account. Whereas, if action in man, 
whether good or evil, is the produce of will or free choicCy 
so that a man, in either case, had it in his power, and was 
at liberty, to have chosen the contrary ; he is the proper 
object of reward or punishment, according as he chooses 
to behave himself." Here, in these last words, he speaks 
of liberty of choosing, according as he chooses. So 
that the behaviour which he speaks of, as subject to his 
choice, is his choosing itself, as well as his external conduct 
consequent upon it. And therefore it is evident, he means 
^not only external actions, but the acts of choice themselves, 
when he speaks of all free actions as the produce of 
free choice. And this is abundantly evident in what he 
says in pp. 372, 373. 

Now these things imply a twofold great absurdity and 
inconsistence. 

1. To suppose, as Mr. Chubb plainly does, that every 



140 INCONSlSTENCfi OF MR. CHUBB^S PART It. 

free act of choice is commanded by, and is the produce of, 
free choice, is to suppose the first free act of choice be- 
longing to the case, yea, the first free act of choice that 
ever man exerted, to be the produce of an antecedent act 
of choice. But I hope I need not labour at all to con- 
vince my readers, that h is an absurdity to say, the very 
Jirst act is the produce of another act that went before it. 
2. If it were both possible and real, as Mr. Chubb in- 
sists, that every free act of choice were the produce x)r 
the eflfect of a free act of choice ; yet even then, accord- 
ing to his principles, no one act of choice would be free, 
but every one necessary ; because, every act of choice 
being the efiect of a foregoing act, every act would be ne- 
cessarily connected with that foregoing cause. For Mr. 
Chubb himself says, p. 389, " When the self-moving 
power is exerted, it becomes the necessary cause of its 
effects." — So that his notion of a free act, that is reward- 
able or punishable, is a heap of contradictions. It is a 
free act, and yet, by his own notion of freedom, is neces- 
sary ; and therefore by him it is a contradiction to sup- 
pose it to be free. According to him, every free act is 
the produce of a free act ; so that there must be an infi- 
nite number of free acts in succession, without any begin- 
ning, in an agent that has a beginning. And therefore 
here is an infinite number of free acts, every one of thera 
free ; and yet not any one of them free, but every act in. 
the whole infinite chain a necessary effect. All the acts 
are rewardable or punishable, and yet the agent cannot, 
in reason, be the object of reward or punishment, on ac- 
count of any one of these actions. He is active in them 
all, and passive in none ; yet active in none, but passive 
in all^ etc. 



SECT* X. SCHEME OF LIBERTT, ETC. 141 

y. Mr. Chubb does most strenuously deny that mo- 
tives are causes of the acts of the will ; or that the mov- 
ing principle in roan is movedy or caused to be exerted^ by 
motives. His words, pp. 388, 369, are, " If the moving 
principle in man is- moved, or caused to be exerted, 
by something external to man, which all motives are, 
then it would not be a self-moving principle, seeing it 
would be moved by a principle external to itself. And 
to say, that a self-moving principle is moved, or caused 
to be exerted, by a cause external to itself, id absurd 
and a contradiction," etc. — And in the next page it is par- 
ticularly and largely insisted, that motives are causes in no 
case, that they are merely passive in the production of ac* 
tion^ and have no causality in the production of it — no 
causality to be the caiLse of the exertion of the will. 

Now I desire it may be considered, how this can pos- 
sibly consist with what be says io other places. Let it 
be noted here, 

1. Mr. Chubb abundantly speaks of motives as excite^ 
ments of the acts of the will ; and says, that motives do 
excite volition, and induce it, and that they are necessary 
to this end ; that in the reason and nature of things, vo- 
lition cannot take place without motives to excite it. But 
now, if motives excite the will, they move it ; and yet he 
says, it is absurd to say the will is moved by motives. 
And again (if language is of any significancy at all), if 
motives excite volition, then they are the came of its be- 
ing excited ; and to cause volition to be excited, is to 
cause it to be put forth or exerted. Yea, Mr. Chubb 
says himself, p. 317, motive is necessary to the exertion 
of the active faculty. To excite, is positively to do some- 
thing ; and cectainly that which does something, is the 



142 INCONSISTENCE OF MR. CHUBB's PART II. 

cause of the thing done by it. To create, is to cause to 
be created ; to make, is to cause to be made ; to kill, is to 
cause to be killed ; to quicken, is to cause to be quickened ; 
and to excite is to cause to be excited. To excite, is to 
be a cause, in the most proper sense ; not merely a neg- 
ative occasion, but a ground of existence by positive in- 
fluence. The notion of exciting^ is exerting influence to 
cause the eflfect to arise or come forth into existencef. 

2. Mr. Chubb himself, p. 317, speaks of motives as the 
ground and reason of action by influence, and bt pre- 
vailing INFLUENCE. Now, what can be meant by a 
cause, but something that is the ground and reason of a 
thing by its influence, an influence that is prevalent, and 
so effectual ? 

3. This author not only speaks of motives as the ground 
and reason of action, by prevailing influence ; but express- 
ly of their influence as prevailing for the production 
of an action, in the same page (317) : which makes the 
inconsistency still more palpable and notorious. The pro- 
duction of an effect is certainly the causing of an effect; 
and productive influence is causal influence, if any thing 
is ; and that which has this influence prevalently, so as 
thereby to become the ground of another thing, is a cause 
of that thing, if there be any such thing as a cause. This 
influence, Mr. Chubb says, motives have to produce an 
action ; and yet, he says it is absurd and a contradiction 
to say they are causes. 

4. In the same page, he once and again speaks of mo- 
tives as disposing the agent to action, by their influence. 
His words are these : " As motive, which takes place in 
the understanding, and is the product of intelligence, is 
necessary to action, that is, to the exertion of the ac- 



SECT. X. SCHEME OF LIBERTY, ETC. 143 

tire faculty, because that faculty would not be exerted 
without some previous reason to dispose the mind to 
action ; so from hence it plainly appears, that when a 
man is said to be disposed to one action rather another, 
this properly signifies the prevailing influence that 
one motive has upon a roan for the production of an 
action, or for the being at rest, before all other motives for 
the production of the contrary. For as motive is the 
ground and reason of any action, so the motive that pre- 
vaihy DISPOSES the agent to the performance of that 
action. 

Now, if motives dispose the mind to action, then they 
cause the mind to be disposed ; and to cause the mind to 
be disposed, is to cause it to be willing ; and to cause it 
to be willing, is to cause it to will ; and that is the same 
thing as to be the cause of an act of the will. And yet 
this same Mr. Chubb holds it to be absurd to suppose 
motive tp be a cause of the act of the will. 

And if we compare these things together, we have here 
again a whole heap of inconsistences. Motives are the 
previous ground and reason of the acts of the will ; yea, 
the necessary ground and reason of their exertion, without 
which they will not be exerted, and cannot, in the nature 
of things, take place ; eLXid they do excite these acts of 
the will, and do this by a prevailing influence ; yea, an 
influence which prevails for the production of the act of 
the will, and for the disposing of the mind to it ; and yet 
it is absurd to suppose motive to be a cause of an act of the 
will, or that a principle of will is moved or caused to be 
exerted by it, or that it has any causality in the produce 
tion of it, or any causality to be the cause of the exertion 
of the mil. 



144 , GOD CERTAINLY FOREKNOWS PART II. 

A due consideration of these things which Mr Chubb 
has advanced, the strange inconsistences which the notion 
of liberty, consisting in the will's power of self-determina- 
tion void of all necessity, united with that dictate of com- 
mon sense, that there can be no volition without a motive, 
drove him into, may be sufficient to convince us, that it 
is utterly impossible ever to make that notion of liberty 
consistent with the influence of motives in volition. And 
as it is in a manner self-evident, that there can be no act 
of will, choice, or preference of the mind, without some 
motive or inducement, something in the mind's view, which 
it aims at, seeks, inclines to, and goes after ; so it is most 
manifest, there is no such liberty in the universe as the 
Arminians insist on ; nor any such thing possible or con- 
ceivable. 

SECTION XI. 

THE EVIDENCE OF GOD^S CERTAIN FOREKNOWLEDGE OF THE 

VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. 

That the acts of the wills of moral agents are not con- 
tingent events, in that sense as to be without all necessity, 
appears by God's certain foreknowledge of such events. 

In handling this argument, I would in the first place 
prove that God has a certain foreknowledge of the volun- 
tary acts of moral agents ; and secondly ^ shew the conse- 
quence, or how it follows from hence, that the volitions 
of moral agents are not contingent, so as to be without ne- 
cessity of connection and consequence. 

First, I am to prove, that God has an absolute and cer- 
tain foreknowledge of the free actions of moral agents. 

One would think it should be wholly needless to enter 



SKCT. XI* THS TOLITIOKS OJT MOEAL AGSNTS. I4S 

on such an argument with any that profess themselres 
Christians : but so it is ; God's certain foreknowledge of 
the free acts of moral agents, is denied by some that pre- 
tend to believe the Scriptures to be the word of God ; and 
especially of late. I therefore shall consider the evidence 
of such a prescience in the Most High, as fully as the de* 
signed limits of this essay will admit of; supposing myself 
herein to have to do with such as own the truth of the 
Bible. 

Arg. L My firzt argument shall be taken from God's 
prediction of such events. Here I would, in tiie first place, 
lay down these two things as axioms. 

1. If God does not foreknow, he cannot foretell such 
events ; that is, he cannot peremptorily and certainly fore-7 
tell them. If God has no more than an uncertain guess/ 
concerning events of this kind, then he can declare noV 
more than an uncertain guess. Positively to foretell, is / 
to profess to foreknow, or declare positive foreknowledge. 

2. If God does not certainly foreknow the future voli- 
tibns of moral agents, then neither can he certainly fore- \ 
know those events which arc consequent and dependent \ 
on these volitions. The existence of the one depending / 
on the existence of the other, the knowledge of the exis-y 
tence of the one depends on the knowledge of the exil^ 
tence of the other ; and the one cannot be more certain . 
than the other. 

Therefore, how many, how great, and how extensive 
soever the consequences of the volitions of moral agents 
may be ; though they slK>uld extend to an alteration of the 
state of things through the universe, and should be contin- 
ued in a series of successive events to all eternity, and 
should, in the progress of things, branch forth into an ioS- 

13 



146 GOD CERTAINLY FOREKNOWS PARI* II. 

nite number of series, each of them going on in an endless 
line or chain of events ; God must be as ignorant of all these 
consequences, as he is of the volition whence they first 
take their rise : ail these events, and the whole state of 
things depending on them, how important, extensive, and 
vast soever, must be hid from him. 

These positions being such as, I suppose, none will 
deny, I now proceed to observe the following things. 

1. Men's moral conduct and qualities, their virtues and 
vices> their wickedness and good practice, things reward- 
able and punishable, have often been foretold by God. — 
Pharaoh's moral conduct, in refusing to obey God's com- 
mand, in letting his people go, was foretold. God says to 
Moses, Exod. iii. 19, '* I am sure that the king of Egypt 
will not let you go." Here God professes not only to 
guess at, but to know, Pharaoh's future disobedience. In 
chap. viii. 4, God says, ^' but Pharaoh shall not hearken 
unto you ; that I may lay mine hand upon Egypt," etc. 
And chap. ix. 30, Moses says to Pharaoh, ^' as for thee, 
and thy servants, I know that ye will not fear the Lord." 
See also chap. xi. 9. — The moral conduct of Josiah, by 
name, in his zealously exerting himself in opposition to 
idolatry, in particular acts of his, was foretold above three 
hundred years before he was born, and the prophecy 
sealed by a miracle, and renewed and confirmed by the 
words of a second prophet, as what surely would not fail, 
1 Kings, xiii. I — 6, 32. This prophecy was also in ef- 
fect a prediction of the moral conduct of the people, in 
upholding their scbismatical and idolatrous worship until 
that time, and the idolatry of those priests of the high 
places, which it is foretold Josiqh should offer upon that 
altar of Bethel.-.-Micaiah foretold the foolish and sinful 



8JBCT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. 147 

conduct of Abab ia refusing to hearken to the word of 
the Lord by him, and choosing rather to hearken to the 
fiilse prophets, in going to Ramoth-Gilead to his ruin, 1 
Kings xxi. 20 — 5i2. The moral conduct of Hazael was 
foretold, in that cruelty he should be guilty of; on which 
Hazael says, <' what, is thy servant a dog, that he should 
do this thing?'' The prophet speaks of the event as 
what he knew, and not what he conjectured, 2 Kings 
viii. 12, '^ I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the 
children of Israel: thou wilt dash their children, and rip 
up their women with child." The moral conduct of 
Cyrus is foretold long before he had a being, in his mercy 
to God's people, and regard to the true God, in turning 
the captivity of the Jews, and promoting the building of 
the temple, Isai. xliv. 28, and Ixv. 13. Compare 2 Chron. 
xxxvi. 22, 23, and Ezra i. 1—4. How many instances 
of the moral conduct of the kings of the north and south, 
particular instances of the wicked behavior of the kings 
of Syria and Egypt, are foretold in the 1 1th chapter of 
Daniel? their corruption, violence, robbery, treachery, 
and lies. And particularly, how much is foretold of the 
horrid wickedness of Antiochus Epiphanes, called there 
a vile person^ instead of Epiphanes, or illustrious. In 
that chapter, and also in chap. viii. ver. 9, 14, 23, to the 
^nd, are foretold his flattery, deceit, and lies, his having 
Am heart set to do mischiefs and set against the holy coi?« 
enanty bis destroying and treading under foot the holy 
people, in a marvellous manner, his having indignation 
against the holy covenant, setting his heart against it, 
and conspiring against it, his polluting the sanctuary of 
strength, treading it under foot, taking away the daily 
sacrifice, and placing the abomination that majceih deso^ 



148 OOD CEBTAINLT FOREKNOWS PART II. 

late ; bis great pride, magnifying himself against Oodj 
and uttering marvellous blasphemies against Am, until 
God ID indignation should destroy him. Witbal, the 
moral conduct of the Jews, on occasion of his persecution, 
is predicted. It is foretold, that '* be should corrupt 
many by flatteries," chap. xi. 32 — 34. But that others 
should behave with a glorious constancy and fortitude, in 
opposition to him, ver. 32. And that some good men 
should fall and repent, ver. 35. Christ foretold Peter's 
sin in denying his Liord, with its circumstances, in a per* 
emptory manner. And so that great sin of Judas in be* 
traying his Master, and its dreadful and eternal punish* 
ment in hell, was foretold in the like positive manner. 
Matt. xxvi. 21-^25, and parallel places in the other 
Evangelists. 

2. Many events have been foretold by God, which are 
consequent and dependent on the moral conduct of par* 
ticttlar persons, and were accomplished either by their 
virtuous or vicious actions. Thus, the children of Israel's 
going down into Egypt to dwell there, was foretold to 
Abraham, Gen. xv., which was brought about by the 
wickedness of Joseph's brethren in selling him, and the 
wickedness of Joseph's mistress, and his' own signal virtue 
in resisting her temptation. The accomplishment of the 
thing prefigured in Joseph's dream, depended on the 
same moral conduct. -Jotbam's parable and prophecy, 
Judges IX. 15 — 20, was accomplished by the wicked 
conduct of Abimelech and the men of Sbechem. The 
prophecies against the house of Eli, 1 Sam. chap. ii. and 
iii. were accomplished by the wickedness of Doeg the 
Edomite in accusing the priests, and the great impiety 
and extreme cruelty of Saul in destroying the priests at 



8KCT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. 149 

Nob, 1 Sam. xxii. Nathan's prophecy against David, 2 
Sam. xii. 11, 12, was fulfilled by the horrible wickedness 
of Absalom, in rebelling against bis father, seeking his life, 
and lying with his concubines in the sight of the sun. 
The prophecy against Solomon, 1 Kings xi. 11 — 13, 
was ful611ed by Jeroboam's rebellion and usurpation, 
which are spoken of as his wickedness, 2 Chron. xiii. 5, 
6, compare ver. 18. The prophecy against Jeroboam's 
family, 1 Kings xiv. was fulfilled by the conspiracy, 
treason, and cruel murders of Baasha, 2 Kings, xv. 27, 
etc. The predictions of the prophet Jehu against the 
house of Baasha, I Kings, xvi. at the beginning, were 
fulfilled by the treason and parricide of Ziniri, I Kings, 
xvi. 9—13, 20. 

3. How often has God foretold the future moral con* 
dtict of nations and people, of numbers, bodies, and suc- 
cessions of men ; with God's judicial proceedings, and 
many other events consequent and dependent on their 
virtues and vices; which could not be foreknown, if the 
volitions of men, wherein they acted as moral agents, had 
not been foreseen? The future cruelty of the Egyptians 
in oppressing Israel, and God's judging and punishing 
them for it, was foretold long before it came to pass, Gen. 
XV. 13, 14. The continuance of the iniquity of the 
Amorites, and the increase of it until it should be full, 
and they ripe for destruction, was foretold above four 
^ hundred years beforehand, Gen. xv. 16. Acts vii. 6, 7 
The prophecies of the destruction of Jemsalem and the 
land of Judab, were absolute; 2 Kings xx 17 — 19. 
chap. xxii. 15, to the end. It was foretold in Hezekiah's 
time, and was abundantly insisted on in the book of the 
prophet Isaiah, who wrote nothing after Hezekiab's days.

150 GOD GERTAtNLY FOREKNOWS PART II. 

It, was foretold in Josiah's time in the beginning of a great 
reforination, 2 Kings xxii. And it is manifest by innu- 
merable things in the prediction of the prophets, relating 
to this event, its time, its circumstances, its continuance 
and end ; the return from the captivity, the restoration of 
the temple, city, and land, and many circumstances and 
consequences of that ; I say, these show plainly that the 
prophecies of this great event were absolute. And yet 
this event was connected with, and dependent on, two 
things in men's moral conduct : first, the injurious rapine 
and violence of the king of Babylon and his people, as the 
efficient cause ; which God often speaks of as what he 
highly resented, and would severely punish : and, second- 
ly, the final obstinacy of the Jews. That great event is of- 
ten spoken of as suspended on this, Jer. iv. 1, and v. I. 
vii. 1 — ^7. xi. 1 — 6. xvii. 24, to the end, xxv. 1 — 1, 
xxvi. 1 — 8, 13, and xxxviii. 17, 18. Therefore this 
destruction and captivity could not be foreknown, unless 
such a moral conduct of the Chaldeans and Jews had 
been foreknown. And then it was foretold, that the peo- 
ple should be finally obstinate, to the destruction and ut- 
ter desolation of the city and land. Isai. vi. 9 — 1 1 . Jer. 
i. 18, 19. vii. 27, 29. Ezek. iii. 7, and xxiv. 13, 14. 

The final obstinacy of those Jews who were left in the 
land of Israel, in their idolatry and rejection of the true 
God, was foretold by God, and the prediction confirmed 
with an oath, Jer. xliv. 26, 27. And God tells the people 
Isai. xlviii. 3,4 — 8, that he had predicted those things 
which should be consequent on their treachery and obstina- 
cy because he knew they would be obstinate ; and that he 
had declared these things beforehand, for their conviction 
of his being the only true God, etc. 



SBCT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. 151 

Tlie destructioo of Babylon, with many' of the circum- 
lances of it, was foretold, as the judgment of God for the 
exceeding pride and haughtiness of the heads of that mon- 
archy. Nebuchadnezzar, and his successors, and their 
wickedly destroying other nations, and particularly for their 
exalting themselves against the true God and his people, 
before any of these monarchs had a being ; Isai. chap. xiii. 
xiv. xlvii. : compare Habakkuk ii. 5, to the end, and Jer. 
chap. 1. and li. That Babylon's destruction was to be a 
'' recompense, according to the works of their own hands," 
appears by Jer. xxv. 14. The immorality which the peo- 
ple of Babylon, and particularly her princes and great men, 
were guilty of, that very night that the city was destroyed, 
their revelling and drunkenness at Belshazzar's idolatrous 
feast, was foretold, Jer. li. 39, 57. 

The return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity ia 
often very particularly foretold, with many circumstances, 
and the promises of it are very peremptory ; Jer. xxxi. 
35—40, and xxxii. 6 — 15, 41—44, and xxxiii. 24 — 26. 
And the very time of their return was prefixed ; Jer. xxv. 
11, 12. xxix. 10, 11. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 21. Ezek. iv. 6 
and Dan. ix 2. And yet the prophecies represent their 
return as consequent on their repentance. And their re-, 
pentance itself is very expressly and particularly foretold, 
Jer. xxix. 12, 13, 14. xxxi. 8, 9, 18 — ^31. xxxiii. 8. I. 
4, 5. Ezek. vi. 8, 9, 10. vii. 16. xiv. 22, 23, and xx. 43, 
44. 

It was foretold, under the Old Testament, that the Mes- 
siah should suffer greatly through the malice and cruelty 
of men ; as is largely and fully set forth, Psal. xxii, ap- 
plied to Christ in the New Testament, Matt, xxvii. 35, 
43. Luke xxiii. 34. John xix. 24. Heb. ii. 12. And 



153 GOD CERTAINLY FOREKNOWS PART II. 

likewise id Psah Ixix. which, it is also evident by the New 
Testament, is spoken of Christ ; John xv. 25. vii. 5, etc. 
and it. 17. Ronu xv. 3. Matt, xxvii. 34, 48. Mark xv. 
23. John xix. 29. The same thing is also foretold, Isai. 
liii. and 1. 6, and Mic. v. 1. This cruelty of men was 
their sin, and what they acted as moral agents. It was 
foretold, that there should be an union of heathea and Jew- 
ish nilers against Christ, Psal. ti. 1, 2, compared with 
Acts iv. 25—28. It was foretold, that the Jews should 
generally reject and despise the Messiah, Isai. xlix. 5, 6, 
7, and liii. 1 — 3. Ps. xxii. 6, 7, and Ixix. 4, 8,19, 20. And 
it was foretold, tliat the body of that nation should be rejeo- 
ted in the Messiah's days, from being God's people, for 
their obstinacy in sin; Isai. xlix. 4 — 7, and viii. 14, 15, 
16, compared with Rom. x. 19, and Isai. Ixv. at the begin* 
ning, compared with Rom. x. 20, 21. It was foretold, 
that Christ should be rejected by the chief priests and 
rulers among the Jews, Psalm cxviii. 22, compared with 
Matt. xxi. 42. Acts iv. 11. 1 Pet. ii. 4, 7. 

Christ himself foretold his being delivered into the hands 
of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and his being cm- 
eily treated by them and condemned to death ; and that 
he by them should be delivered to the OentiUs ; and that 
he should be mocked and scourged and crucified^ (Matt* 
xvi. 21, and xx. 17 — 19. Luke ix. 22. John viii. 28)^ 
and that the people should be concerned in and consenting 
to his death (Luke xx. 13 — 18), especially the inhabi- 
tants of Jerusalem ; Luke xiii. 33 — 35. He foretold, that 
the disciples should all be offended because of him that 
night that he was betrayed, and should forsake htm ; Matt, 
xxvi. 31. John xvi. 32. He foretold, that he should be 
rejected of that generation, even the body of the people. 



8KCT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGCNTS. 153 

dnd that they should continue obstinate, to their ruin ; 
Matt. xii. 45. xxi. 33 — 42, and xxii. i — 1. Luke xiii. 
16, 21, 24. xvii. 25. xix, 14,27, 41—44. xx. 13—18, 
and xxiii. 34 — 39. 

As it was foretold in both Old Testament and New, 
that the Jews should reject the Messiah, so it was fore- 
told that the Gentiles should receive him, and so be ad- 
mitted to the privileges of God's people : in places too 
many to be now particularly mentioned. It was foretold 
in the Old Testament, that the Jews should envy the 
Gentiles on this account ; Deut. xxxii. 21 , compared with 
Rom. X. 19. Christ himself often foretold, that the Gen* 
tiles would embrace the true religion, and become his fol- 
lowers and people; Matt. viii. 10, 11, 12. xxi. 41 — 43, 
and xxii. 8 — 10. Luke xiii. 28. xiv. 16 — 24, and xx. 
16» John, X. 16. He also foretold the Jews' envy of the 
Gentiles on this occasion ; Matt. xx. 12 — 16. Luke, xv. 
26, to the end. H« foretold, that they should continue 
HI this opposition and envy, and should manifest it in the 
cruel persecutions of his followers, to their utter destruc- 
tion ; Matt. xxi. 33-^42. xxii. 6, and xxiii. 34-^9. 
Luke xi. 49 — 51. The Jews' obstinacy is also foretold, 
Acts xxii. 18. Christ often foretold the great persecu* 
tions his followers should meet with, both from Jews and 
Gentiles; Matt. x. 16—18, 21, 22, 34—36, and xxiv. 
9. Mark xiii. 9. Luke x. 3. xii. 11, 49 — 53, and xxi. 
12, 16, 17. John xv. 18—21, and xvi. 1 — 4, 20—22, 
23. He foretold the martyrdom of particular persons ; 
Matt. XX. 23. John xiii. 36, and xxi. 18, 19, 22. H« 
foretold the great success of the Gospel in the city of Sa- 
maria, as near approaching ; which afterwards was fulBl- 
led by the preaching of Philip ; John iv. 3&*-^8. He 



154 QOD CERTAINLY FOREKNOWS PART II. 

foretold the rising of many deceivers after liis departure, 
Matt. xxiv. 4, 5y 11, and the apostasy of many of bis 
professed followers, Matt. xxiv. 10 — 12. 

The persecutions which the apostle Paul was to meet 
with in the world, were foretold ; Acts ix. 16. xx. 23> 
and xxi. 11. The apostle says to the Christian Epbe- 
sians, Acts xx. 29, 30, ^< I know, that after my depart^ 
ure shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing 
the flock : also of your own selves shall men arise, speak- 
ing perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." 
The apostle says, he knew this : but he did not know it, 
if God did not know the future actk>ns of moral agents* 

4. Unless God foreknows the future acts of moral 
agents, all the prophecies we have in Scripture concern- 
ing the great antichristian apostasy ; the rise, reign, wick* 
ed qualities, and deeds, of the man of sin, and his instru- 
ments and adherents ; the extent and long continuance of 
his dominion, his influence on the minds of princes and 
others, to corrupt them, and draw them away to idol- 
atry and other foul vices ; bis great and cruel persecu- 
tions ; the behavior of the saints under these great tempta^* 
tions, etc. I say, unless the volitions of moral agents are 
foreseen, all these prophecies are uttered without know- 
ing the things foretold. 

The predictions relating to this great apostasy are all of 
a moral nature, relating to men's virtues and vices, avd their 
exercises, fruits and consequences, and events depending 
on them ; and are very particular ; and most of them of- 
ten repeated, with many precise characteristics, descrip- 
tions, and limitations of qualities, conduct, influence, ef- 
fects, extent, duration, periods, circumstances, final issue, 
etc., which it would be very long to mention particularly. 



8BCT. XI. turn V0LITI0K8 OF MORAL AGEKTS. 155 

And to suppose a]l these efiects are predicted by God 
without any certain knowledge of the future moral beha- 
vior of free agents, would be to the utmost degree absurd. 
5. Unless God foreknows the future acts of men's wills, 
and their behavior as moral agents, all those great things 
which are foretold in both Old Testament and New con- 
cerning the erection, establishment, and universal extent 
of the kingdom of the Messiah^ were predicted and pro- 
mised while God was in ignorance whether any of these 
things would come to pass or no,, and did but guess at 
them. For that kingdom is not of tliis world, it does not 
consist in things external, but is within men, and consists 
in the dominion of virtue in their hearts, in righteousness, 
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost ; and in these things 
made manifest in practice, to the praise and glory of God. 
The Messiah came to save men from their sinsy and de- 
liver them from their spiritual enemies ; that they might 
serve him in righteousness and holiness before him : he 
gave himself for ««, that he might redeem us from all in- 
iquity ^ and purify unto himself a peculiar people^ zeaU 
ous of good works > And therefore his success consists in 
gaining men's hearts to virtue, in their being made Ood*s 
willing people in the day of his power. His conquest, of 
his enemies consists in his victory over men's corruptions 
and vices. And such success, such victory, and such a 
reign and dominion, is often expressly foretold : that his 
kingdom shall f II the earth : that all people ^ nations, and 
languages, should serve and obey him : and so that all 
nations should go up to the mountain of the house of the 
Lord, that he might teach them his ways, and that they 
mighfwalk in his paths ; and that all men should be drawn 
to Christ, and the earth be full of the knowledge of the 



156 GOD CKETAINLT rOAKKNOWS PART II. 

Lord (by which, in |he style of Scripture, is meant true 
virtue and religion,) as the waters cover the seas ; that 
ChMTs law should be put into men^s inward parts, and 
written in their hearts ; and that Qod*s people should be 
all righteousy etc., etc. 

A very great part of the prophecies of the Old Testa* 
ment is taken up in such predictions as these. — And here 
I would observe, that the prophecies of the universal pre- 
valence of the kingdom of the Messiah, and true religion 
of Jesus Christ, are delivered in.the most peremptory man* 
ner, and confirmee^ by the oath of God, Isai. xlv. 22, to 
the end, '* Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends 
of the earth ; for I aip God, and there is none else. I 
have sWoRN by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth 
in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every 
knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear. Surblt, 
shall one say. In the Lord have I righteousness and 
strength : even to him shall men come,'! etc. But her^ 
this peremptory declaration, and great oath of the Most 
High, are delivered with such mighty solemnity to things 
which God did not know, if he did not certainly foresee 
the volitions of moral agents. 

And all the predictions of Christ and his apostles, to 
the like purpose, must be without knowledge : as those 
of our Saviour comparing the^kingdom of God to a grain 
of mustard-seed, growing exceeding great from a small 
beginning; and to leaven, hid in three measures of meal 
until the whole was leayened, etc. — And the prophecies 
in the epistles concerning the restoration of the nation of 
the Jews to the true church of God, and the bringing in 
the fulness of the Gentiles ; and the prophecies in all the 
Revelation concerning the glorious change in the moral 



BttCt. XI. tnz VOUTkONft 6r itOltAL A«£NTd. 157 

state of the world of mankind, attending the deslructioo 
of antichrist, the kingdoms of the world becomhig the 
kingdoms of*yur Lord and. of his Christ; apd its being 
granted to the church to be arrayed in that fine Knen^ 
white and clean^ which is the righteovsness of saints^ etc. 

Corol. 1. Hence that great promise and oatii of God 
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so much celebrated in 
Scripture, both in the Old Testament and New, namely, 
That in their seed all the nations and families of the 
earth should be blessed, must be made on uncertainties, if 
God does not certainly foreknow the volitions of moral 
agents. For the fulfilment of this promise consists in that 
success of Christ in the work of redemption, and that set* 
ting up of his spiritual kingdom over the nations of the 
world, wbk^h has been spoken of. Men are blessed in 
Christ no otherwise than as they are brought to acknow- 
ledge him, trust in iiirn, love and serve him, as is repre- 
sented and predicted in Psal. Ixxii. 11,^* All kings shall 
fall down before him ; all nations shall serve him." Willi 
ver. 17, '^ Men shall be blessed in him; all natiohs shall 
call him blessed." This oath to Jacob and Abraham is 
fulfilled in subduing men's iniquities ; as is implied in that 
of the prophet Micah, chap. vii. 19, 20. 

Corol. 2. Hence also it appears, that first gospel-prom- 
be that ever was made to mankind, that great prediction 
of the salvation of the Messiah, and his victory over Satan, 
made to our first parents, Gen. iii. 15, if there be no cer- 
tain prescience of the volitions of moral agents, must have 
no better foundation than' conjecture. For Christ's vic- 
tory over Satan consists in men's being saved from sin, 
and in the vicioiy of virtue and holiness, over that vice 



14 



158 GOD CEETAINLT FOREKNOWa PART If. 

and wickedness, which Satan by his temptation has inUo* 
ducedy and wherein his kingdom consists. 

6. If it be so, that God has not a prescience of the fu- 
ture actions of moral agents, it will follow, that the pro* 
phecies of Scripture in general ar^ without foreknow* 
ledge. For Scripture prophecies,^almost all of them, if 
not universally without any exception, are either predic- 
tions of the actings and behaviors of moral agents, or of 
events depending on them, or some way connected with 
them ; judicial dispensations, judgments on men for their 
wickedness, or rewards of virtue and righteousness, re- 
markable manifestations of favor to the righteous, or mani- 
festations of sovereign mercy to sinners, forgiving their 
iniquities, and magnifying the riches of Divine grace ; or 
dispensations of providence, in some respect or other, re- 
lating to the conduct of the subjects of God's moral gov- 
ernment, wisely adapted thereto ; either providing for 
what should be in a future state of things, through the 
volitions and voluntary actions of moral agents, or conse- 
quent upon them, and regulated and ordered according to 
them. So that all events that are foretold, are either 
moral events, or other events which are connected with, 
and accommodated to, moral events. 

That the predictions of Scripture in general must be 
without knowledge, if God does not foresee the volitions 
of men, will further appear, if it be considered, that almost 
Ull events belonging to the future state of the world of man- 
kind^) the changes and revolutions which come to pass in 
empires, kingdoms, and nations, and all societies, depend 
innumerable ways on the acts of men's wills ; yea, on an 
innumerable multitude of millions of millions of volitions

SHCT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AOENTS. 159 

of mankind. Such is the state and course of things in the 
world of mankind, that one Single event, which appears 
in itself exceeding inconsiderable, may, in the progress 
and series of things, occasion a succession of the greatest 
and most important and extensive events ; causing the 
state of mankind to be vastly different from what it would 
otherwise have been, for all succeeding generations. 

For instance, the coming into existence of those par- 
ticular men, who have been the great conquerors of the 
world, which, under God, have had the main band in all 
the consequent state of the world in all after ages ; such 
as Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander, Pompey, Julius 
Caesar, etc., undoubtedly depended on many millions of 
acts of the will, which followed and were occasioned one 
by another, in their parents. And perhaps most of these 
volitions depended on millions of volitions of hundreds and 
thousands of othei-s, their contemporaries of the same gen- 
eration ; and most of these on millions of millions of voli- 
tions of others in preceding generations. — As we go back, 
still the number of volitions, which were somB way the 
occasion of the event, multiply as the branches of a river, 
until they come at last, as it were, to an infinite number. 
This will not seem strange to any one who well considers 
the matter ; if we recollect what philosophers tell us of 
the innumerable multitudes of those things whibh are, as 
it were, the principioy or $tamina vita^ concerned in gen- 
eration ; the animalcula in semen masculo, and the ova in 
the womb of the female ; the impregnation, or animating 
of one of these in distinction from all the rest^ must de- 
pend on things infinitely minute, relating to the time and 
circumstances of the act of the parents, the state of their 
bodies, etc., which must depend on innumerable foregoing 



160 GOD CERTAINLY FORCKNOWS PART tf. 

circunistances and occurrences ; which nHist depend, in* 
fioite ways, on foregoing acts of their wills ; which are oe« 
casioned by innumerable things that happen in the coarse 
of their lives, in which their own, and their neighbors' be- 
havior, roust have a hand an infinite number of ways. 
And as the volitions ofothers must be so many ways con* 
cerned in the conception and birtli of such men ; so, no less 
in their preservation, and circumstances of life, their par* 
ticular determinations and actions, on which the great 
revolutions they were the occasion of, depended. As, for 
instance, wlien the conspirators in Persia against the Ma- 
gi; were consulting about a succession to the empire, it 
eame into the mind of one of them to propose, that he 
whose hoi-se neighed first, when they came together the 
next morning, should be king. Now such a thing's com- 
log into his mind, might depend on innumerable incidents^ 
wherein the volitions of mankind had been concerned* 
But, in consequence of this accident, Darius the son of 
Hystaspes, was king. And if this liad not been, probab- 
ly his successor would not have been the same^ and all 
the circuiT>stances of the Persian empire intglit have been 
fer otherwise. And then perhaps Alexander might never 
have conquered tiiat empire.. And then probably the cir- 
cumstances of the world in all succeeding ages, might 
have been vastly otherwise. I might further instance iu 
many other occurrences ; such as those on which depend- 
ed Alexander's preservation in the many critical junc- 
tures of his life, wherein a small trifle would have turned 
the scale against him ; and the preservation and success 
of the Roman people in the infancy of their kingdom and 
commonwealth, and afterwards ; which all the succeed-* 
tng changes in their state, and the mighty revoUuions that 



SECT. XI. TUB VOL1TIOH8 OV MOBAI, AGENTS. 16J 

I 

afterwards came to pass in the habitable world, depended 
upon. But these hints may be sufficient for every dis- 
cemiiig considerate person, to convince him, that the' 
whole state of the world of mankind, in all ages, and the t 
very being of every person who has ever lived in it, in ( 
every age, since the times of the ancient propiiets, has | 
depended on more volitions, or acts of the wills of men, J 
than there are sands on the sea-shore. 

And therefore, unless God does most exactly and per^ 
fectly foresee the future acts of men's wills, all the predic- 
tions which he ever uttered concerning David, Hezekiah, 
Josiab, Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander ; concerning 
the four monarchies, and the revolutions in them ; and 
concerning all the wars, commotions, victories, prosperi- 
ties, and calamities, of any of the kingdoms, nations, oi* 
communities, of the world, have all be^n without know- 
ledge. 

So that, according to this notion of God's not foresee- 
ing the volitions and free actions of men, God could foi-e- 
see nothing appertaining to the state of the world of man- 
kind in future ages ; not so much as the being of one per- 
son that should live in it ; and could foreknow no event*, 
but only such as he would bring to pass himself by the 
extraordinary interposition of his immediate power; or 
things which should come to pass in the natural material 
world, by the laws of motion, and course of nature, where- 
in that is independent on the actions or works of mankind : 
that is, as he might, like a very able mathematician and 
astronomer, with great exactness calculate the revolutions 
of the heavenly bodies, and the greater Wheels of the ma- 
'ehine of the external creation. 

And if we closely consider the matter, there will a|^ 

14* 



162 GOO CratTAIflLr ronXKftOWM fART II. 

pear reason to convince us, ftiat he could not^ with any 
absolute certainty, foresee even these. As to the Jirst, 
namely, tilings done by the immediate and extraordinary 
interposiiion of God's po^'er, these cannot be foreseeUy 
unless it can be foreseen when there shall be occasion for 
•ilch extraordintiry interposition. And that cSnnot be fore- 
aeen, unless the state of the moral world can be foreseen. 
For whenever God thus iriterposes, it is with regard lo the 
state of the moral world requiring such divine interposition. 
Thus, God could not certainly foresee the universal de- 
luge, the calling of Abraham, the destruction of Sodom and 
Gomorrah, the plagues on Egypt, and Israel's redemption 
out of it, the expelling the seven nations of Canaan, and 
the bringing brael into that land ; for these all are repre- 
sented as connected with things belonging to the state of 
the moral world. Nor can God foreknow the most pro- 
per and convenient time of ihe day of judgment and gen- 
eral conflagration ; for that chiefly depends on the course 
and state of things in the moral world. 

Nor, secondly^ can we on this supposition reasonably 
think, that God can certainly foresee what things shall 
come to pass, in the course of things, in the natural and 
material world, even those which in an ordinary state of 
things might be calculated by a good astronomer. For 
the moral world is the end of the natural world ; and the 
oourse of things in the former is undoubtedly subonlinate 
to God's designs with respect to the latter. Therefore be 
iias seen cause, from regard to the state of things in the 
moral world, extraordinarily to interpose, to interrupt and 
lay an arrest on the course of things in the natural world ; 
and even in the greater wheels of its motion, even so as 
to stop the sun in its course. And unless be can foresee 



/ 



SECT. XI. THC TOLITIOHS OF MOBAL AOSMTS. 163 

the volitions of men, and so know something of the future 
state of the moral world, be cannot know but that be may 
still have as great occasion to interpose in this manner, as 
ever he had : nor can he foresee bow, or when, he shall 
have occasion thus to interpose. 

Corol. 1. It appears from the things which have been 
observed, tjiat unless God foresees the volitions of moral 
agents, that cannot be true which is observed by the 
apostle James, Acts xv. 18, " Known unto God are all -^X<^ 
his works from the beginning of the world." 

Corol. 2. It appears from what has been observed, that 
unless God foreknows the volitions of moral agents, all the 
prophecies of Scripture have no better foundation than 
mere conjecture ; and ihaty in roost instances, a conjecture 
which must have the utmost uncertainty ; depending on 
an innumerable, and, as it were, infinite multitude of voli- 
tions, which are all, even to God, uncertain events : how- 
ever, these prophecies are delivered as absolute predic- 
tions, and very many of them in the most positive manner, 
with asseverations ; and some of them with the most so- 
lemn oaths. 

Corol. 3. It also follows, from what has been observed, 
that if this notion of God's ignorance of future volitions be 
true, in vain did Christ say (after uttering many great and 
important predictions concerning God's moral kingdom, 
and things depending on men's moral actions). Matt. xxrv. 
35, ^* Heaven and earth shall pass away ; but my wocds 
shall not pass away." 

Corol. 4. From the same notion of God's ignorance, 
it would follow, that in vain has God himself often spoken 
of the predictions of his word as evidences of foreknow* 
kdge ; and so as evidences of that which is his preroga- 



164 cioD cvETiiKLt roHEKNows :^Aiit in 

tive as God, and bis peculiar glory, greatly distinguishing 
him from all other beings ; as in Isai. xli. 22— S6. xliii. 
9, 10. xiiv. 8. xlv. 21. xlvi. 10. and xlvtii. 14. 

Arg. II. If God does not foreknow the volitions of 
moral agents, then he did not foreknow the fall of man, 
nor of angels, and so could not foreknow the ^reat things 
which are comequevU on these events ; such* as his send* 
ing his Son into the wofid to die for sinners, and all things 
pertaining to the great work of redemption ; all the things 
which were done for four thousand years before Christ 
came, to prepare the way for it ; and the incarnation, life, 
death, resurrection, and ascension, of Christ ; and the set* 
ting him at the head of the universe, as king of heaven and 
earth, angels and men ; and the setting up his church and 
kingdom in this world, and appointing him the judge of 
the world; and all that Satan should do in the world* in 
opposition to the kingdom of Christ: and the great trans- 
actions of the day of judgment, that men and devils shall 
be the subjects of, and angels concerned in ; they are all 
what God was ignorant of before the fall. And if so, the 
following Scriptures, and others like them, must be without 
any meaning, or contrary to truth* Eph. i. 4, '^According 
as be bath chosen us in him before the foundation of the 
world.*' 1 Pet. i. 20, *' Who verily was* foreordained be- 
fore the foundation of the world." 2 Tim. i. 9, '^ Who 
hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling ; not ac- 
cording to our works, but according to his own purpose 
and grace, which was given us in Chris* Jesus before the 
world began." So, Eph. iii. 11, (speaking of ttie wis- 
dom of God in the work of redemptioa), '' According to 
the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jt^sus." 
Tit. i. 2, '^ In hope of eternal life, which God, that can- 



nCT. XI. TH£ VOLtTlONS OF MOEAL A6BKTS. 166 

not lie, promised before the worldJbegan." Rotiu viii. 
29, '^ Wi)om he did foreknow, them he also did predes- 
tinate," etc. 1 Pet. i. 2, Elect, according to the fore* 
knowledge of God the Father." 

]f God did not foreknow the fall of man, nor the re- 
demption by Jesus Christ, nor the volitions of man since 
the fall ; then he did not foreknow the saints in any sense ; 
neither as particular persons, nor as societies or nations ; 
either by elect ion, or mere foresight of their virtue or good 
works ; or any foresight of anything about them relating 
to their salvation ; or any benefit they have by Christ, or 
any manner of concern of theirs with n Redeemer. 

Arg. III. On the supposition of God's ignorance of the 
futtire volitions of free agents, it will follow, that God 
must in many cases truly repent what he has done, so as 
properly to wish he had done otherwise : by treason that 
the event of things, in those affairs which are most import 
tant, viz. the affairs of his moral kingdotn, being uncertain 
and comingent, often happens quite otlierwise than he 
was aware beforehand. And there would be reason to 
understand that in the most literal sense in Gen. vi. G, 
^^ It repented the Lord that he had made man on the 
earth, and it grieved him at his heart." And that 1 Sam. 
XV. 11, contrary to that, Num. xxiii. 19, << God is not 
the son of man, that he should repent." And 1 Sam. xv. 
15, 29, <^ Also the strength of Israel will not lie, nor re- 
pent ; for he is not a tnan, that he should repent." Yea, 
frpm this notion it would follow, that God is liable to re« 
pent and be grieved at his heart, in a literal sense, contin- 
ually ; and is always exposed to an infinite number of 
reaKdisappointments in bis governing the world ; and to 
nunifold, constant, great perplexity and vexation: but 



i66 GOD CBRTAIMLT rOREKNOWfl PART it. 

this is not very consistent with his title of God over attf 
blessed forevermore ; which represents him as possessed 
of perfect, constant, and uninterrupted tranquillity and fe* 
licity, as God over the universe, and in his management 
of the aifitirs of the world as supreme and universal ruler. 
See Rom. i. 25. ix. 5. 2 Cor. xi. 34. 1 Tim. vi. 15. 

Arg. IV. It will also follow, from this notion, that as 
God is liable to be continually repenting what be has 
done, so he must be exposed to be constantly changing 
his mind and intentions as to his future conduct ; al- 
tering his measures, relinquishing his old designs, and 
forming new schemes and projections. For his purposes, 
even as to the main parts of his scheme^ namely, such as 
belong to the state of his moral kingdom, must be always 
liable to be broken, through want of foresight ; and he 
must be continually putting his system to rights, as it gets 
out of order, through the contingence of the actions of 
moral agents : he must be a being, who, instead of being 
absolutely immutable, must necessarily be the subject of 
infinitely the most numerous acts of repentance and chan* 
ges of intention, of any being whatsoever ; for this plain 
reason, that his vastly extensive charge comprehends an 
infinitely greater number of those things which are to him 
contingent and uncertain. In such a situation, he must 
have lit.tle else to do but to mend broken links as well as 
he can, and be rectifying his disjointed frame and disor* 
dered movements in the best manner the case will allow. 
The supreme Lord of all things must needs be under 
great and miserable disadvantages, in governing the world 
which he has made and has the care of, through bis be^ 
Ing utterly unable to find out things of chief importance 
which hereafter shall befall his system, which, if he did 



»CT. XI. THE VOLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. 167 

but know, he might make seasonable provision for. In 
many cases, there may be very great necessity that be 
should make provision, in the maimer of his ordering and 
disposing things, for some great events which are to hap* 
pen, of vast and extensive influence, and endless conse- 
quence to the universe, which he may see afterwards, 
when it is toe late, and may wish in vain that he had 
known beforehand, that he might have ordered his affairs 
accordingly. And it is in the power of man, on these 
principles, by his devices, purposes, and actions, thus to 
disappoint God, break his measures, make him continual- 
ly to change his mind, subject him to vexation, and bring 
him into confusion. 

But how do these things consist with reason, or with 
the word of God ? which represents that all Go(Vs worksf 
all that he has ever to do, the wliole scheme and series of 
his operations, are from the beginning perfectly in his 
view ; and declares that, whatever devices and designs 
are in the hearts of men, ^^ the counsel of the Lord is that 
which shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart to all gen- 
erations," Prov. xix. 21. Psal. xxxiii.'* 10, 11. "And 
that which the Lord of Hosts hath purposed none shall 
dbannul," Isai. xiv. 27. And that he cannot be frustra- 
ted in one design or thought. Job xlii. 2. And " that 
which God doth, it shall be for ever, that nothing can 
be put to it or taken from it," Eccl. iii. 14. The stabil- 
ity and perpetuity of, God's counsels are expressly spoken 
of as connected with the foreknowledge of God, Isafiah 
xlvi. 10, " Declaring the end, from the b§ginriing, and 
from ancient times the things that jare not yet done ; say- 
ing. My counsel shall stand, and 1 will do all my pleas- 
ure." And bow are these things consistent with what 



> 

/ 



l6d GOl> CBKTAINLT fORKKMOWS PhUt It. 

the Scripture says of God^s immutability, which repre- 
sents him as ivitkout variabkness or $hadow of turning ; 
aod S|)eaks of him most |)articularly as unciiangcahle with 
regard to hb purposes, Mai. iii. 6, '* 1 am the Lord ; I 
change not ; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed/' 
Exod. iii. 14, *' 1 am that I am." Job xxiii. 13, 14| 
'^ He is in' one mind; and who can turn him? And 
wliat his soul de$ireth,even that he doth : for he perform- 
etb the thing that is appointed for me." 

Arg. V. If this notion of God's itrnorance of future vo* 
litions of moral agents be tlioroughiy considered in its 
consequences, it will appear to follow from it, that God, 
after he had made the world, was liable to be wholly 
frustrated of his end in the creation of it ; and so has 
been, in liko manner, liable to be frustrated of his end in 
all the great works he hath wrought. It is manifest, the 
moral world is the end of the natural : the rest of the 
creation is but an bouse which God hath built, with fur- 
niture, for moral agents: and the good or bad state of the 
moral world depends on the improvement they make of 
their natural agency, and so depends on their volitions. 
And therefore, if these cannot be foreseen by God, be- 
cause they are contingent, and subject to no kind of ne- 
cessity, then the afiairs of the moral world are liable to go 
wrong, to any assignable degree ; yea, liable to be utterly 
ruined. As, on this scheme, it may well be supposed 
to be literally said, when mankind, by the abuse of their 
moral agency, became very corrupt before the flood, that 
the Lord repented that he had made man on the earth, 
and it grieved him at his heart ; so, when he made the 
universe^ he did not know but that he nught be so disapn 
pointed in it, that it might grieve him at his heart that hf

SECT. XI. THE VOJLITIONS OF MORAL AGENTS. l69 

bad made k. It actually proved, that all mankitid be- 
came sinful, and a very great part of the angels aposta- 
tised : and how could God know beforehand that all of 
them would not? And how could God know but that all 
mankind, notwithstanding means used to reclaim them, 
being still left to the freedom of their own will, would 
continue in their apostasy, and grow worse and worse, as 
they of the old v^orld before the flood did ? 

According to the scheme I am endeavoring to confute, 
neither the fall of men nor angels could be foreseen, and 
God must be greatly disappointed in these events ; and 
so the grand scheme and contrivance for our redemption, 
and destroying the works of the devil, by the Messiah, 
and all the great things God has done in the prosecution 
of these designs, must be only the fruits of his own dis- 
appointment, and contrivances of his to mend and patch 
up, as well as he could, his system, which originally was 
all very good, and perfectly beautiful, but was man'ed, 
broken, and confounded,^ by the free will of angels and 
men. And still he must be liable to be totally disappoint- 
ed a second time. He could not know that he should ( 
have his desired success, in the incarnation, life, death, i 
resurrection, and exaltation, of his only-begotten Son, and • 
other great works accomplished to restore the state of- 
things : he could not know, after all, whether there would : 
actually be any tolerable measure of restoration ; for this ' 
depended on the free will of man. There has been a ^ 
general great apostasy of almost all the Christian world, 
to that which was worse than heathenism, which coniin- 
ued for many ages. And bow could God, without fore- 
seeing men's volitions, know whether ever Christendom 
would return from this apostasy ? And which way could 

15 



170 CERTAIN rORBKNOWLEDOE PART 11. 

he tell beforehand how soon it would begin ? The apos- 
tle says it began to work in his time ; and how could it 
be known how far it would proceed in that age? Yea, 
how could it be known, that the Gospel, which was not 
effectual for the reformation of the Jews, would ever be 
effectual for the turning of the heathen nations from their 
heathen apostasy, which they had been confirmed in for 
so many ages ? 

It is rejpresented often in Scripture, that God, who 
made the world for himself, and created it for his pleas- 
ure, would infallibly obtain his end in the creation, and 
in all his works; that as all things are q/*him, so they 
would all be to him ; and that in the final issue of things, 
it would appear that be is the first and the last. Rev. 
xxi. 6, " And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha 
and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the 
last." But these things are not consistent with God's 
being so liable to be disappointed in all his works, nor in- 
deed with his failing of his end in anything that he has 
undertaken or done. 

SECTION XII. 

god's certain foreknowledge of the future T0LTT10N8 
OF MORAL AGENTS, INCONSISTENT WITH SUCH A CONTIN- 
GENCE OF THOSE VOLITIONS AS IS WITHOUT ALL NECESSITY. 

Hating proved that God has a certain and infallible 
prescience of the act of the will of moral agents, I come 
now, in the second place, to show the consequence ; to 
show how it follows from hence, that these events are 
necessary y with a necessity of connection or consequence. 

The. chief Arminian divines, so far as I have had op- 



j 



SKCt. XII. IKlPEBS SOME KECESSITT. 171 

portuoity to observe, deny this consequence ; and affirm, 
that if such foreknowledge be allowed, it is no evidence 
of any necessity of the event foreknown. Now I desire, 
that this matter may be particularly and thoroughly in- 
quired into. I cannot but think that, on particular and 
full consideration, it may be perfectly determined, wheth- 
er it be indeed so or not. 

In order to a proper consideration of this matter, I 
would qMerve the following things. 

I. It is very evident, with regard to a thing whose ex- 
istence is infallibly and indissolubly connected with some- 
thing which already hath or has had existence, the exis- 
tence of that thing is necessary. Here may be noted : 

1. I observed before, in explaining the nature of ne- 
cessity, that in things which are past, their past existence 
is now necessary : having already made sure of existence, 
it is too late for any possibility of alteiation in that res- 
pect : it is now impossible that it should be otherwise 
than true, that that thing has existed. 

2. If there be any such thing as a divine foreknow- 
ledge of the volitions of free agents, that foreknowledge, 
by the supposition, is a thing which already Aa^, and long 
ago had, existence ; and so, now its existence is neces- 
sary ; it is now utterly impossible to be otherwise than 
that this foreknowledge should be, or should have been. 

3. It is also very manifest, that those things which are 
indissolubly connected with other things that are neces- 
sary, are themselves necessary. As that proposition 
whose truth is necessarily connected with another propo- 
sition, which is necessarily true, is itself necessarily true. 
To say otherwise, would be a contradiction : it would be 
in effect to say, that the connection was indissoluble, and 



I 

I

172 CEKTAIN FOREKNOWLEDGE PART 11. 

1 

yet was not so, but might be broken. IF that, whose 
existence is indissolubly connected with something whose 
existence is now necessary, is itself not necessary, then it 
may possibly iiot exists notwithstanding that indissoluble 
connection of its existence. — ^Whether the absurdity be 
not glaring, let the reader judge. 

4. It is no less erident, that if there be a full, certain, 
and infallible foreknowledge of the future existence of the 
volitions of moral agents, then there is a certain infallible 
and indissoluble connection between those events and 
that foreknowledge ; and that therefore^ by the preceding 
observations, those events are necessary events ; being 
infallibly and tndissolubly connected with that, whose ex- 
istence already is, and so is now necessary, and cannot 
but have been. 

To say the foreknowledge is certain and infallible, and 
yet the connection of the event with that foreknowledge 
is not indissoluble, but dissoluble and fallible, is very ab- 
surd. To affirm it, would be the same thing as to affirm 
that there is no necessary connection between a proposi- 
tion's being infallibly known to be true, and its being true 
indeed. So that it is perfectly demonstrable, that if there 
be any infallible knowledge of future volitions, the event 
is necessary; or, in other words, that it is impossible but 
the event should come to pass. For if it be not impossi- 
ble but that it may be otherwise, then it is not impossible 
but that the proposition which affirms its future coming 
to pass, may not now be true. But how absurd is that, 
on the supposition that there is now an infallible know- 
ledge (i. e. knowledge which it is impossible should fail) 
that it is true. There is this absurdity in it, that it is not 



J 



S£Cf • XII. lNr£AS SOME NECESSITY. 173 

impossible hut that there now should be no truth in that 
proposition which is now infallibly known to be true. 

II. That no future event can be certainly foreknown, 
whose existence is contingent, and without all necessity, 
may be proved thus ; it is impossible for a thing to be 
certainly known to any intellect without evidence. To 
suppose otherwise, implies a contradiction : because, for 
a thing to be certainly known to any understanding, is for 
it to be evident to that understanding : and for a thing to 
be evident to any understanding, is the same thing as for 
that understanding to see evidence of it : but no under- 
standing, created or increated, can see evidence where 
there is none : for that is the same thing as to see that to 
be which is not. And therefore, if there be any truth 
which is absolutely without evidence, that truth is abso* 
lutely unknowable, insomuch that it implies a contradic- 
tion to suppose that it is known. 

But if there he any future event, whose existence is 
contingent, without all necessity, the future existence of' 
the event is absolutely without etidence. If there be 
any evidence of it, it must be one of these two sorts, 
either self-evidence or proof; for there can be no other 
sort of evidence but one of these two : an evident thing 
must be either evident in itself. ox evident tn something 
else ; that is, evident by connection with something else. 
But a future thing, whose existence is without all neces- 
sity, can have neither of these sorts of evidence. It can- 
not b^ self evident ; for if it be, it may be now known, 
by what is now to be seen in the thing itself; either its 
present existence, or the necessity of its nature : but both 
these are contrary to the supposition. It is supposed^ 

16* 



174 CERTAIN rORCKNOWLSDGE FART If* 

both that the thing has no present existence to be seen, 
and also that it is not of such a nature as to be necessarily 
existent for the future : so that its future existence is not 
self-evident. And, secondly, neither is there any proofs 
or evidence in anything ehe^ or evidence of connection 
with something else that is evident : for this is also con- 
trary to the supposition. It is supposed, that there is no^ 
nothing existent, with which the future existence of the 
contingent event is connected. For such a connection 
destroys its contingence, and supposes necessity. Thus 
it is demonstrated, that there is in the nature of things ab- 
solutely no evidence at all of the future existence of that 
event, which is contingent, without all necessity (if any 
such event tliere be), neither self-evidence nor proof. 
And therefore the thing in reality is not evident ; and so 
cannot be seen to be evident, or, which is the same thing, 
cannot be known. 

Let us consider this in an example. Suppose that five 
thousand seven hundred and sixty years ago there was no 
other being but the Divine Being ; and then this world, 
or some particular body or spirit, all at once starts out of 
nothing into being, and takes on itself a particular nature 
and form ; all in absolute contingence, without any con- 
cern of God, or any other cause, in the matter ; without 
any manner of ground or reason of its existence ; or any 
depetidence upon, or connection at all with, anything 
foregoing : I say, that if this be supposed, there was no 
evidence of that event beforehand. There was no evi- 
dence of it to be seen in the thing itself; for the thing 
itself as yet was not. And there was no evidence of it 
to be seen in anything else ; for evidence in something 
eke, is connection with sometbiug else : but such connec- 



SECT. Xtl. INFERS SOME NECESSITY. 175 

tion is contrary to the supposition. There was no evi- 
dence before, that this thing would happen ;' for, by the 
supposition, there was no reason why it should happen^ 
rather than something else, or rather than nothing. And 
if so, then all things before were exactly equal, and the 
same with respect to that and other possible things ; there 
was no preponderation, no superior weight or value ; and 
therefore nothing that could be of any weight or value to 
determine any understanding. The thing was absolutely 
without evidence, and absolutely unknowable^ An in- 
crease of understanding, or of the capacity of discerning, 
Jias no tendency, and makes no advance, to a discerning 
any signs or evidences of it, let it be increased never so 
much ; yea, if it be increased infinitely. The increase of 
the strength of sight may have a tendency to enable to 
discern the evidence which is far off, and very much hid, 
and deeply involved in clouds and darkness ; but it has 
no tendency to enable to discern evidence where there is 
none. If the sight be infinitely strong, and the capacity 
of discerning infinitely great, it will enable to see all that 
there is, and to see it perfectly, and with ease : yet it has 
no tendency at all to enable a being to discern that evi- 
dence which is not ; but, on the contrary, it has a tendency 
to enable to discern with great certainty that there is 
none. 

III. To suppose the future volitions of moral agents not 
to be necessary events ; or, which is the same thing, 
events which it b not impossible but that they may not 
come to pass ; and yet to suppose that God certainly 
foreknows them, and knows all things, is to suppose God's 
knowledge to be inconsistent with itself. For to say, 
that God certainly, and without all conjecture, knows 



176 CERTAIN FOREKNOWLEDGE PART II. 

that a thing will infallibly be, which at the same time he 
knows to be so coniingent that it may possibly not be, 
is to suppose his knowledge inconsistent with itself; or 
that one thing that he knows, is utterly inconsistent with 
another thing that he knows. It is ihe same thing as to 
say, he now knows a proposition to be of certain infalli-^ 
ble truth, which he knows to be of contingent uncertain 
truth. If a future volition is so without all necessity, that 
there is nothing hinders but that it may not be, then the 
proposition which asserts its future existence, is so un- 
certain, that there is nothing^ hinders but that the truth of 
it may entirely fail. And if God knows all things, he 
knows this proposition to be thus uncertain. And that 
is inconsistent with his knowing that it is infallibly true, 
and so inconsistent with his infallibly knowing that it is 
true. If the thing be indeed contingent, God views it so, 
and judges it to be contingent, if he views things as they 
are. If the event be not necessary, then it is possible it 
may never be : and if it be possible it may never be, God 
knows it may possibly never be ; and that is to know that 
the proposition which affirms its existence, may possibly 
not be true ; and that is to know that the truth of it is 
uncertain ; which surely is inconsistent with his know- 
ing it as a certain truth. If volitions are in themselves 
contingent evenjs, without all necessity, then it is no ar- 
gument of perfection of knowledge in any being to de- 
termine peremptorily that they will be ; but, on the con- 
trary, an argument of ignorance and mistake, because it 
would argue, that he supposes that proposition to be cer- 
tain, which in its own nature, and all things considered, is 
uncertain and contingent. To say, in such a case, that 
God may have ways of knowing contingent events which 



sect. 1LU. mttns tout Kec£ssiT^. 177 

we cannot conceive of, is ridiculous ; as much so, as to 
say that God may know contradictions to be truQ, for ought 
we know, or that he may know a thing to be certain, and 
at the same time know it not to be certain, though we 
cannot conceive how ; because he has ways of kno>\ing, 
which we cannot comprehend. 

Corol. 1. From what has been observed, it is evident 
that the absohite decrees of God are no more inconsistent 
with human liberty, on account of any necessity of the 
event which follows ffom such decrees, than the absolute 
foreknowledge of God. Because the connection between 
the event and certain foreknowledge, is as infallible and 
indissoluble as between the event and an absolute decree. 
That is, it is no more impossible, that the event and de- 
cree should not agree together, than that the event and 
absolute knowledge should disagree. The connection be- 
tween the event and foreknowledge is absolutely perfect, 
by the supposition ; because it is supposed, that the cer- 
tainty and infallibility of the knowledge is absolutely per- 
fect. And it being so, the certainty cannot be increased ; 
and therefore the connection between the knowledj^e and 
the thing known, cannot be increased ; so that if a decree 
be added to the foreknowledge, it does not at all increase 
the connection, or make it more infallible and indissoluble. 
If it were not so, the certainty of knowledge might be in- 
creased by the addition of a decree ; which is contrary 
to the supposition, which is, that the knowledge is abso- 
lutely perfect, or perfect to the highest possible degree. 

There is as much of an impossibility but that the things 
which 'are infallibly foreknown, should be or (which is the 
same thing) as great a necessity of their future existence, 
as if the event were already written down, atld was known 



Ilfd FOREKNOWLEDGE iNFfiRS NECESSITY, 1»ART tl. 

and read by all mankind, through all preceding ages, and 
there was the nsost indissoluble and perfect connection 
possible between the writing and the thing written. In 
such a case, it would be as impossible the event should fail 
of existence, as if it had existed already ; and a decree 
cannot make an event surer or more necessary than this. 

And therefore, if there be any such foreknowledge, as 
it has been proved there is, then necessity of connection 
and consequence is not at ail inconsistent with any liberty 
which man or any bther creature enjoys. And from 
hence it may be inferred, that absolute decrees of God, 
which do qot at all increase the necessity, are not at all 
inconsistent with the liberty which man enjoys, on any 
such account, as that they make the event decreed ne- 
cessary and render it utterly impossible but that it should 
come to pass. Therefore, if absolute decrees are incon- ' 
sistent with man's liberty as a moral agent, or his liberty ; 
in a state of probation, or any liberty whatsoever that he ' 
enjoys, it is not on account of any necessity which abso- , 
lute decrees infer. ' 

Dr. Whitby supposes there is a great diOference be- 
tween God's foreknowledge, and his decrees, with regard 
to necessity of future events. In his " Discourse on the 
Five Points," p. 474, etc. he says, " God's prescience 
has no influence at all on our actions. — Should God, (says 
he,) by immediate revelation, give me the knowledge of 
the event of any man's state or actions, would my know- 
ledge of them have any influence upon his actions ? Surely 
none at ail — our knowledge doth not aflfect the things we 
know, to make them more certain, or more future, than 
they would be without it. Now, foreknowledge in God is 
knowledge. As therefore knowledge has no influence on 



SECT. XII. AS MUCH AS A OCCREE. . 179 

things that are, so neither has foreknowledge on things that 
shall be. And, consequently, the foreknowledge of any ac- 
tion that would be otherwise free, cannot alter or diminish 
that freedom. Whereas God's decree of election is power- 
ful and active, and comprehends the preparation Und exhi- 
bition of such means as shall unfrustrably produce the end. 
Hence God's prescience renders no actions neccessary.'* 
And to this purpose, p. 473, he cites Origen, where he says, 
^* God's prescience is not the cause of things future, but 
their being future is the cause of God's prescience that 
they will be :" and Le Blanc, where he says, " This is 
the truest resolution of this difficulty, that prescience is 
not the cause that things are future ; but their being future is 
the cause they are foreseen." In like manner. Dr. Clarke, 
in his " Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of 
God," pp. 95 — 99. And the author of the " Freedom 
of Will in God and the Creature," speaking to the like 
purpose with Dr. Whitby, represents " Foreknowledge 
as having no more influence on things known, to make 
them necessary, than after-knowledge," or to that pur- 
pose. 

To all which I would say, that what is said about 
knowledge, its not having influence on the thing known 
to make it necessary, is nothing to the purpose, nor does 
it in the least affect the foregoing reasoning. Whether 
prescience be the thing that makes the event necessary or 
no, it alters not the case. Infallible foreknowledge may 
prove the necessity of the event foreknown, and yet not 
be the thing which causes the necessity. If the fore- 
knowledge be absolute, this proves the event known to be 
necessary, or proves that it is impossible but that the 
event should be, by some means or other, either by a de- 



180 FOREKNOWLEDGE INFERS NECESSITT, PART. II. 

cree, or some other way, if there be any other way ; be- 
cause, as was said before, it is absurd to say, that a pro- 
position is known to be certainly and infallibly true, which 
yet may possibly prove not true. 

The whole of the seeming force of this evasion lies in 
this ; that, inasmuch as certain foreknowledge does not 
cause an event to be necessary, as a decree does ; there- 
fore it does not prove it to be necessary, as a decree does. 
But there is no force in this arguing : for it is built wholly on 
this supposition, that nothing can prove, or be an evidence 
of a thing's being necessary, but that which has a causal 
influence to make it so. But this can never be maintain- 
ed. If certain foreknowledge of the future existing ofan 
event, be not the thing which first makes it impossible 
that it should fail of existence ;» yet it may, and certainly 
does, demonstrate that it i$ impossible it should fail of it, 
however that impossibility comes. If foreknowledge be 
not the cause, but the effect, of this impossibility, it may 
prove that there is such an impossibility, as much as if it 
were the cause. It is as strong arguing from the effect to 
the cause, as from the cause to ihe effect. It is enough, 
that an existence, which is infallibly foreknown, cannot 
fail, whether that impossibility arises from the foreknow- 
ledge, or is prior to it. It is as evident, as it is possible 
anything should be, that it is impossible a thing which is 
infallibly known to be true, should prove not to be true : 
therefore there is a necesst/y that it should be otherwise; 
whether the knowledge be the cause of this necessity, or 
the necessity the cause of the knowledge. 

All certain knowledge, whether it be foreknowledge or 
after-knowledge, or concomitant knowledge, proves thp 
thing known now to be necessary, by some mefins or 
other; or proves that it is impossible it should now b^ 



8SCT. XII. AS MUCH AS A DECREE. 181 ^ 

Otherwise than true. I freely allow, that foreknowledge 
does not prove a thing to be necessary, any more than 
aider-knowledge J but • then after-knowledge, which is 
certain and infallible, proves that it is now become Impos- 
sible but that the proposition known should be true. Cer- 
tain after-knowJedge proves that it is now, in the time of 
the knowledge, by some means or other, become impos- 
sible but that the. proposition which predicates j7a«^ exis- 
tence on the event, should be true. And so does certain 
foreknowledge prove, that now, in the time of the know- 
ledge, it is, by some means or other, become impossible 
but that the proposition which predicates yU^u re existence 
on the event, should be true. The necessity of the truth of 
the propositions, consisting in the present impossibility of 
the non-existence of the event affirmed, in both cases is 
the immediate ground of the certainty of the knowledge; 
there can be no certainty of knowledge without it. 

There must be a certainty in things themselves, before 
they are certainly known, or (which is the same thing) 
known to be certain. For certainty of knowledge is 
nothing else but knowing or discerning the certainty there 
isin the things themselves, ,which are known. Therefore 
there must be a certainty in things to be a ground of cer- 
tainty of knowledge, and to render things capable of be- 
ing known to be certain. And this is nothing but the 
necessity of the truth known, or its being impossible "but 
that it should be true ; or, in other words, the firm and 
infallible connection between the subject and predicate dt 
the proposition that contains that truth. All certainty of 
knowledge consists in the view of the firmness of that 
connection. So God's certain foreknowledge pf the futi^ 
existence of any eventi is bis view of the firm and indif- 

16 



182 FOREKNOWLEDGE INFERS NECESSITF, PART 11. 

soluble connection of the subject and predicate of the 
proposition that affirms its future existence. The subject 
is that possible event ; the predicate is its future existing : 
\ but if fulule existence be firmly and indissolubly connected 
with that event, then the future existence of that event is 
I necessary. If God certainly knows the future existence 
of an event which is wholly contingent, and may possibly 
never be, then he sees a firm connection between a sub- 
ject and predicate that are not firmly connected ; which 
is a contradiction. 

I* allow what Dr. Whitby says to be true, " That mere 
knowledge does not affect the thing known, to make it more 
certain or more future." But yet, I say, it supposes and 
proves the thing to be already both future and certain ; 
i. e. necessarily future. Knowledge of futurity, suppo- 
ses /u^MnVy; and a certain Arnou^/e^g-e of futurity,. suppo- 
ses certain futurity^ antecedent to that certain knowledge. 
But there is no other cerkin futurity of a thing, antece- 
dent to certainty of knowledge, than a prior impossibility 
but that the thing should prove true ; or (which is the 
same thing) the necessity of the event. 

I would observe one thing further concerning this mat- 
ter ; it is this : tiiat if it be a6 those forementioned writers 
suppose, that God's foreknowledge is not the cause, but 
the effect, of the existence of the event foreknown ; this 
is so far from showing that this foreknowledge doth not 
infer the necessity of the existence of that event, that it 
rather shows the contrary the more plainly. Because it 
shows the existence of the event to be so settled and 
firm, that it is as if it had already been ; inasmuch as in 
effect it actually exists already ; its future existence has 
already had actual influence and efficiency^ and has pro^ 



SECT. XII. AS MUCH AS A BECBES. 183 

duced an effect, viz« prescience : the effect exists already ; 
and as the effect supposes, the cause is connected with 
the cause, and depends entirely upon it, therefore it is as 
if the future event which is the cause, had existed al- 
ready. The effect is firm as possible, it having already 
the possession of existence, and has made sure of it. But 
the effect cannot be more firm and stable than its cause, 
ground, and reason. The (building cannot be firmer than 
the foundation. 

To illustrate this matter, let us suppose the appear- 
ances and images of things in a glass ; for instance, a re- 
flecting telescope, to be the real effects of heavenly bodies 
(at a distance, and out of sight) which they resemble : 
if it be so, then, as these images in the telescope have bad 
a past actual existence, and it is become utterly impossi- 
ble now that it should be otherwise than that they have 
existed ; so they, being the true effects of the heavenly 
bodies they resemble, this proves the existing of those 
heavenly bodies to be as real, infallible, firm, and neces- 
sary, as the existing of these effects ; the one being con- 
nected with, and wholly depending on, the other. — Now 
let us suppose future existences some way or other to 
have influence back, to produce effects beforehand^ and 
cause exact and perfect images of themselves in a glass, 
a thousand years before they exist, yea, in all preceding 
ages ; but yet that these images are real effects of these 
future existences, perfectly dependent on, and connected 
with, their cause ; these effects and images having already 
had actual existence, rendering that matter of their exist- 
ing perfectly firm and stable, and utterly impossible to be 
otherwise : this proves in like manner, as in the other in- 
stance, that the existence of the things, which are their 



184 CERTADT FOREKirOWLKDGE PART II. 

Causes, is also equally sure, firm, and necessary ; aud that 
if is alike impossible but that they shouM be, as if they 
bad been already, as their effects have. And if, instead 
of images in a glass, we suppose the antecedent effects to 
be perfect ideds of them in the Divine Mind, which have 
existed there from all eternity, which are as properly ef- 
fects, as truly and properly connected with their cause, 
the'^case is not altered. 

Another thing which has been said by sonfte Arminians, 
to take off the force of what is urged from God's pre- 
science, against the contingence of the volitions of moral 
agents, is to this purpose :— -" That when we talk of fore- 
knowledge in God, there is no strict propriety in our so 
faking ; and that although it be true, that there is in 
God the most perfect knowledge of all events, from eter- 
Bffty to eternity, yet there is no such thing as before and af- 
Urxn God, but he sees all things by one perfect, unchange- 
able view, without any succession." To this I answer: 

1. It has been already shown, that all certain know- 
kdge proves the necessity of the truth known ; whether 
it be before^ ofter^ or at the same time. Though it be 
true, that there is no succession in God's knowledge, and 
the manner of his knowledge is to us inconceivable, yet 
thus much we know concerning it, that there is no events' 
past, present, or to come, that God is ever uncertain of; 
he never is, never was, and never will be, without infalli- 
ble knowledge of it ; he always sees the existence of it 
to be certain and infallible. And as he always sees things 
just as they are in truth, hence there never is in reality 
anything contingent in such a sense, as that possibly it 
may hajlpeh never to exist. If, strictly speaking, there 
is no foreknowledge in God, it is because those things 



«ECT. XII. INTERS SOKE NECESSITY^ 186 

Ni^hicb are future to us, are as present to God as if they 
already bad existence ; and that b as much as to say, that 
future events are always in God's view as evident, clear, 
sure, and necessary, as if they already were. If there 
never is a time wherein, the existence of the event is not 
present with God, then there never is a time wherein it 
is not as much impossible for it to fail of existence, as if 
its existence were present, and were already come lo 
pass. 

God's viewing things so perfectly and unchangeably as 
that there is no succession in his ideas or judgment, does 
not hinder but that there is properly now, in the mind of 
God, a certain and perfect knowledge of moral actions of 
men, which to us are an hundred years hence : yea, the 
objection supposes this ; and therefore it certainly does not 
hinder* but that, by the foregoing arguments, it is now im* 
possible these moral actions should not come to pass. 

We know that God knows the future voluntary actions 
of men in such a sense beforehand, as that he is able par- 
ticularly to declare, and foretell them, and write them, or 
cause them to be written down in a book, as he often has 
done; and that therefore the necessary connection which 
there is between God's knowledge and the event known, 
does as much prove the event to be necessary beforehand, 
as if the Divine knowledge were in the same sense before 
the event, as the prediction or writing is. If the know- 
ledge be infallible, then the expression of it in the written 
prediction is infallible ; that is, there is an infallible con- 
nection between that written prediction and the event. 
And if so, then it is fm possible it should ever be other- 
wise, than that that prediction and the event should agree ; 
and this is the same thing as to say, it is impossible but 

16« 



186 CBHTAIN rORBKMOWLE06C PART II* 

that the eveDt should come to pass ; and this is the saine 
as to say, that its coming to pass is necessary. So that it 
is manifest, that there being no proper succession in God's 
mind, makes no alteration as to the necessity of the existr 
ence of the events which God knows. Yea, 

Q. This is so far from weakening the proof which has 
been given of the impossibility of the not coming to p^ss 
of future events known, as that it establishes that where- 
in the strength of the foregoing arguments consists, and 
shows the clearness of the evidence. For, 

(1.) Tlie very reason why God's knowledge is without 
succession, is, because it is absolutely perfect, to the high- 
est possible degree of clearness and certainty : all things, 
whether past, present, or to come, being viewed with 
equal evidence and fulness,; future things being seen with 
as much clearness as if they were present ; the view is 
always in absolute perfection ; and absolute constant per* 
fection admits of no alteration, and so no succession ; the 
actual existence of the thing known, does not at all in- 
crease or add to the clearness or certainty of the .thing 
known : God calls the things that are not as though they 
were ; they are all one to him as if they had already ex- 
isted. But. herein consists the strengtli of the demon- 



stration before given, of the impossibility of the not exist- 
ing of those things, whose existence God knows ; that it 
is as impossible they should fail of existence, as if they 
existed already. This objection, instead of weakening 
this argument, sets it in the clearest and strongest light ; 
for it supposes it to be so indeed, that the existence of fu- 
ture events is in God's view so much as if it already had 
been, that when they coiBe actually to exist, it makes not 
the least alteration or variation in his view or knowledge 
of them. 



SCCT. XII. INFKES SOME NECESSITY. 187 

(2.) The pbjectioD is founded on the immutability of 
Grod's knowledge : for it is the immutability of knowledge 
that makes his knowledge to be without successioOi But 
chui most directly and plainly demonstrates the thing I in- 
sist on, viz. that it is utterly impossible the known events 
should fail of existence. For if that were possible, then . 
it would be possible for there to be a change in God's 
knowledge and view of things. For if the known event 
should fall of existence, and not come into being, as God 
expected, then God would see it, and so would change 
bis mind, and see his former mistake ; and thus there 
would be change and succession in his knowledge. 
But as God is immutable, and so it is utterly infinite- 
ly impossible that his view should be changed ; so it is, 
for the same reason, just so impossible that the foreknown - 
event should not exist : and that is to be impossible in 
the highest degree : and therefore the contrary is neces- 
sary. Nothing is more impossible than that the immuta- 
ble God should be changed by the succession of time ; 
who comprehends all things, from eternity to eternity, in 
ope most perfect and unalterable view ; so that his whole 
eternal duration is vita interminahilis^ tota^ simuly etper* 
fecta possession 

On the whole I need not fear to say, that there is no 
geometrical theorem or proposition whatsoever more ca- 
pable of strict demonstration, than that God's certain pre- 
science of the volitions of moral agents is inconsistent with 
such a contingence of these events, as is without all ne- 
cessity ; and so is inconsistent with the Arminian notion 
of liberty. 

Corol. 2. Hence the doctrine of the Calvinists, con- 
cerning the absolute decrees of God, does not at all infer 



188 CEBTAIir FOREKNOWLEDGE, ETC. PART II. 

any more fatality in things, than will demonstrably fol- 
low from the doctrine of most Arminian divines, who ac- 
knowledge God's omniscience and universal prescience. 
Therefore all objections they make against the doctrine 
of the Calvinists, as implying Hobbs*s doctrine of neces* 
sity, or the stoical doctrine of fate^ lie no more against 
the doctrine of Calvinists than their own doctrine : and 
therefore it doth not become those divines to raise such 
an outcry against the Calvinists on this account. 

Corol. 3. Hence all arguing, from necessity, against the 
doctrine of the inability of unregenerate men to perform 
the conditions of salvation, and the commands of God re- 
quiring spiritual duties, and against the Calvinistic doctrine 
of efficacious grace ; I say, all arguings of Arminians (such 
of them as own God's omniscience) against these things, 
on this ground, that these doctrines, though they do not 
suppose men to be under any constraint or coaction, yet 
suppose them under necessity with respect to their moral 
actions, and those things which are required of them in 
order to their acceptance with God ; and their arguing 
against the necessity of men's volitions, taken from the 
reasonableness of God's commands, promises, and threat- 
enings, and the sincerity of his counsels and invitations ; 
and all objections against any doctrines of the Calvinists^ 
as being Inconsistent with human liberty, because they in- 
fer necessity ; I say, all these arguments and ohjections 
must fall to the ground, and be justly esteemed vain and 
frivolous, as coming Trom them ; being maintained in an 
inconsistence with themselves, and in like manner levelled 
against their own doctrine, as against the doctrine of the 
Calvinists.

Every act of the will has a cause, or it has not. If it 
has a cause, then, according to what has already been de- 
monstrated, it is not contingent, but necessary ; the effect 
being necessarily dependent and consequent on its cause ; 
and that, let the cause be what it will. If the cause is the 
will itself, by antecedent acts choosing and determining, 
still the determined and caused act must be a necessary 
effect. The act, that is the determined effect of the fore- 
going act which is its cause, cannot prevent the efficiency 
of its cause, but must be wholly subject to its determina- 
tion and command, as much as the motions of the hands 
and feet. The consequent commanded acts of the will 
are as passive and as necessary, with respect to the ante- 
cedent determining acts, as the parts of the body are to 
the volitions which determine and command them. And 
therefore, if all the free acts of the will are thus, if they 
are a{l determined effects, determined by the will itself, 
that is, determined by antecedent choice, then they are all 
necessary ; they are all subject to, and decisively fixed by 
the foregoing act, which is their cause : yea, even the de- 
termining act itself; for that must be determined and fixed 
by another act, preceding that, if it be a free and volun^ 
tary s^ct ; and so must be necessary. So that by this all 
tbe free acts of the will are necessary, and cannot be free 
unless they are necessary : because they cannot be free, 



IdO BOTH NECdSSITT AMD CONTINOCNC£ PART II.^ 

according to tlie Arminian notion of freedom), unless tfaey 
are determined by the will, which is to be determined by 
antecedent choice ; which being their cause, proves them 
necessary. And yet they say, necessity is utterly incoQ« 
sistent with liberty. So that, by their scheme, the acts 
of the will cannot be free, unless they are necessary, and 
yet cannot be free if they be not necessary 1 * 

Biit if the other part of the dilemma be taken, and it 
be affirmed that the free acts of the will have no cause 
and are connected with nothing whatsoever that goes be- 
fore them and determines them, in order to maintain their 
proper and absolute contingence, and this should be allow- 
ed to be possible ; still it will not serve their turn. For if 
the volition come to pass by perfect contingence, and with- 
out any cause at all, then it is certain, no act of the will, 
DO prior act of the soul, was the cause; no determination 
or choice of the soul had any hand in it. The will, or 
the soul, was indeed the subject of what happened to it 
accidentally, but was not the cause. The will is not ac- 
tive in causing or determining, but purely the passive sub- 
ject ; at least, according to their notion of action and pas- 
sion. In this case, contingence does as much prevent the 
determination of the will, as a proper cause ; and as to the 
will, it was necessary, and could be no otherwise. For 
to suppose that it could have been otherwise, if the will 
or soul had pleased, is to suppose that the act is depen- 
dent on some prior act of choice or pleasure ; contrary to 
what now is supposed; it is to suppose that it might have 
been otherwise, if its cause had made it or ordered it 
otherwise. But this does pot agree to its having no cause 
or orderer at all. That must be necessary as to the soul, 
which is dependent on no free act of |he soul ; but that 



8BCT. XIII. INCONSISTENT WITH ARMIN. LIBERTT. 191 

whicli is without a cause, is dependent on jio free act of 
the soul ; because, bj the supposition, it is dependent on 
nothing, and is connected with nothing. In such a case, 
the soul is necessarily subjected to what accident brings to 
pass, from time to time, as much as the earth, that is in- 
active, is necessarily subjected to what falls upon it. But 
this does not consist with the Arminian notion of liberty, 
which is the will's power of determining itself in its own 
acts, and being wholly active in it, without passiveness, 
and without being subject to necessity. Thus, contingence 
belongs to the Arminian notion of liberty, and yet is in- 
consistent with it. 

I would here observe, that the author of the " Essay 
on the Freedom of Will in God and the Creature," pages 
76, 77, says as follows : " The word chance always means 
something done without design. Chance and desigu stand 
in direct opposition to each other ; and chance can never 
be properly applied to acts of the will, which is the spring 
of all design, and which designs to choose whatsoever it 
doth choose, whether there be any superior fitness in the 
thing which it chooses, or no ; and it designs to determine 
itself to one thing, where two things, perfectly equal, are 
proposed, merely because it will." But herein appears a 
very great inadvertence in this author. For if Mc will be 
the spring of all design, as he soys, then certainly it is 
not always the effect of design ; and the acts of the will 
themselves must sometimes come to pass, when they do 
not spring from design ; and consequently come to pass 
by chance, according to his own definition of chance. 
And if the will designs to choose whatsoever it does 
choose, and designs to determine itself as he says, then 
it designs to determine all its designs : v hich carries us 



199 ' BOTH NEOfiSSITT AND CONTINOENCE TART II. 

back from one design to a foregoing design determining 
that, and to another deternnining that ; and so on in in- 
finitum. The very first design must be the effect of fore- 
going design, or else it must be. by chance, in his notion 

of it. 

Here another alternative may be (>roposed, ^elating to 
the connection of the acts of the will with something fore- 
going, that is their cause^ not much unlike to the other ; 
which is this : either human liberty is such, that it may 
well stand with volitions being necessarily connected with 
the views of the understanding, and so is consistent with 
necessity ; or it is consistent with, and contrary to, such a 
connection and necessity. The. former is directly sub- 
versive of the Arrainian notion of liberty, consisting in 
freedom from all necessity. And if the latter be chosen 
and it be said that liberty is inconsistent with any such ne- 
cessary connection of volition with foregoing views of the 
understanding, it consisting in freedom from any such ne- 
cessity of the will as that would imply ; then the liberty 
of the soul consists (in part at least) in the freedom 
from restraint, limitation, and government, in its actings 
by the understanding, and in liberty and liableness to act 
contrary to the understanding's views and dictates ; and 
consequently, the more the soul has of this disengagedness 
in its acting, the more liberty. Now let it be considered 
what this brings the noble principle of human liberty to, 
particularly when it is possessed and enjoyed in its perfec- 
tion, viz. a full and perfect freedom and liableness to act 
altogether at random, without the least connection with, 
or restraint or government by, any dictate of reason, or 
anything whatsoever apprehended, considered, or viewed 
by the understanding ; as being inconsistent with the full 



* 

SECT. XIII. INCONSISTENT WITH ABMIN, LIBEBTT. 193 

aod perfect sovereignty of the will over its own determi- 
nations. The notion mankind have conceived of liberty, 
is some dignity, or privilege, something worth claiming. 
But what dignity or privilege is there, in being given up 
to such a wild contingence as this, to be perfectly and 
constantly liable to act unintelligently and unreasonably, 
and as much without the guidance of understanding, as if 
we had none, or were as destitute of perception as the 
smoke that is driven by the wind !

WHEREIN IS IN^UIRED^ WHETHER ANT SUCH LIBERTY OF 
WILL AS ARMINIANS BOLD, BE NECESSARY TO MORAL 
AGENCY, VIRTUE AND VICE, PRAISE AND DISPRAISE^ ETC. 

SECTION I. 

GOD^S MORAL EXCELLENCY NECESSARV, YET VIRTUOUS AND 

PRAISEWORTHY. 

Having considered the Jirst thing that was proposed 
to be inquired into, relating to that freedom of will which 
Arminians maintain ; namely whether any such thing does, 
ever did, or ever can exist, or be conceived of; I come 
now to the second thing proposed to be the subject of 
inquiry ,^viz; Whether any such kind of liberty be re- 
quisite to moral agency, virtue and vice, praise and blame, 
reward and punishment, etc. 

I shall begin with some consideration of the virtue and 
agency of the supreme moral Agent, and Fountain of all 
agency and virtue. 

Dr. Whitby, in his discourse on the " Five Points," 
p. 14, says, " If all human actions are necessary, virtue 
and vice must be empty names ; we being capable of 
nothing that is blame-worlhy, or deserveth praise ; for who 
can blame a person for doing only what he could not help, 
or judge tliat he deserveth praise only for what he could 
not avoid ?" To the like purpose he speaks in places in- 
numerable ; especially in his discourse on the " Freedom of 
the Will ;" constantly maintaining, that a freedom not 
only from coaciion, but necessity^ is absolutely requi- 



SECT, J. ' GO£>'s MOBAL EXCSU.SNCT NUCSSSABY* 195 

site, in order to actions being either worthy of blame, or 
deserving of praise. And to this agrees, as is well known, 
the current doctrine of Arminian writers, who, in general, 
hold, that there is no virtue or vice, reward or puniab- 
ment, nothing to be conunended or blamed, without this 
freedom. And yet Dr. Whitby, p. 300, aHows, that God 
is without this freedom ; and Arminians, so far as I have 
had opportunity to observe, generally acknowledge thai 
God is necessarily holy, and his will necessarily deter- 
mined to that which is good. 

So that, putting these things togetlier, the infinitely holy • 
God, who always used to be esteemed by God's people 
not only virtuous, but a Being in whom is all possible 
virtue, and every virtue in the most absolute purity and 
perfection, and in infinitely greater brightness and amia- 
bleness than in any creature ; the most perfect pattecn of 
vii'tue, and the fountain from whom all others' virtue is 
but as beams from the sun ; and who has been supposed 
to be, on the account of his virtue and holiness, infinitely 
more worthy to be esteemed, loved, honored, admired, 
commended, extolled, and praised, than any creature : and 
he who is thus everywhere represented in Scripture;! 
say, this Being, according to this notion of Dr. Whitby, 
and other Arminians, has no virtue at all: virtue, when 
ascribed to him, is but an empty name ; and he is deserv- 
ing of no commendation or praise ; because he is under 
necessity, he cannot avoid being holy and good as he is ; 
therefore no thanks to him for it. It seems, the holiness, 
justice, faithfulness, etc. of the Most High, must not be 
accounted to be of the nature of that w hich is virtuous 

* 

and f>rai$eworthy. They will not deny, that these things 
in God are good ; but then we must understand theiQ, 



196 god's moral CXC ELLEN CT NECBSSAHT^ PAUT Iff. 

that they are no more virtuous, or of the nature of anjr 
thing cominenclable, than the good that is in any other 
being that is not a moral agent ; as the brightness of thc^ 
sun, and the fertility of the earth, are good, but not vir- 
tuous, because these properties are necessary to these 
bodies, and not the fruit of self-determining power. 

There needs no other confutation of this notion of God's 
not being virtuous or praise-worthy, to Christians acquain- 
ted with the BiUe, but only stating and particularly rep- 
resenting of it. To bring texts of Scripture, wherein 
God is represented as in every respect in the highest man- 
ner virtuous and supremely praise-worthy, would be end- 
less, and is altogether needless to such as have been 
brought up in the light of the Gospel. 

It were to be wished that Dr. Whitby, and other divines 
of the same sort, had explained themselves, when they 
have asserted, that thai which is necessary^ is not deserv- 
ing of praise ; at the same time that they have owned 
God's perfection to be necessary, and so in effect repre- 
senting God as not deserving praise. Certainly, if their 
words have any meaning at air, by praise they must mean 
the exercise or testimony of some sorts of esteem, respect, 
or honorable regard. And will they then say, Uiat men 
are worthy of that esteem, respect, and honor, for their 
virtue, small and imperfect as it is, which yet God is not 
worthy of, for his infinite righteousness, holiness, and good- 
ness ? If so, it must be because of some sort of peculiar 
excellency in the virtuous man, which is his prerogative, 
wherein he really has the preference ; some dignity that 
is entirely distinguished from any excellency, amiableness, 
or honorableness in God ; not in imperfection and depen- 
dence, but in pre-eminence; which, therefore, he does 



SECT. I. TET VIRTUOUS AND PRAISEWORTHY. 197 

not receive from God, nor is God the fountain or pattern 
of it ; nor can God, in that respect, stand in competition 
with biin, as the object of honor and regard ; but roan may 
claim a peculiar esteem, commendation, and glory, that 
God can have no pretension to. Yea, God has no right, 
by virtue of his necessary holiness, to intermeddle with 
that grateful respect and praise due to the virtuous roan, 
who chooses virtue in the exercise of a freedom ad utrum* 
qucy any more than a precious stone, which cannot a^void 
being hard and beautiful. 

And if it be so, let it be explained what that peculiar 
respect is that is due to the virtuous roan, which differs 
in nature and kind, in soroe way of pre*eminence, from 
all that is due to God. What is the name or description 
of that peculiar affection ? Is it esteem, love, admiration, 
honor, praise, or gratitude ? The Scripture everywhere 
represents God as the highest object of all these : there 
we read ofthe«otir« magnifying the Lord ^ of loving him 
with all the hearty with all the souly with all the mind, 
and with all the strength ; admiring him, and his right- 
eous acts, or greatly regarding them as marvellous and 
wonderful; honoring, glorifying, exalting, extolling, 
blessing, thanking, and praising him ; giving unto him 
all the glory of the good which is done or received, rather 
than unto men ; that no flesh should glory in his presence ; 
but that he should be regarded as the Being to whom a)! 
• glory is due. What, then, is that respect ? What pas- 
sion, affection, or exercise, is it, that Arminians call praise, 
diverse from all these things which men are worthy of for 
their virtue, and which God is not worthy of in any degree ? 

If that necessity which attends God's moral perfections 
and actions be as inconsistent with a being worthy of praise, 

n* 



196 CONCCRVriRG god's TIBttTC. PART 111; 

as a necessity of coaetion, as is* plainly implied in, or in- 
ferred from Dr. Whitby's discourse ; then why should we 
thank God for bis goodness^ any more than if be were 
forced to be good, or any more than we should thank one 
of our fetlow-creatures who did us good, not freely, and 
of good win, or from any kindness of heart, but from 
mere compulsion or extrinsical necessity ? Arminians sup- 
pose that God is necessarily a good and gracious being : 
fer this they make the ground of some of their main argu* 
ments against many doctrines maintained by Calvinists ; 
they say these are certainly false, and it is impossible they 
should be true, because they are not consistent with the 
goodness of God. Tl)is supposes, that it is impossible 
but that God should be good : for if it be possible that he 
should be otherwise, then that impossibility of the truth 
of these doctrines ceases, according to their own argu- 
ment. 

Tliat virtue in God is not, in the most proper sense 
retoardable, is not for want of merit in his moral perfec- 
tions and actions, sufficient to deserve rewards from his 
creatures ; but because he is infinitely above all capacity 
of receiving any reward or benefit from the creature : he 
is already infinitely and unchangeably happy, and we can- 
not be profitable unto him. But still he is worthy of our 
supreme benevolence for his virtue ; and would be wor- 
thy of our beneficence, which is the fruit and expression of 
benevolence, if our goodness could extend to him. If 
God deserves to be thanked and praised for bis goodness, 
he would, for the same reason, deserve that we should 
also requite his kindness, if that were possible. What 
shall I render to ihe Lord for all his benefits f is the nat- 
ural language of thankfulness : and so far as in us lies, it 



SECT. II. ACTS or THE WILL OF CHRIST, ETC. 199 

is our duty to recompense God's goodness, and render 
again according to benefits received. And that we might 
have opportunity for so natural an expression of our grati- 
tude to God as beneScence, notwithstanding bis being in- 
finitely above our reach ; he has appointed others to be 
bis receivers, and to stand in bis stead as the objects of 
\^ «Mir beneficence ; socb are especially oui indigent brethren. 

SECTION n. 

THE ACTS OF THE WILL OF THE HUMAN SOUL OF JESUS CHRIST 
NECESSARILY HOLT, TET TRULY VIRTUOUS, PRAISEWORTUY9 
Xf REWARDABLE, ETC. 

I HAVE already considered how Dr. Whitby insists 
upon it, that a freedom, not only from coaction, but ne- 
cessity, is requisite either to virtue or vice^ praise or dis- 
praise^ reward or punishment. He also insists on the 
same freedom as absolutely requisite to a person's being 
the subject of a laWy of precepts y or prohibitions ; in the 
book before mentioned, (pp. 301, 314, 328, 339, 340, 
341, 342, 347, 361, 373, 410.) And of promises and 
threntenings, (pp. 298, 301, 305, 31 1, 339, 340, 363.) 
And as requisite to a state of trials (p. 297, etc.) 

Now, therefore, with an eye to these things, I would 
inquire into the moral conduct and practices of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, which he exhibited in his human nature 
here in his state of humiliation. And firsts I would show, 
that his holy behavior was necessary ; or that it was im- 
possible it should be otherwise than that be should behave 
Inmself holily, and that he should be perfectly holy in 
each individual act of his life. And secondly, that his 
holy behavior was properly the nature of virtue^ and was 



900 ACTS or THE WILL or CHRIST PART III. 

worthy of praise ; and that he was the subject odaw, pre-^ 
ctptiy or commands^ promises j and rewards ; and that be 
was in a state of trial. 

1. It was impossible that tbe acts of tbe will of the hu- 
man soul of Christ should, in any instance, degree, or cir* 
cumstance, be otherwise than holy, and agreeable to God's 
nature and will. The following things nnake thb evident. 

1. God had promised so effectually to preserve and 
uphold him by his Spirit, under .all his temptations, that 
be could not fail of reaching the end /or which he came 
into the world ; which he would have failed of, bad he 
fallen into sin. We have such a promise, Isai. xlii. 1, 2, 
3, 4. '^ Behold my servant, whom I uphold ; mine elect, 
in whom my soul delighteth : I have put my Spirit upon 
him ; he shall bring forth. judgment to the Gentiles. He 
shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard 
in the street. — He shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 
He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judg- 
ment in the earth ; and the isles shall wait for his law.^ 
This promise, of Christ's having God's Spirit put upon 
him, and his not crying and lifting up his voice, etc. re- 
lates to the time of Christ's appearance on earth ; as is 
manifest from the nature of the promise, and also the ap- 
plication of it in the New Testament, Matt. xif. 18. And 
the words imply a promise of liis being so upheld by God's 
Spirit, that he should be preserved from sin ; particularly 
from pride and vain glory, and from being overcome by 
any of the temptations he should be under to affect the 
glory of this world, the pomp of an earthly prince, or the 
applause and praise of men : and that he should be so up- 
held, that he should by no means fail of obtaining the end 
of his coming into the world, of bringing forth judgment 



8VCT. tt. KCCttSSARtLY fidLt. fiOl 

unto victory, and establishing bis kingdom of grace in tbe 
earth. — And in the following verses this promise is con- 
firmed, with the greatest imaginable solemnity : " Thus 
saith the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretch- 
ed them out ; he that spread forth the earth, and that 
which Cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the 
people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein : I 
the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold 
thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a cove- 
nant of tbe people, for a light of the Gentiles ; to open 
the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, 
and them tliat sit in darkness out oT the prison house. I 
am JEH0VA.H, that is my name," etc. 

Very parallel with these promises is that, Isai. xlix. 7, 
8, 9, which also has an apparent respect to the time of 
Christ's humiliation on earth : ^'Thus saith tbe Lord, the 
Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man 
despiseih, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant 
of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall wor- 
ship, because of the Lord that is faithful, and the Holy 
One of Israel, and he shall choose thee. Thus saith the 
Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a 
day of salvation have I helped thee ; and I will preserve 
thee, and give thee for a covenant of the (People, to estab- 
lish the earth," etc. 

^ And in Isai. 1. 5, 6, we have the Messiah expressing 
his assurance, that God would help him, by so opening 
bis ear. or inclining his heart to God's commandments, 
that he should not be rebellious, but should persevere, 
and not apostatise, or turn his back: that through God's 
help, he should be immovable, in a way of obedience, 
under the great trials of reproach and suflfering he should 



908 ACTS or THE WILL OF CHRIST FART I|t. 

meet with ; setting his face like a fliDt : so ihat be kaew, 
W should not be ashamed, or frustrated in his design ; 
and finally should be approved and justified, as having 
done his work faithfully : ^^ The Lord hath opened mine 
ear ; so that I was not rebellious, neither turned away my 
back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to 
diem that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from 
shame and spitting. For tlie Lord God will help me ; 
therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set 
my face as a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. 
He is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? 
let us stand together. Who is mine adversary ? let him 
come near to me. Behold, the Lord God will help me ; 
who is he that shall condemn rae ? lo, they all shall wax 
old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up." 

2. The same thing is evident from all the pron3ises 
which God made to the Messiah, of his future glory, King- 
dom and success, in his office and character of a Mediator : 
which glory could not have been obtained if his holiness 
had failed, and he had been guilty of sin. God's absohrte 
promise of any thing makes the things promised necessary, 
and their failing to take place absolutely impossible : and, 
in like nianner, it makes tJwse things necessary on which 
the thing promised depends, and without which it cannot 
take effect. Therefore it appears, that it was utterly im- 
possible that Ciu'ist's holiness should fail, from such abso- 
lute promises as those, Psal. ex. 4, ^* The Lord hath 
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after 
the order of Melchizedek." And from every other prom- 
ise in that psalm, cont<)ined in each verse of it. And Psal. 
ii. 7, 8, " 1 will declare the decree: the Lord hath said 
QDto me, Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten^ 



BSCT. n. NSCESSAtllLT HOLY. $M3 

thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen (cnr 
thine inheritance," etc. Psal. xlir. 3, 4, etc. " Gird thy 
sword on thy thigh, O most Mighty, with thy glory and 
thy majesty : and in thy majesty ride prosperously." And 
so everything that is said from thence to the end of the 
psalm. And those promises, Isai. iii. 13, 14, 15; and 
liii. 10, 11,12. And all those promises which God makes 
to the Messiah, of success, dominion, and glory, in the 
character of a Redeemer, in Isai. chap. xlix. 

3. It was often promised to the church of God of old, 
for their comfort, that God would give them a righteous, 
sinless Saviour. Jer. xxiii. 5, 6 : '* Behold the days come, 
saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous 
Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall 
execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days 
shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell, safely : and 
this is the name whereby he shall be called, The Lord 
our Righteousness." So, Jer. xxxiii. 15 '<! will cause 
the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and 
he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land." 
Isai. ix. 6, 7 : " For unto us a child is born ; — upon the 
throne of David and of his kingdom, to ordfT it, and to 
establish it with judgment and justice, from henceforth 
even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will do 
this." Chap. xi. at the beginning : " There shall come 
forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall 
grow out of his roots : and the Spirit of the Lord shall 
rest upon him, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of 
the Lord. With righteousness shall he judge the poor, 
and reprove with equity. Righteousness shall be the gir- 
dle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins." 
Chap* Iii. 13 : " My servant shall deal prudently." Chap.

liii. 9 : " Because he bad done no violence, neither was 
guile found in bis mouth." If it be impossible that these 
promises should fail, and it be easier for heaven and earth 
to pass away, than for one jot or tittle of these promises 
of God to pass away, then it was impossible that God 
should commit any sin. Christ himself signified, that it 
was impossible but that the things which were spoken 
concerning him should be fulfilled. Luke xxiv. 44: 
" That all things must be fulfilled, which were written in 
the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, 
concerning me." Matt. xxvi. 53, 54 : ** But bow then 
'shall the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it must be ?" 
Mark, xiv. 49 : '* But the Scriptures must be fulfilled." 
And so the Apostle, Acts. i. 16, 17 : ^' This Scripture 
must needs have been fulfilled." 

4. All the promises, which were made to the church 
of old, of the Messiah as a future Saviour, from that made 
to our first parents in Paradise, to that which was deliver* 
ed by the prophet Malachi, show it to be impossible that 
Christ should not have persevered in perfect holiness. The 
ancient predictions given to God's church, of the Messiah 
as a Saviour, were of the nature of promises, as is evident 
by the predictions themselves, and the manner of deliver-^ 
ing them. But they are expressly, and very often, called 
promises in the New Testament ; as in Luke i. 54, 55, 
72, 78. Acts xiii. 32,33. Rom. i. 1,2,3, and chap. 
XV. 8. Heb. vi. 13, etc. These promises were often 
made with great solemnity, and confirmed with an oath ; 
as in Gen. xxii. 16, 17 : " By myself have I sworn, saith 
the Lord, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in jiiulti- 
plying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and 
98 the sand whiqh is upon the sea«sbore : and in thy seed 



SECT. II. NBCESSABILT HOLT. 205 

shall ail the nations of the earth be bressed." Comp. Ijuke 
i. 72, 73 ; and Gal. iii. 8, 15, 16. The Apostle, in Heb. 
vi. 17, 18, speaking of this promise to Abraham, says : 
'^ Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the 
heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirm- 
ed It by an oath ; that by two immutable things, in which 
it was iMFOSsiBLE for God to lie, he might have strong 
consolation." In which words, the necessity of the ac- 
ooraplishment, or (which is the same thing) tlie imposn- 
biUty of the contrary, is fully declared. So God confirm- 
ed the promise of the great salvation of the Messiah, made 
to David, by an oath ; Psal. Ixxxix. 3,4 : '^ I have made 
a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David 
my servant ; Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build 
up thy throne to all generations." There is nothing that 
is so abundantly set forth in Scripture as sure and irrefra- 
gable, as this promise and oath to David. See Psal. 
Uxxix. 34, 35, 36. 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. Isai. Iv. 4. Acts 
ii. 29, 30, and xiii. 34. The Scripture expressly speaks 
of it as utterly impossible that this promise and oath to 
J)avtd, concerning the everlasting dominion of the Messiah 
of his seed, should fail. Jer. xxxiii. 15, etc. : '* In those 
days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of righteous- 
ness to grow up unto David. For thus saith the Lord, 
David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of 
the house of Israel." Ver. 20, 21 ; " If you can break 
my covenant of the day, and my .covenant of the night, 
arifl that there should not be day and night in their sea- 
son ; then may also my covenant be broken with David 
my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon 
bis throne." So in ver. 25, 26. Thus abundant is th« 
Scripture in representing bow impossible it was, that lb«

206 ACTS or THE WILL OF CHBIST FABf IH. 

promises made of old concerning the great salvation and 
kingdom of the Messiah should fail ; which implies, that 
it was impossible that this Messiah, the second Adam, the 
promised seed of Abraham and of David, should fall from 
his integrity, as the first Adam did. 

5. All the promises that wer6 made to the church of 
God under the Old Testament, of the great enlargement 
of the church, and advancement of her glory, in the days 
of the Gospel, after the coming of the Messiah ; the increase 
of her light, liberty, holiness, joy, triumph over her ene- 
mies, etc., of which so great a part of the Old Testament 
consists ; which are repeated so often, arc so varioudy 
exhibited, so frequently introduced with great pomp and 
solemnity, and are so abundantly sealed with typical and 
symbolical representation ; I say, all these promises imply, 
that the Messiah should perfect the work of redemption ; 
and this implies that he. should persevere in the work 
which the Father had appointed him, being in all things 
conformed to his will. These promises were often con- 
firmed by an oath. (See Isai. liv. 9, with the context; 
chap. Ixii. 18.) And it is represented as utterly impos- 
sible that these promises should fail. (Isai. xlix. 15, with 
the context ; chap. liv. 10, with the context ; chap, lu 
4 — 8: chap. xl. 8, with the context.). And therefore it 
was impossible that the Messiah should fail, or commit 
sin. 

6. It was tmpom&Ze that the Messiah should fail of per- 
severing in integrity and holiness, as the first Adam did, 
because this would have been inconsistent with the pro- 
mitres which God made to the blessed vii^in his mother, 
and to her husband, implying that he should saw hts peo^ 
pk fr^in their siks ; that Ooc2 woM give him the throne 



$SGT. II« NBCESSAIULT HOLT. 207 

of his father David ; that he $ho%dd reign over the hous^ 
of Jacob forever ; and ih^t of his kingdom there shall 
be no end. These promises were sure, and it was ua- 
possible they should fail. And therefore the Virgin Ma- 
ry, in trusting fully to them, acted reasonably, having an 
immovable foundation of her faith ; as Elizabeth observes, 
ver. 45 : ^^ And blessed is she that 'believeth ; for there 
shall be a performance of those things which were told 
her from the Lord." 

7. That it should have been possible that Christ should 
sio, and so fail in the work of our redemption, does not 
consist with the eternal purpose and decree of God, re* 
vealed in the Scriptures, that be would provide salvation 
for fallen man in und by Jesus Christ, and that salvation 
should be offered to sinners through the preaching of the 
Gospel. Such an absolute decree as this Arminians dq 
not deny. Thus much at least (out of all controversy) is 
implied in such Scriptures as I Cor. ii. 7. £pb. i. 4, 5. 
and obap. iii. 9, 10, 11. 1 Pet. i. 19, 20. Such an abr 
solute deeree as this, Arminians allow to be signified in 
these texts. And the Arminians' election of nations and 
societies, and general election of the Christian church, 
and conditional election of particular persons, imply this. 
God could not decree before the foundation of the world, 
to save all that should believe in, and obey Christ, unless 
be had absolutely decreed that salvation should be provi- 
ded, and effectually wrought out by Christ. And since 
(as the Arminians themselves strenuously maintain) a de- 
cree of God infers necessity ; hence it becomes necessary^ 
that ChrisLshould persevere, and actually work out salva- 
tion for us, and that he should not fail by the commission 
of sin.

8. That It should have been possible for Christ's holi- 
ness to fail| IS not consistent with what God promised to 
bis SOD, before all. ages. For, that salvation should be 
offered to men, through Christ, and bestowed on alt bis 
faithful followers, is what is at least implied in that certain 
and infallible promise spoken of by the apostle, Tit. i. 2: 
"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, pro* 
mised before the world began." This does not seem to 
be controverted by Arminians.* 

9. That it should be possible for Christ to fail of doing 
his Father's will, is inconsistent with the promise made 
to the Father by the Son, by the Logos that was with 
the Father from the beginning, before he took the human 
nature: as may be seen in Psal. xl. 6, 7, 8, (compared 
with the )aposlle's interpretation, Heb. x. 5 — 9). : " Sa- 
crifice and offering thou didst not desire : mine ears hast 
thou opened (or bored) ; burnt-offering and sin-ofiering 
thou hast not required. Then said I, Lo, I come : in the 
volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy 
will, O my God, and thy law is within my heart." Where 
is a manifest allusion to the covenant, which the willing 
servant, who loved his master's service, made with his 
master, to be his servant for ever, on the day wherein he 
had his ear bored ; which covenant was probably inserted 
in the public records, called the volume of the hooJc^ by 
the judges, who were called to take- cognisance of the 
transaction, Exod. xxi. If the Logos, who was with the 
Father before the world, and who made the world, thus 
engaged in covenant to do the will of the Father in the 
human nature, and the promise was as it were recorded,

that it might be made sure, doubtless it was impossible^ 
that it should fail ; and so it was impossible that Christ 
should fail of doiog the will of the Father \n the human 
nature. 

10. If it w^s possible for Christ to have failed of doing 
the will of bis Father, and so to have failed of efiectuallj 
working out redemption for sinners, then the salvation of 
all the saints, wIk> were saved from the beginning of the 
world to the death of Christ, was not built on a 6rm foun- 
dation. The Messiah, and the redemption which he was 
to work out by his obedience unto death, was the founda- 
tion of the salvation of all the posterity of fallen man that 
ever were saved. Therefore, if when the Old Testament 
saints had the pardon of their sins and favor of God 
promised them, and salvation bestowed upon them ; still 
it was possible that the Messiah, when be came, might 
commit sin, then all this was on a foundation that was not 
firm and stable, but liable to fail ; something which it was 
possible might never be. God did as it were trust to what 
his son had engaged and promised to do in future time ; 
and depended so much upon it, that he proceeded actual- 
ly to save men on the account of it, as though it had been 
already done. But this trust and dependence of God,pn 
the supposition of Christ's being liable to fail of doing his 
will, was leaning on a staff that was weak, and might po8*v 
sibly break. The saints of old trusted on the promises of 
a future redemption to be wrought out and completed by 
the Messiah, and built their comfort upon it : Abraham 
saw Christ's day, and rejoiced ; and lie and the other pa* 
triarchs died in the faith of the promise of it. (Heb. xi. 
18.) But on this supposition, their fait{i> and their com- 
iort, and their salvation, was built on a movable^ fallible

foundation ; Christ was not to them a tried stone^ a sure 
foundation, as ifk Isai. xxvrri. 16. David entirely rested 
on the corenant of God with him, concerning the fu- 
ture glorious dominion and salvation of the Messiah, of his 
seed ; says it was.'^ all his salvation, and all his desire ;" 
and comforts himseM" that this covenant was an " everlast- 
ing covenant, ordered in all things and sure,'^ 2 Sdm.. 
xxiii. 5. But if Christ's virtue might hi), he was mista- 
ken : his great comfort was not built so sure as he thought 
it was, being founded entirely on the detenninatiorts of 
the free-wiH of Chrisl*s human soul ; which was subject 
to np necessity, and might be determined either one way 
or the other. Also, the dependence of tliose who look- 
ed for redemption in Jerusalem, and waited for the conso- 
lation of Israel (Luke ii. 25, and 38,) and the confidence 
of the disciples of Jesus, who forsook all and followed 
him, that they might ^njoy the benefits of his future king- 
dom, was biTiIt on a sandy foundation. 

11. The man Christ Jesus, before he had finished his 
course of obedience, and while in the midst of temptations 
and trials, was abundant in positively predicting his own 
future glory in his kingdom, and the enlargement of his 
church, the salvation of the Gentiles through him, etc., 
and in promises of blessings he would bestow on his true 
disciples in his future kingdom ; on which promises he 
required the full dependence of his disciples. (John 
xiv.) But the disciples would have no ground for such 
dependence, if Christ had been liable to fail in his work ; 
and Christ himself would have been guilty of presump- 
tion, in so abounding in peremptory promises of great 
things, which depended on a mere contingence, viz. th^ 
determinations of his free will;i consisting in a freedom 



SECT. II. . ^ NECESSARILY HOLY. Si 1 

ad uintmquey to either sin or holiness, standing in indiffer- 
ence and incident, in thousands of future instances, to go 
either one way of^he other. 

Thus it is evident, that it was impossible that the acts 
of the will of the human soul of Christ should be other- 
wise than holy, and conformed to the will of the Father; 
or, in other words, they were necessarily so conformed. 

I have been the longer in the proof of this matter, it 
being a thing denied by some of the greatest Arminians — 
by Episcopius in particular; and because I look upon it 
as a point clearly and absolutely determining the contro- 
versy between Calvinists and Arminians, concerning the 
necessity of such a freedom of will as is insisted on by the 
latter, in order to the moral agency, virtue, command or 
prohibition, promise or threatening, reward or punishment, 
praise or dispraise, merit or demerit. I now therefore pro- 
ceed, 

II. To consider whether Christ, in his holy behavior 
on earth, was not thus a moral agents subject to com- 
mands, promises, etc. 

Dr. Whitby very often speaks of what 4ie calls a free- 
dom ad uirumlibet, without necessity, as requisite to law 
and commands ; and he speaks of necessity as entirely 
inconsistent with injunctions and prohibitions. But yet 
we read of Christ's being the subject of the commands 
of his Father, Johnx. 18, and xv. 10. And Christ tells 
us, that every tl)ing that he said or did was in compli- 
ance with ** commandments he had received of the Fa- 
ther,'* Joh. xii. 49, 50, and xiv. 31. And we often read 
of Christ's obedience to his Father's commands, Rom. v. 
19. Phil. ii. 18. Heb. v. 8. 

The fore-mentioned writer represents promises offered

a$ motives to persons to do their duty, or a beivg moved 
and induced by promises^ as utterly iDConsisteiit with a 
state wherein persons have not a lib^irty ad utrumlibei^ 
but are necessarily determined to one. (See particularly, 
pp. 298 and 311.) But the thing which this writer as^ 
serts is demonstrably false, if the Christian religion be 
true. If there be any truth in Christianity or the Holy 
Scriptures, the man Christ Jesus had his will infallibly, 
unalterably, and unfrustrably determined to good, and 
that alone ; but yet he had promises of glorious rewards 
made to him, on condition of his persevering in, and 
perfecting, the work which God had. appointed him ; 
Isai. liii. 10, 11, 12. Psal. ii. and ex. Isai.xlix. 7,8,9. 
In Luke xxii. 28, 29, Christ says to his disciples, '^ Ye 
are they which have continued with me in my tempta* 
tions ; and I appoint unto you a kingdom as my Father 
hath appointed unto me." The word most properly sig- 
ni6es to appoint by covenant or promise. The plain 
meaning of Christ's words is this : " As you have par* 
took of my temptations and trials, and have been stead- 
fast, and have overcome, T promise to make you partak- 
ers of my reward, and to give you a kingdom ; as the 
Father has promised me a kingdom (or continuing stead- 
fast, and overcoming in those trials." And the words 
are well explained by those in Rev. iii. 21 : " To him 
that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne ; 
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Fath- 
er in his throne." And Christ had not only promises of 
gbrious success,, and rewards made to his, obedience and 
sufferings, but the Scriptures plainly represent him as 
using tiiese promises for motives and inducements to obey 
and suffer ; and particularly that promise of a kingdom 



SSCr. II. PRAtseWORTEtr, lUSWARDABLti, ETC. SlS 

which the father had appointed him, or sitting with the 
Father on his throne; as in. Heb. xii. 1^ 2: ^' Let us 
lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily 
beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set 
before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of 
our faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endur- 
ed the cross, despising the shame, and is set down on the 
right hand of tlie throne of God." 

And how strange would it be to hear any Christian as- 
sert, that the holy and excellent temper and behavior of 
Jesus Christ, and that obedience which he performed un- 
der such great trials, was not virtuous or praiseworthy^ 
because his will was not free ed utrumque, to either ho- 
liness or sin, but was unalterably determined to one ; that, 
upon this account, tliere is no virtue at all in all Christ's 
humility, meekness, patience, charily, forgiveness of ene- 
mies, contempt of the world, heavenly-mindedness, sub- 
mission to the will of God, perfect obedience to his com- 
mands, (though he was obedient unto death, even the 
death of the cross,) his great compassion to the afflicted, 
his unparalleled love to mankind, his faithfulness to God 
and man under such great trials, his praying for his ene- 
mies, even when nailing him to the cross ; that virtue^ 
when applied to these thingj|, is but an empty name ; 
that there was no merit in any of these things '; that is, 
that Christ was worthy of nothing at all on the account 
of them, worthy of no reward, no praise, no honor or re- 
spect from God or man, because his will was not indiffer- 
ent, and free either to these things or the contrary ; but 
under such a strong inclination or bias to the things that 
were excellent, as made it impossible that he should 
choose the contrary ; that, upon this account, (to use Dr. 



214 Christ's biqutsousitsiss part ui« 

Whitby's language,) U would be sensibly unreasonable 
that the human nature should be rewarded for any of 
these things. 

According to this doctrine, that creature who is evi- 
dently set forth in Scripture as the Jirst bom of every creur 
turey as having in all things the pre-eminence, and as the 
highest of all creatures in virtue, honor, and worthiness of 
esteem, praise, and glory ; on tlie account of bis virtue, 
is less worthy of reward or praise than the very least of 
saints ; yea, no more worthy than a clock or mere ma- 
chine, that is purely passive, and moved by cia^ur^l De7 
cessity. 

If we judge by Scriptural representations of things, we 
have reason to suppose th^t Christ took on him our nature^ 
and dwelt with us in this world, in a suffering state, not 
only to satisfy for our sins, but that he, being in our na- 
ture and circumstances, and under our trials, niight be our 
most fit and proper example, leader, and captain, in the 
exercise of glorious and victorious virtue, and might be a 
visible instance of the glorious end and reward of it ; that 
we might see in him the beauty, amiableness, and true 
honor and glory, and exceeding benefit, of that virtue 
which it is proper for us human beings to practise ; and 
might thereby learn, and be animated, to seek the like 
glory and honor, and to obtain the like glorious reward. 
See Heb. ii. 9 — 14, with v. 8, 9, and xii. 1, 2, 3. John 
XV. 10. Rom. yiii. 17. 2 Tim. ii. 11, 12. I Pet. ii. 19, 
20, and iv. 13. But if there was nothing of any virtue 
or merit, or worthiness of any reward, glory, praise, or 
commendation at all, in all that he did, because it was all 
necessary, apd he could not help it ; then how is here 
anything so proper to animate and incite us, free crea*^

a 

tures, by patient continuance in well-doing, to seek for 
honor, glory, and virtue ? 

God speaks of himself as peculiarly well pleased with 
the righteousness of this servant of his. Isai. xlii. 21 : 
*^ The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake." 
The sacrifices of old are spoken of as a sweet savor to God, 
but the obedience of Christ tls far more acceptable than 
they. Psal. xl. 6, 7 : " Sacrifice and offering thou didst 
not desire ; mine ear hast thou opened [as thy servant per- 
forming willkig obedience] : burnt-ofTering and sin-offer- 
ing hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come [as 
a servant that cheerfully answers the calls of his master] : 
1 delight to do thy will, O niy God, and thy law is with- 
in my heart." Matt. xvii. 5 : " This is my beloved son, in 
whom I am well pleased." And Christ tells us express- 
ly, that the Father loves him for that wonderful instance 
of his obedience, his vokintary yielding himself to death, 
in compliance with the Father's command ; John x. 17, 
18 : " Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay 
down my life. No man taketh it from me ; but I lay it 
down of myself. This commandment received I of my 
Father." 

And if there was no merit in Christ's obedience unto 
death, if it was not worthy of praise and of the most glo- 
rious rewards, the heavenly hosts were exceedingly mis- 
taken, by the account that is given of them in Rev. v. 8 
— 12 : ** The four beasts and the four and twenty elders 
fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them 
harps, and golden vials full of odors. And they sung a 
new song, saying. Thou art worthy to lake the book, 
and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain. And 
I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round 



216 CHR1ST*S RIGHTEOUSNESS PART III. 

about the throne, and the beasts and the elders : and the 
number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, 
and thousands of thousands ; saying with a loud voice, 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, 
and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glo- 
ry, and blessing." 

Christ speaks of the eternal life which he was to re* 
ceive as the reward -of his obedience to tlie Father's com- 
mandments ; John xii. 49, 50 : ^' I have not spoken 
of myself ; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a 
commandment) what I should say, and what I should 
speak. And I know that bis commandment is life ever- 
lasting : whatsoever I speak, therefore, even as the Fa- 
ther said unto me, so I speak." God promises to divide 
bim a portion with the great, etc., for his being his righ- 
teous servant, for his glorious virtue under such great trials 
and afflictions ; Isai. liii. 11, 13 : '< He shall see of the 
travail of his soul, and be satis6ed : by his knowledge 
shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he 'shall bear 
their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion 
with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong ; 
because he hath poured out his soul unto death." The 
Scriptures represent God as rewarding him far above all 
his other servants ; Phil. ii. 7, 8, 9 : "He look on him 
the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of 
men ; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled 
himself, and became obedient unto death, even xke death 
of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted 
him, and given him a name above every name." Psal. 
xlv. 7 : " Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wicked- 
ness ; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with 
the oil of gladness above thy fellows." 



SECT. It« PAAISEWORTHT, REWARDABLE, ETC. 217 

There is no room to pretend that the glorious benefits 
bestowed in consequence of Christ's obedience are not 
properly of the nature of a reward. What is a reward, 
in the most proper sense, but a benefit bestowed in conse- 
quence of something morally excellent in quality or beha- 
vior, in testimony of weli-pleasedness in that moral excel- 
lency, and respect and favor on that account ? If we 
consider the nature of a reward most strictly, and make 
the utmost of it, and add to the things contained in this 
description proper merit or worthiness, and the bestowment 
of the benefit in consequence of a promise ; still it will be 
found there is nothing belonging to it, but that the Scrip- 
ture is most express as to its belonging to the glory be- 
stowed on Christ after his sufferings, as appears from what 
has been already observed : there was a glorious benefit 
bestowed in consequence' of something^ morally excellent, 
being called Righteousness and Obedience ; there was 
great favor, love, and well-pleasedness, for this righteous- 
ness and obedience, in the bestower ; there was proper 
merit, or worthiness of the benefit in the obedience : it was 
bestowed in fulfilment of promises made to that obedi- 
ence ; and was bestowed therefore or because he had per- 
fonned that obedience. 

I may add to all these things, that Jesus Christ, while 
here in the flesh, was manifestly in a state of trial. The 
last Adam, as Christ is called, 1 Cor. xv. 45. Rom. v. 
14, taking on him the human nature, and so the form of a 
servant, aofl being under the law, to stand and act for 
us, was put into a state of trial, as the first Adam was. 
Dr. Whitby mentions these three things as evidences of 
persons being in a state of trial, (on the Five Points, pp. 
298, 299): namely, their aflliciions being spoken of as 

19 



^ 



318 INABILITY ▲NJ> SIN OF SUCH .PART III. 

their trials or temptations^ their being the sub^ts of pro* 
luisesy and their being exposed to Satan's teoiptatiooa. 
But Christ was apparently the subject of each of these. 
Concerning promises made to him, I have spoken alrea* 
dy. The difficulties and afflictians he met with in the 
course of his obedience, are called bis Utnptaiians or <n- 
als ; Luke xxii. 28: '^ Ye are they which have continued 
with me in my temptaiionsy [or triah.Y^ Heb. ii. 18 : 
*^ For in that he himself hath suffered, being temp$ed [or 
tried], he is able to succor them that are tempted/' And 
chap. iv. 15 : '' We have not an high priest which cannot 
be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in 
all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." And 
as to his being tempted by Satan, it is what none' will 
dispute. 

SECTION III. 

THE CASE OF SUCH AS ARE GIVEN UP OF GOD TO SIN, AND OP 
FALLEN MAN IN GENERAL, PROVES MORAL NECESSITY AND 
INABILITY TO BE CONSISTENT WITH BLAMEWORTHINESS. 

Dr. Whitby asserts freedom, not only from co-action, 
but necessity, to be essential to anything deserving the 
name of sin, and to an action's being ailpable^ in these 
words (Discourse on the Five Points, edit. 3. p. 348): 
^^f they be thus necessitated, then neither their sios of omis- 
sion or commission could deserve that name ; it being es- 
sential to the nature of sin, according to St. Austin's defi- 
nition, that it be an action a quo liberum est abstinere. 
Three things seem plainly necessary to make an action or 
omission culpable : 1. TImt it be in our power to perform 
or forbear it ; for as Origen and all the fathers say, no 



SECT. Itl. AS ABC GIVEN UP TO SIN. 219 

man is blamewcMrtby for not doing wiiat he could not do.'' 
And elsevdiiere the doctor insists, that ^< when any do evil 
of necessity, what they do is no v'lfiB, that they are guilty 
of DO fault,"* are worthy of no blame, dispraise,-)* or dis" 
faonor,! but are unblafnable."|| 

If these things are true, in Dr. Whitby's sense of ne*- 
cessity, they will prove all such to be blameless who are 
given up of God to sin, in what they commit after they 
are thus given up. That there is such a thing as men's 
being judicially given up to sin, is certain, if the Scripture 
rightly informs us, such a thing being often there spoken 
of: as in Psal. Ixxxi. 12: ^' So I gave them up to their 
own hearts' lusts, and they walked in their own counsels." 
Acts vii. 42: '^ Then God turned, and gave them up to 
worship the host of heaven." Rom. i. 24 : " Wherefore 
God also gave them up to uncieanness, through the lusts 
of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between 
themselves." Ver. 26 : " For this cause God gave tfaem 
op to vile affections." Ver. 28 : " And even as they did 
not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them 
over to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not 
convenient." 

It is needless to stand particularly to inquire what 
God's giving men up to their own hearts^ lusts signifies : 
it is sufficient to observe, that hereby is certainly meant 
God's so Qi'dering or disposing things, in some respect or 
other, either by doing or ibrbearing to do, as that the con- 
sequence sliould be men's continuing in their sins. So 
much as men are given up to, so much is the consequence

of tbeir being given up, whether that be less or more. 
If God does not order things so, by action or pennission, 
that sin will be the consequence, then the event proves 
that they are not given up to that consequence. If good 
be the consequence, instead of evil, then God's tnevcj is 
to be acknowledged in that good ; which mercy must be 
contrary to God^s judgment in giving up to evil. If the 
event must prove that they are given up to evil as the 
consequence, then the persons who are the subjects of 
this judgment must be the subjects of such an event, and 
so the event is necessary. 

If not only co-action^ but all necesnty, will prove meo 
blameless, then Judas was blameless, after Christ had 
given him over, and had already declared his certain d9m« 
nation, and that he should verily betray him. He was 
guilty of no sin in betraying his Master, on this supposi- 
tion ; though his so doing is spoken of by Christ as the 
most aggravated sin, more heinous than the sin^of Pilate 
in crucifying him. And the Jews in Egypt, in Jeremiah's 
time, were guilty of no sin, in their not worshipping the 
true God, after God had '^ sworn by his great name, that 
his name should be no more named in the mouth of any 
man of Judah, in all the land of Egypt." Jer. xliv. 2& 

Dr. Whilby (Disc, on the Five Points, pp. 302, 303) 
denies that men, in this world, are ever so given up by 
God to sin, that their wills should be necessarily deter- 
mined to evil ; though he owns, that hereby it may be- 
come exceeding difficult for men to do good, having a 
strong bent and powerful inclination to what is evil. — But 
if we should allow the case to be just as he represents, 
the judgment of giving up to sin will no better agree with 
his notions of that liberty which is essential to praise or 



steer. lit. AS. AUG given up to sin. • 221 

bhme, than if we should suppose it to render the avoid- 
ing of sin impossible. For if an impossibility of avoiding 
sin wholly excuses a man, then, for the same reason, its 
being difficult to avoid it excuses him in part, and this 
jost in proportion to the <jlegree of difficulty. If the in- 
ikience of moral impossibility or inability be the same, to 
excuse persons in not doing, or not avoiding anything, as 
that of natural inability (which is supposed), then un- 
doubtedly, in like manner, moral difficulty has the same 
influence to excuse with natural difficulty. But all al- 
low that natural impossibility wholly excuses, and also 
that natural difficuity excuses in part, and makes the act 
or omission less blaraable in proportion to the difficulty. 
All natural difficulty ^ according to the plainest dictates of 
the ligiu of nature, excuses in some degree, so that the 
neglect is not so biamable, as if there bad been no diffi- 
culty in the case : and so the greater the difficulty is, still 
the more excusable, in proportion to the increase 6f the 
difficulty. And as natural impossibility wholly excuses 
and excludes all blame, so the nearer the difficulty ap- 
proaches to impossibility, still the nearer a person is to 
blamelessness in proportion to that approach. And if the 
caseof moral impossibility or necessity be just the same with 
natural necessity or co-action, as to influence to excuse a 
neglect, then also, for the same reason, the case of natu- 
ral difficulty does not differ in influence, to excuse a ne- 
gleet, (rom moral difficulty, arising from a strong bias or 
bent to evil, such as Dr. Whitby owns in the case of 
those that are given up to their own hearts' lusts. So 
that the fault of such persons must be lessened, in pro- 
portion to the difficulty, and approach to impossibility. 
If ten degrees of moral difficulty make the action quite 

19* 



222 INABILITY AND SIN OF StTCH PART III< 

impossible, and so wliolly excuse, theii if there be nine 
degrees of difficulty, the person is in great part excused, 
and is nine degrees in ten less blameworthy than if there 
had been no difficulty at all ; and he has but one degree 
of blameworthiness. The Reason is plain, on Arminian 
principles, viz. because as difficulty, by antecedent bent 
and bias on the will, is increased, liberty of indifference, 
and self-determination in the will, is diminished : so much 
hinderance and impediment is there in the way of the 
will's acting freely, by mere self^determinatbn. And if 
ten degrees of such hinderance take away all such liberty, 
then nine degrees take away nine parts in ten, and leave 
but one degree of liberty. And therefore there is but one 
degree of blamableness, c<eieris paribuSy in the neglect ; 
the man being no further blamable in what he does or 
neglects than he has liberty in tliat affair : for blame or 
praise (say they) arises wholly from a good use or abuse 
of liberty. 

From all which it follows, that a strong bent and bias 
one way, and difficulty of going the contrary, never causes 
a person to be at all more exposed to sin, or anything 
blamable : because, as the difficulty is increased, so much 
the less is required and expected. Though in one respect 
exposedness to sin or fault is increased, viz. by an in* 
crease of exposedness to the evil action or omission, yet it 
is diminished in another respect to balance it, namely,. as 
the sinfulness or blamableness of the action or omission is 
diminished in the same proportion. So that, on the whole, 
the affair, as to exposedness to guilt or blame, is left just 
as it was. 

To illustrate this, let us suppose a scale of a balance to 
be intelligent, and a free agent, and indued with a self- 



SECT. lit. AS ARK GIVEN UP TO 6IN. 223 

moving power, by virtue of which it coald act and pro- 
duce efiects to a cegain degree, ex. gr* to move itself up 
or down with a force to a weight of ten pounds ; and that 
it might therefore be required of it, in ordinary circum- 
stances, to move itself down with that force ; for which it 
has power and full liberty, and therefore would be blame- 
worthy if it failed of it. But then let us suppose a weight 
of ten pounds to be put in the opposite scale, which in 
force entirely counterbalances its self-moving power, and 
so renders it impossible for it to move down at all ', and 
therefore wholly excuses it from any such motion. But 
if we suppose there to be only nine pounds in the oppo- 
site scale, this renders its motion not impossible, but yet 
more difficult ; so that it can now only move down with 
the force of one pound : but, however, this is all that is 
required of it under these circumstances ; it is wholly ex- 
cused from nine parts of its motion : and if the scale, un- 
der these circumstances, neglects to move, and remains at 
rest, all that it will be blamed for, will be its neglect of 
that one-tenth part of its motion ; which it had as much 
liberty and advantage for, as in usual circumstances it has 
for the greater motion which in such a case would be re- 
quired. So that this new difficulty does not at all increase 
its exposedness to anything blameworthy. 

And thus the very supposition of difficulty in the way 
of a rain's duty^ or proclivity to sin, through a being given 
up to bardn^s of heart, or indeed by any other means 
whatsoever, is an inconsistence, according to Dr. Whitby's 
notions of liberty, virtue and vice, blame and praise. The 
avoiding sin and blame, and the doing what is virtuous 
and praiseworthy, must be always equally easy. 

Dr. Whitby's notions of liberty, cAUgation, virtue, sin, 



224 INABtLITT or r ALLEN VAN. 1»ART III. 

etc. lead bim toto another great inconsistence. He abiin^ 
dantly insists, that necessity is incoiyistent with the na*^ 
tuire of sin or faalt. He says, in the fore-mentioned trea** 
tise, p. 14, Who can blame a person for doing what he 
eotUd not help 1 And page 15, It being sensibly unjust 
to punish any man for doing that which was net>tr in 
his power to avoid. And in p. 341, to confirm his opin* 
ion, he quotes one of the fathers, saying, Why ioth Ood 
command^ if man hath not free wiU and power to obey t 
And again, in the same and the next page. Who mil not 
cry out J that it is folly to command him that hath not lib* 
erty to do what is commanded; and that it is unjust to 
condemn him that has it not in his power to do what is 
required 1 And in p. 373, he cites another, saying, A law 
is given to him that can turn to both parts ; i. e. obey or 
transgress it ; but no law can be against him who is bound 
by nature^ 

And yet the same Dr. Whitby asserts, that fallen man 
is not able to perform perfect obedience. In p. 165, he 
has these words : <' The nature of Adam had power to 
continue innocent and without sin ; whereas it is certain 
our nature never had." But if we ha%'e not power to 
continue innocent and without sin, then sin is inconsistent 
with necessity, and we may be sinful in that which we 
have not power to avoid ; and those things cannot be true, 
which he asserts elsewhere, namely, " That if we be ne- 
cessitated neither sins of omission nor commission would 
deserve that name," (p. 348.) If we have it not in our 
power to be innocent, then we have it not in our power 
to be blameless ; and if so, we are under a necessity of 
being blameworthy. And how does this consist with 
what he so often asserts, that necessity is inconsistent with 



- SECT. Iir. INABILITY OF FALLEN MAN. 229 

blame or praise ? If we have it not in our power to per^^ 
form perfect obedience to all the commands of God, then 
we are under a necessity of breaking some commands^ in 
some degree ; having no power to perform so much as is 
commanded. And if so, why does he cry out of the uu^ 
reasonableness and folly of commanding beyond what men 
have power to do ? 

And Arminians in general are very inconsistent with 
themselves in what they say of the inability of fallen man 
in this respect. They strenuously maintain, that it would 
be unjust in God to require any thing of us beyond our 
present power and ability to perform ; and also hold, that 
we are now unable to perform perfect obedience, and that 
Christ died to satisfy for the imperfections of our obedi' 
ence, and has made way, that our imperfect obedience 
might be accepted instead of perfect : wherein they seem 
insensibly to run themselves into the grossest inconsist- 
ence. For, (as I have observed elsewhere) " they hold, 
that God, in mercy to mankind, has abolished that rigo- 
rous constitution or law that they were under originally ; 
and instead of it, has introduced a more mild constitution, 
and put us under a new law, which requires no more than 
imperfect sincere obedience, in compliance with our poor, 
infirm, impotent circumstances since the fall." 

Now, how can these things be made consistent ? I 
would ask, what law these imperfections of our obedience 
are a breach of? If they are a breach of no law that we 
were ever under, then they are not sins. And if they be 
not sins, what need of Christ's dying to satisfy for them ? 
But if they are sins, and the breach of some, law, what law 
is it ? They cannot be a breach of their new law ; for 
that requires no other than imperfect obedience, or ob^* 



d26 INABILITT Of rALLKtt MAN. PART III. 

dience with imperfections : and therefore to have obedi* 
ence attended with imperfections, is no breach of it ; for 
it is as much as it requires. And they cannot be a breach 
of their old law ; for that, they say, is entirely abolished ; 
and we never were under it.-— They say it would not be 
just in Crod to require of us perfect obedience, because it 
would not be just to require more than we can perform, or 
to punish us for failing of it. And, therefore, by their 
own scheme, the imperfections of our obedience do not 
deserve to be punished. What need, therefore, of Christ's 
dying to satisfy for them ? What need of his sufferings 
to satisfy for that which is no feuh, and in its own nature 
deserves no suffering? What need of Christ's dying to 
purchase, that our imperfect obedience should be accep* 
ted, when, according to their scheme, it would be unjus( 
in itself, that any other obedience than imperfect should 
be required ? What need of Christ's dying to make way 
for God's accepting such an obedience as it would be un* 
just iu him not to accept ? — ^Is there any need of Christ's 
dying to prevail with God not to do unrighteously ? — If it 
be said, that Christ died to satisfy that old law for us, 
that so we might not be under it, but that there might be 
room for our being under a more mild law ; still I would 
inquire, what need of Christ's dying, that we might not 
be under a law, which (by their principles) it would be in 
itself unjust that we should be under, whether Christ had 
died or no, because in our present state, we are not able 
to keep it ? 

So the Arminians are inconsistent with themselves, not 
only in what they say of the need of Christ's satisfaction 
to atone for those imperfections which we cannot avoid, 
but also in what they say of the grace of God, granted to 



aSCT. iy« COMHASHS GORSISTENTi KTC. 227 

enable men to perform the sincere obedience of the new 
law. ^' I grant (says Dr. Stebbing**) indeed, that by reason 
of original sin, we are utterly disabled ibr the performance 
of tbe condition, without new grace from God. But I 
say tlien, that be gives such a grace to all of us, by which 
the performance of the condition is truly possible : and 
upon this ground he may and doth most righteously re- 
quire it." If Dr. Stebbing [intends to speak properly, by 
grace he must mean, that assistance which is of grace, or 
of free favor and kindness. But yet in the same place 
he speaks of it as very unreasonable^ unjiist, and cruely 
for God to require that, as the condition of pardon, that is 
become impossible by original sin. If it be so, what 
grace is there in giving assistance and ability to petrfonn 
the condition of pardon? Or why is that called by tbe 
name of grace, that is an absolute debt, which God is 
bound to bestow, and which it would be unjust and cruel 
in him to withold, seeing he requires that as the condition^ 
ofpardofiy which he cannot perform without it ? 

SECTION IV. 

COMMAND AND OBLIGATION TO OBEDIENCE CONSISTENT WITH 

MORAL INABILITY TO OBEY. 

It being so much insisted on by Arrainian writers, that 
necessity is inconsistent with law or command, and par- 
ticularly, that it is absurd to suppose God by his com- 
mand, should require that of men which they are unable 
to do ; not allowing in this case for any difference that 
there is between natural and moral inability ; I would 
therefore now particularly consider this matter. 

* Treatise of the Operationfl of the Spirit. 2d edit. pp. 112, 113. 



328 COMMANDS CONSISTENT PART III. 

And, for the greater clearness, T would distinctly lay 
down the following things. 

I. The will itself, and not only those actions which are 
the effects of the will, is the proper object of precept or 
command. That is, such or such a state or acts of men's 
wills is in many cases properly required of them by com* 
mands ; and not only those alterations in the state of tlieir 
bodies or minds that are the consequences of volition. 
This is most manifest ; for it is the soul only that is pro- 
perly and directly the subject of precepts or commands ; 
that only being capable of receiving or perceiving com* 
mands. The motions or state of the body are matter of 
command, only as they are subject to the soul, and con- 
nected with its acts. But now the soul has no other fac- 
tthy whereby it can, in the most direct and proper sense, 
consent, yield to, or comply with, any command, but the 
faculty of the will ; and it is by this faculty only, that the 
^oul can directly disobey, or refuse compliance ; for the 
very notions of comenting, yieldingy accepting^ comply* 
ingi refusings rejecting, etc. are, according to the mean- 
ing of the terms, nothing but certain acts of the will. 
Obedience, in the primary nature of it, is the submitting 
and yielding of the will of one to the will of another. 
Disobedience is the not consenting, not complying of the 
will of the commanded to the manifested will of the com- 
mander. Other acts that are not the acts of the will, as 
certain motions of the body and alterations in the soul, are 
obedience or disobedience only indirectly, as they aus con- 
nected with the state or actions of the will, accotding to 
an established law of nature. So that it is manifest, the 
will itself may be required: and the being of a good will 
is the most proper, direct, and immediate subject of com- 



8CCT. IV. WITH MORJbL INABILITY. St89 

mand ; and if this cannot be prescribed or required hj 
command or precept, nothing can ; for other things can 
be required no otherwise than as they depend upon, and 
are the fruits of, a good ^\\L 

CoroL 1. If there be several acts of the will, or a seriet 
of acts, one following another, and one the effect of ano- 
ther, the Jirst and determining act is properly the subject 
of command, and not only the Consequent acts, which are 
dependent upon it. Yea, this more especially is that 
to which command or precept has a proper respect; 
because it is this act that determines the whole affair: 
in this act the obedience or disobedience lies/in a peculiar 
manner; the consequent acts being all subject to it, and 
governed and determined by it. This determining gov- 
erning act must be the proper object of precept, or none. 

Corol. 2. It also follows, from what has been observed, 
that if there be any sort of act or exertion of the soul, 
prior to all free acts of the will or acts of choice in the 
case, directing and determining what the acts of the will 
shall be ; that act or exertion of the soul cannot properly 
he subject to any command or precept, in any respect 
whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, immediately or 
remotely. Such acts cannot be subject to commands iK- 
rectlj/y because they are no acts of the will ; being by the 
supposition prior to all acts of the will, detennining and 
giving rise to all its acts : they not being acts of the will, 
there can be in them no consent to, or compliance with, 
any command. Neither can they be subject to command 
or precept indirectli/ or remotely; for they are not so 
much as the effects or consequences of the will, being pri« 
or to all its acts. So that if there be any obedience in 
that original act of the soul, determining^ all volitions, it ia 

20 



230 COMMANDS CONSISTKNT PART III. 

an act of obedience wherein the will has no concern at all ; 
it preceding every act of wilL And, therefore, if the soul 
either obeys or disobeys in this act, it is wholly involun- 
tarily ; there is no willing obedience or rebellion, no com- 
pliance or opposition of the will in the affiiir : and what 
sort of obedience or rebellion is this? 

And thus the Arminian notion of the freedom of the 
will consisting in the soul's determining its own acts of 
will, instead of being essential to moral agency, and to 
men's being the subjects of moral government, is utterly 
inconsistent with it. For if the soul determines (til its 
acts of will, it is therein subject to no command or moral 
government, as has been now observed ; because its ori- 
ginal determining act is no act of will or choice, it being 
prior, by the supposition, to every act of will. And the 
soul cannot be the subject of command in the act of the 
will itself, which depends on the foregoing determining 
. act, and is determined by it ; inasmuch as this is necessa- 
ry, being the necessary consequence and effect of that 
prior determining act, which is not voluntary. ^ Nor can 
the man be the subject of command or government in his 
external actions ; because these are all necessary, being 
the necessary effects of the acts of the will themselves. 
So that mankind, according to this scheme, are subjects of 
command or moral government in nothing at all ; and all 
their moral agency is entirely excluded, and no room for 
virtue or vice in the world. 

So that it is the Arminian scheme, and not the scheme 
of the Calvinists, that is utterly inconsistent with moral 
government, and with all use of laws, precepts, prohibi- 
tions, promises, or threatenings. Neither is there any 
way whatsoever to make their principles consist with 



SECT. IV. WITH MOILAL INABILITY. S31 

these things. For if it be said, that there is do prior de* 
determining act of the soul, preceding the acts of the will, 
but that volitions are events that come to pass by pure 
accident, without any determining cause, this is most pal- 
pably inconsistent with all use of laws and precepts ; for 
nothing is more plain than that laws can be of ho use to 
direct and regulate^ perfect accident; which, by the sup- 
position of its being pure accident, is in no case regulated 
by anything preceding ; but happens, this way or that, 
perfectly by chance, without any cause or rule. The 
perfect uselessness of laws and precepts also follows from 
the Arminian notion of indifierence, as essential to that 
liberty which is requisite to virtue or vice. For the end 
of laws is to bind io one side ; aild the end of commands 
is to turn the will one way : and therefore they are of no 
use uniess they turn or bias the will that way.^ But if lib- 
erty consists in indifierence, then their biassing the will one 
way only, destroys liberty ; as it puts the will out of 
equilibrium. So that the will, having a bias, through the 
influence of binding law, laid upon it, is not wholly left to 
itself, to determine itself which way it will, without influ- 
ence from without. 

II. Having shown that the will itself, especially in those 
acts which are original, leading and determining in any 
case, is the proper subject of precept and command, and 
not only those alterations in the body, etc. which are the 
eflects of the will; I now proceed, in the second place, to 
observe, that the very opposition or defect of the will it- 
self, in that act which is its original and determining act 
in ,the case ; I say, the will's opposition iw this act to a 
thing proposed or commanded, or its failing of compliance, 
implies a moral inability to that thing : or, in other words, 



S3S COMMANDS CONSISTENT PART III. 

whenever a conimand requires a certain state or act of the 
willy and the person commanded, ftotwitbsianding the 
oompand and the circumstances under which it is exhibi- 
ted} still finds his will opposite or wanting, in thai, belong* 
ing to its state or acts, which u original and determining 
in the affair, that man is morally unable to obey tbal^ 
command. 

This is manifest from what was observed in the first 
part, concerning tlie nature of moral inability, as distin- 
guished from natural: where it was observed, that a man 
may then be said to be morally unable to do a thing, when 
he is under the influence or prevalence of a contrary in- 
clination ; or has a want of inclination^ under such circum- 
stances and views. It is also evident, from what has been 
before proved, that the will is always, and in every indi- 
vidual act, necessarily determined by the strongest motive ; 
and so is always unable to go against the motive, which, 
all things considered, has now the greatest strength and 
advantage to move the will. But not further to in§ist on 
these things, the truth of the position now laid down, viz* 
that when the will is opposite to, or failing of a compli- 
ance with a thing in its original determining inclination 
or act, it is not able to comply, appears by the considera- 
tion of these two things. 

1. The will in the time of that diverse or opposite lead- 
ing act or inclination, and when actually under the influ- 
ence of it, is not able to exert itself to the contrary, to 
make an alteration, in order to a compliance. The incli- 
nation is unable to change itself; and that for this plain 
reason, that it is unable to incline to change- itself. Pre- 
sent choice cannot at present choose to be otherwise : for 
that would be at present to choose something diverse from 



SKCT. IT. WITH MORAL INABILITY. $233 

what is at present chosen. If the will, all tilings now 
considered, inclines or chooses to go that way ; then it 
cannot choose, nil things now considered, to go the other 
way, and so cannot choose to be made to go the other 
way. To suppose that the mind is now sincerely inclined 
to change itself to a different inclination, is to suppose 
the mind is now truly inclined otherwise than it is now 
inclined. The will may oppose some future remote 
act that it is exposed to, but not its own present act. 

2. As it is impossible that the will should comply with 
the thing commanded, with respect to its leading act^ by 
any act of its own, in the time of that diverse or opposite 
leading and original act, or after it has actually come 
under the iiifluence of that determining choice or inclina- 
tion ; so it is impossible it should be determined to. a com-, 
pliance iy any foregoing act ; for, by the very supposi- 
tion, there is no foregoing act ; the opposite or non-com- 
plying act being that act which is original and determining 
in the case. Therefore it must be so, that if this Jint 
determining act be found non-complying, on the proposal 
of the command, the mind is morally unable to obey. 
For to suppose it to be able to obey, is to suppose it to 
be able i& determine and cause its Jirjst determining act 
to be otherwise, and that it has power better to govern 
and regulate \is first governing and regulating act^ which 
is absurd ; for it is to suppose a prior act of the will, de- 
termining its first determining act ; that is, an act prior to 
the first, and leading and governing the original and go- 
verning act of all ; which is a contradictidn. 

Here if it should be» said, that although the mind has 
not any ability to will contrary to what it does will, in the 
original and leading act of the will, because there is sup- 

20* 



234 COMMANDS COlVSlSTCNr FART UU 

posed to be no prior act to determine and order it other- 
wise, and the will cannot immediately change itself, be- 
cause it cannot at present incline to a change ; yet, the 
mind has an ability for the present to forbear to proceed 
to action, and taking time lor deliberation ; which may be 
an occasion of the change of the inclination. 

I answer, (1) In this objection that seems to be forgot- 
ten which was observed before, viz. that the determining 
to take the matter into consideration, is itself an act of the 
will ; and if this be all the act wherein the mind exerci- 
ses ability and freedom, then this, by the supposition, 
must be all that can be commanded or required \)y pre- 
cept. And if this act be the commanding act, then all 
that has been observed concerning the commanding act 
of the will remains true, that the very want of it is a mo- 
ral inability to exert it, etc. (2) We are speaking con- 
cerning the 6rst and leading act of the will in the case, 
or about the affair; and if a detennining to deliberate, or, 
on the contrary, to proceed immediately without delibera- 
ting, be the first and leading act ; or whether it be or no, 
if there be another act before it, which determines that; 
or whatever be the original and leading act ; still, the 
foregoing proof stands good, that the noii-coiiSpliance of 
the leading act implies moral inability to comply. 

If it should he objected, that these things make all mo- 
ral inability equal, and suppose men morally unable to 
will otherwise than they actually do will, in all cases, and 
equally so in every instance ; 

In answer to this objection, I desire two things may be 
observed. Firsts That if by being equally unable be 
Bieant as reaUy unable; then, so far as tbe inability is 
merely moral, it is true, the w'dl, in every instance, acts 



SfiCT. IV. > WIT^ MORAP INABILITY. 235 

by moral necessity, and is morally unable to act otherwise, 
as truly and properly in one case as another ; as, I hum*- 
bly conceive, has been perfectly and abundantly demon- 
strated by what has been said in the preceding part of 
this essay. But yet, in some respect, the inability may 
be said to be greater in some instances than others : 
though the man may be triiiy unable, (if moral inability 
can truly be called inability), yet he may be further from 
being able to do some things than others ; as it is in things 
which men are naturally unable to do. A person, whose 
strength is no more than sufficient to Tift the weight of 
one hundred pounds, is as truly and really unable to lift 
one hundred and one pounds, as ten thousand pounds ; 
but yet he is further from being able to lift the latter 
weight than the former ; and so, according to common 
use of speech, has a greater inability for it. So it is in 
moral inability. A man is truly morally unable to choose 
contrary to a present inclination, which in the least de- 
gree prevails ; or contrary to that motive which, all thiitgs 
considered, has strength and advantage now to move the 
will, in the least degree, superior to all other motives in 
view : but yet he is further from ability to resist a very 
strong habit, and a violent and deeply-rooted inclmatidn, 
or a motive vastly exceeding all others in strength. And 
again, the inability may in some respects, be called great- 
er in some instances than others, as it may be more gen^ 
era! and extensive to all acts of that Jchid. So, men may 
be said to be unable in a different sense, and to be further 
from moral ability, who have that moral inability which 
is general and habitual, than they who have only that in- 
ability which is occasional and particular.* Thus, in ca-

ses of natural inability ; he that is bom blind may be said 
to be unable to see, in a different manner, and is, in sonie 
respects, further from being able to see, than he whose 
sight is hindered by a transient cloud or mist. 
, And besides, that which was observed in the first part 
of this discourse, concerning the inability which attends a 
${rong and settled habit, should be here remembered ; 
viz., that fixed habit is attended with this peculiar moral 
inability, by which it is distinguished from occasional tro- 
lition, namely, that endeavors to avoid future volitions of 
that kind, which are agreeable to such a habit, much more 
frequently and commonly prove vain and insufficiejit. 
For though it is impossible there should be any true 
sincere desires and endeavors against a present voli- 
tion or choice, yet there may be against volitions of 
that kind, when viewed at a distance* A person may de* 
sire and use means to prevent future exercises of a cer- 
tain inclination ; and, in order to it, may wish the habit 
might be removed ; but his desires and endeavors may 
be ineffectual. The man may be said in some sense to be 
unable ; yea, even as the word unable is a relative term, 
and has relation to ineffectual endeavors ; yet not with re- 
gard to present, but remote endeavors. 

Secondly^ It must be borne in mind, according to what 
was observed before, that indeed no inability whatsoever, 
which is merely moral, is properly called by the name of 
inability ; and that in the strictest propriety of speech, 
a man may be said to have a thing in his power, if he has 
it at his election ; and he cannot be said to be unable to 
do a thing, when he can, if he now pleases, or whenever 
he has a proper, dii*ect, and immediate desire for it. At 
to those desires and endeiivors that may be against the 



SECT* 17. WITH MORAL INABILITT. 237 

exercises of a strong habit, with regard to which men may 
be said to be unable to avoid those exercises, they are re- 
mote desires and endeavors in two respects. First y as to 
time : they are never against present volitions, but only 
against volitions of such a kind, when viewed at a dis- 
tance. Secondlyy as to their nature : these opposite de- 
sires are not directly and properly against the habit and 
inclination itself, or the volitions in which it is exercised ; 
for tiiese, in themselves considered, are agreeable ; but 
against something else that attends them, or is their con- 
sequence : the opposition of the mind is levelled entirely 
against this; the inclination or volitions themselves are 
cot at alt opposed directly, and for their own ^ake ; but 
only indirectly and remotely, on the account of something 
alien and foreign. 

III. Though the opposition of the will itself, or the very 
want of wiU, to a thing commanded, implies a moral ina- 
bility to that thing ; yet, if it be, as has been already 
shown, that the being of a good state or act of will, is a 
thing most properly required by command ; then, in some 
cases, such a state or act of will may properly be requi- 
red, winch at present is not, and which may also be want- 
ing after it is commanded. And therefore those things 
may properly be comnAinded, which men have a moral 
inability for. 

Such a state, or act of the will may be required by 
command as does not already exist. For if that volition 
only may be commanded to be which already is, there 
could be no use of precept ; commands in all cases would 
be perfectly vain and impertinent. And not only may 
such a will be required, as is wanting before the command 
is given, but also such as may possibly be wanting after* 



fids COMMANDS CONSISTENT PART lil» 

wards ; such as the exhibition of the command may not 
be effectual to produce or excite. Otherwise, no such 
thing as disobedience to a proper and rightful command 
is possible in any case: and there is no case supposable 
or possible wherein there can be an inexcusable or faulty 
disobedience. Which Arminians canpot affirm, consist 
tently with their principles : for this makes obedience to 
just and proper commands always necessary, and disobe* 
dience impossible. And so the Arminian would overthrow 
himself, yielding the very poiut we are upon, which be 
so strenuously denies, viz. that law and command are 
consistent with necessity. 

If merely that inability will excuse disobedience, which 
is implied in the opposition or defect of inclination re* 
maining after the command is exhibited, then wickedness 
always carries that in it which excuses it. It is evermore 
so, that by how much the more wickedness there is in a 
man's heart, by so much is bis inclination to evil the 
stronger, and by so much the more, therefore^ has he of 
moral inability to the good required. His moral inability, 
consisting in the strength of his evil inclination, is the 
very thing wherein his wickedness consists : and yet, ac- 
cording to Arminian principles, it must be a thing incon- 
sistent with wickedness; and by how much the more he 
has of it, by so much is he the further from wickedness. 

Therefore on the whole, it is manifest, that moral ina- 
bility alone (which consists in disinclination) never renders 
anything improperly the subject matter of precept or 
command, and never can excuse any person in disobedi- 
ence or want of conformity to a command. 

Natural inability, arising from the want of natural' ca- 
pacity, or external hindrance (which alone is properly 



8ECT. IV. WITH liOtlAL tNABlLITt. 239 

« 

called inability), without doubt wholly excuses, or makes 
a thing improperly the matter of command. If men are 
excused from doing or acting any good thing, supposed to 
be commanded, it must be through some defect or obsta- 
cle that is not in the will itself, but intrinsic to it; either 
in the capacity of understanding, or body, or outward cir- 
cumstances. 

Here two or three things may be observed : 
1. As to spiritual duties or acts, or any good thing in 
the state or imminent acts of the will itself, or of the affec- 
tions (which are only certain modes of the exercise of the 
will), if persons are justly excused, it must be through 
want of capacity in the natural faculty of understanding. 
Thus the same spiritual duties, or holy affections and exer- 
cises of heart, cannot be required of men as may be of 
angels ; the capacity of understanding being so mi^ch in- 
ferior. So, men cannot be required to love those amiable 
persons whom they have had no opportunity to see, or 
hear of, or come to the knowledge of, in any way agree- 
able to the natural state and capacity of the human under- 
standing. But the insufficiency of motives will not ex- 
cuse ; unless their being insufficient arises not from the 
moral state of the will or inclination itself, but from the 
state of the natural understanding. The great kindness 
and generosity of another may be a motive insufficient to 
excite gratitude in the person that receives the kindness, 
through his vile and ungrateful temper : in this case, the 
insufficiency of the motive arises from the state of the will 
or inclination of heart, and does not at all excuse. 
But if this generosity is not sufficient to excite gratitude, 
being unknown, there being no means of information ade- 
quate to the state and measure of the person's faculties, 



340 COMMANDS CONSISTENT PART III* 

« 

this insufficiency is attended with a natural inability, which 
entirely excuses. 

2. As to such motions of body, or exercises and altera- 
tions of mind, which do not consist in the imminent acts 
or state of tlie will itself, but are supposed to be required 
as efiects of the will ; I say, in such supposed eflfects o( the 
will, in cases wherein there is no want of a capacity of un- 
derstanding, that inability, and that only, excuses, which 
consists in want of connection between them and the will. 
If the will fully complies, and the proposed effect does not 
prove, according to the laws of nature, to be connected 
with his volition, the man is perfectly excused : he has a 
natural inability to the thing required. For the will itself, 
as has been observed, is all that can be directly and im- 
mediately required by command ; and other things only 
indirectly, as connected with the will. If, thfrefore, there 
be a full compliance of will, the person has done his duty ; 
and if other things do not prove to be connected' with his 
volition, that is not owing to him. 

3. Both these kinds of natural inability that have been 
mentioned, and so all inability that excuses, may be re- 
solved into one thing ; namely, want of natural capacity 
or strength ; either capacity of understanding, or external 
strength. For when there are external defects and ob- 
stacles, they would he no obstacles, were it not for the 
imperfection and limitations of understanding and strength. 

Corol. If things for which men have a moral inability 
may properly be the matter of precept or command, then 
they may also of invhation and counsel. Commands and 
invitations come very much to the same thing ; the differ- 
ence is only circumstantial : commands are as much a 
manifestation of the will of him that speaks, as invitations, 



S£CT. V. WITH MORAL INABILITY. 241 

and as much testimonies of expectation of compliance. 
The difference between them lies in nothing that touches 
the affair in hand. The main difference between com- 
mand and invitation consists in the enforcement of the will 
of him who commands or invites. In the latter it is his 
kindness^ the goodness which his will arises from : in the 
former it is his authority. But whatever be the ground 
of the will of him that speaks, or the enforcement of what 
be says, yet seeing neither his will nor expectation is any 
more tes^i6ed in the one case than the other, therefore a 
person's being directed by invitation^ is no more an evi- 
dence of insincerity in him that directs, in manifesting 
either a will or expectation which he has not, than his be- 
ing known to be morally unable to do what he is direc- 
ted to by command. So that all this grand objection of 
Arminians against the inability of fallen men to exert faith 
in Christ, or to perform other spiritual gospel duties, from 
the sinci^rity of God's counsels and invitations, must be 
without force. 

SECTION V. 

THAT SINCERITY OF DESIRES AND ENDEAVORS, WHICH IS SUP- 
POSED TO EXCUSE IN THE NON-PERFORMANCE OF THINGS 
IN THEMSELVES GOOD, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED. 

It is what is much insisted on by many, that some men, 
though they are not able to perform spiritual duties, such 
as repentance of sin, love to God, a cordial acceptance of 
Christ as exhibited and offered in the gospel, etc.^ yet 
they may sincerely desire and endeavor these things, and 
therefore most be excused ; it being unreasonable to blaine 

21 



342 WHAT WILLINGMB8S AND PART III. 

tbem for the omission of those things which they sincerely 
desire and endeavor to do^ but cannot do. 

Concerning this' matter, the following things may be 
observed : 

1 . What is here supposed, is a great mistake, and gross 
absurdity ; even that men may sincerely choose and de» 
sire those spiritual duties of love, acceptance, choice, re- 
jection, etc., consisting in the exercise of the will itself, or 
in the disposition and inclination of the heart ; and yet 
not be able to perform or exert them. This is absurd, 
because it is absurd to suppose that a man should directly, 
properly, and sincerely incline to have an inclination which 
at the same time is contrary to his inclination ; for that is 
to suppose him not to be inclined to that which he is in- 
clined to. If a man, in the state and acts of his will and 
inclination does properly and directly fall in whh those du- 
ties, he therein performs them : for the duties themselves 
consist in that very thing ; they consist in the state and 
acts of the will being so formed and directed. If the 
soul properly and sincerely falls in with a certain proposed 
act of will or choice, the soul therein makes that choice 
its own. Even as when a moving body falls in with a 
proposed direction of its motion, that is the same thing as 
to move in that direction. 

2. That which is called a desire and willingness for 
those inward duties, in such as do not perform, has respect 
to these duties only indirectly and remotely, and is im- 
properly represented as a willingness for them ; not only 
because (as was observed before) it respects those good 
volitions only in a distant view, and with respect to future 
firoe ; but also because evermore, not these things them^ 



SCCT.' V. SINCERITY IS NO EXCUSE. 243 

selves, but somethiitg ^Ise^ that is alien and foreign, is the 
object that terminates tb^se volitions and desires. 

A drunkard, who continues in his drunkenness, being 
under the power of a love and violent appetite to strong 
drink, and without any love to virtue, but being also ex- 
tremely covetous and close, and very much exercised 
and grieved at the diminution of his estate, and prospect 
of poverty, may in a sort desire the virtue of temperance ; 
and though his present will is to gratify his extravagant 
appetite, 'yet he may wish he had a heart to forbear future 
acts of intemperance, and forsake his excesses through an 
unwillingness to part with his money : but still he goes 
on with his drunkenness ; his wishes and endeavors are 
insuffipient and ineffectual : such a man has no proper, 
direct, sincere willingness to forsake this vice, and the 
vicious deeds which belong to it ; for he acts voluntarily 
in continuing to drink to excess : his desire is very im* 
properly called a willingness to be temperate ; it is no true 
desire of that virtue, for it is not that virtue that terminates 
bis wishes, nor have they any direct respect at all to it« 

It is only the saving his moneys and avoiding poverty, 
that terminates and exhausts the whole strength of his de- 
sire. The virtue of temperance is regarded only very 
indirectly and improperly, even as a necessary means of 
gratifying the vice of covetousness. 

So, a man of an exceeding corrupt and wicked heart, 
who has no love to God and Jesus Christ, but on the 
contrary, being very profanely and carnally inclined, has 
the greatest distaste of the things of religion, and enmity 
against them ; yet being of a family that, from one genera- 
tion to another, have most of them died in youth, of an 
hereditary consumption ; and so having little hope of liv- 



844 WHAT WILLINGNESS AND ' PART III. 

iDg long, and having been instructed in the necessity of a 
supreme love to Christ, and gratitude for his deatii and 
sufferings, in order to his salvation fmm eternal misery ; 
if under these circumstances, he should, through fear of 
eternal tonnents, wish he had such a disposition, but his 
profane and carnal heart remaining, he continues still in 
his habitual distaste q/*, and enmity tOy God and religion, 
and wholly without any exercise of that love and grati* 
tude, (as doubtless the very devils themselves, notwith* 
standing all the devil tshness of their temper, would wish 
for a holy heart, if by that means they could get out of 
hell) : in this case, there is no sincere willingness to love 
Christ, and choose him as his chief good : these holy dis- 
positions and exercises arc not at all the direct object of 
the will ; they truly share no part of the inclination or de- 
sire of the soul ; but all is terminated on deliverance from 
torment : and these graces and pious volitions, notwith- 
standing this forced consent, are looked upon undesirable ; 
as when a sick man desires a dose he greatly abhors, to 
save his life. From these things it appears : 

3. That this indirect willingness, which has been spo- 
ken of, is not that exercise of the will which the command 
requires, but is entirely a different one ; being a volition 
of a different nature, and terminated altogether on di&r- 
ent objects ; wholly falling short of that virtue of will 
whici) the command has respect to, 

4, This other volition, which has only some indirect 
concern with the duty required, cannot excuse for the 
want of that good will itself which is commanded ; being 
not the thing which answers and fulfils the command, and 
being wholly destitute of the virtue whicb the command 
seeks. 



SECT. V. SINC£HITT IS NO EXCUSE. 345 

Further to illustrate this matter. If a child has a most 
excellent father, that has ever treated him with fatherly 
kindness and tenderness, and has every way, in the high- 
est degree, merited his love and dutiful regard, being with* 
ti very wealthy ; but the son is of so vile a disposition^ 
that he inveterately hates his father, and yet, apprehend* 
iog that bis hatred of him is like to prove his ruin, by 
bringing him 6nally to poverty and abject circumstances, 
through his father's disinheriting him, or otherwise — which 
is exceeding cross to his avarice and ambition — he there- 
fore wishes it were otherwise ; but yet remaining under 
the invincible power of his vile and malignant disposition, 
he continues still in his settled hatred of his father. Now, 
if .such a son's indirect willingness to have love and honor 
towards his father, at all acquits or excuses before God, for 
his failing of actually exercising these dispositions towards 
him, which God requires, it must be on one of these ac* 
counts. (1) Either that it answers and fulfils the com* 
mand. But this it does not, by the supposition ; \)ecause 
the thing commanded is love and honor to his worthy pa- 
rent. If the command be proper and just, as is supposed, 
then it obliges to the thing commanded ; and so nothing 
ebe but that can answer the obligation. Or, (2) It must 
be at least, because there is that virtue or goodness in his 
indirect willingness that is equivalent to the virtue required ; 
and so balances or countervails it, and makes up for the 
want of it. But that also id contrary to tiie supposition. 
The willingness the son has merely from a regard to money 
and honor, has no goodness in it to countervail the want 
of the pious Glial respect required. 

Sincerity and reality, in that indirect willingness wfaioh 
bas been spoken of, does not make it the better. Time

which is real and hearty is often called sincere ; whether 
it be in virtue or vice. Some persons are sincerely bad ; 
others are sincerely good ; and others may be sincere and 
hearty in things which are in their own nature indifftr^ 
eni ; as a man may be sincerely desirous of eating when 
he is hungry. But a being sincere, hearty, and in good 
earnest, is no virtue, unless it be in a thing that is virtuous. 
A man m^y be sincere and hearty in joining a crew of pi- 
rates or a gang of robbers. When the devils cried out, 
and besought Christ not to torment them, it was no mere 
pretence ; they were very hearty in their desires not to be 
tormented ; but this did not make their will or desires vir- 
tuous. And if men have sincere desires, which are in 
their kind and nature no better, it can be no excuse for 
the want of any required virtue. 

And as a man's being sincere in such an indirect desire 
or willingness to do his duty as has been mentioned, can* 
not excuse for the want of performance, so it is with tn^ 
deavors arising from such a willingness. The endeavors 
can have no more goodness in them than the will which 
they are the effect and expression of. And, therefore, 
however sincere and real, and however great a person's 
endeavors are, yea, though they should be to the utmost 
of his abilily, unless the will which ihey proceed from 
be truly good and virtuous, they can be of no avail, influ- 
ence, or weight, to any purpose whatsoever, in a moral 
sense or respect. That which is not truly virtuous in 
God's sight, is looked upon by him as good for nothing; 
and so can be of no value, weight, or influence in his ac- 
count, to recommend, satisfy, excuse, or make up for any 
moral defect. For nothing can counterbalance evil but 
good. If evil be in one scale, and we put a great deal 



r' 



secf . V. ts Ko Exc0s£. 247 

into the other, sincere and earnest desires, and many and 
great endeavors ; yet, if there be no real goodness in all, 
there is no weight in it ; and so it does nothing towards 
balancing the real weight which is in the opposite scale. 
It is only like the subtracting a thousand noughts from be- 
fore a real number, which leaves the sum just as it was. 

Indeed, such endeavors may have a negatively good 
influence. Those things which Irave no positive virtue 
have no positive moral influence ^ yet, they may be an 
occasion of persons avoiding some j:>ositive evils. As, if 
a man were in the water with a neighbor that he bad ill- 
will to, who could not swim, holding him by his hand ; 
which neighbor was much in debt to him ; and should be 
tempted to let him sink and drown, but should refuse to 
comply with the temptation, not from love to his neigli- 
bor, but frotn the love of money, and because by bis 
drowning he should lose his debt, that which he does in 
preserving his neiglibor frpm drowning is nothing good in 
the sight of God : yet hereby he avoids the greater guilt 
that would have been contracted if be had designedly let 
his neighbor sink and perish. But when Arminians, in 
their disputes with C^lvinists, insist so much on ^ncere 
desires and endeavors, as what must excuse men, must be 
accepted of God, etc., it is manifest they have respect to 
some positive moral weight or influence of those desires 
and endeavors. Accepting, justifying, or excusing, on 
the account of sincere honest endeavors (as they are call- 
ed), and men's doing what they can, etc., has relation to 
some moral value, something that is accepted as good, 
and, as such, countervailing some defect. 

But there is a great and unknown deceit arising from 
the ambiguity of tbe phrase, sincere endeavors. Indeed, 



848 WHAT SINCERITY OF ENDEAVORS FART IIU 

there is a vast indistinctness and un6xedness in nuKl, or 
at least very many, of the terms used to express things 
pertaining to moral and spiritual matters. Whence arise 
innumerable mistakes, strong prejudices, inextricable con- 
fusion, and endless controversy. 

The word sincere is most commonly used to ngnify 
something that is good : men are habituated to understand 
by it the same as honest and upright ; which terms excite 
an idea of someth'^g good in the strictest and highest sense ; 
good in the sight of Hkn who sees not only the outward ap- 
pearance, but the heart! And, therefore, men think that 
if a pjrson be sincere^ he will certainly be accepted. If it 
be said that any one is sincere in his endeavors, this suggests 
to men's minds as much as that bis heart and >^ ill is good, 
that there is no defect of duty as to virtuous inclination ; 
be honestly and uprightly desires and endeavors to do as 
he is required ^ and this leads them to suppose, that it 
would be very hard and unreasonable to punish him only 
because he is unsuccessful in his endeavors, the thing 
endeavored being beyond bis power. Whereas it ought 
to be observed, that the word sincere has these difierent 
significations : 

1. Sincerity^ as the word is sometimes used, signifies 
no more than reality of wUl and endeavor^ with respect 
to anything lliat is professed or pretended, without any 
consideration of the nature of the principle or aim whence 
this real will and true endeavor arises. If a man baa 
some real desire to obtain a thing, either direct or indirect, 
or does really endeavor after a thing, he is said sincerely 
to desire or endeavor it ; without any consideration of the 
goodness or virtuousness of the principle he acts from, or 
any excellency or worthiness of the end be acts for. 



sifict. v^. ti NO tiLcii^t. 249 

Thus, a mad wha is kind to his neighbor's wife who is 
sick and languishing^ apd very helpful in her case, makes 
a show of desiring and endeavoring her restoration to 
health and vigor ; and not only makes such a show, but 
there is a reality in his pretence — he does heartily and 
earnestly desire to have her health restored, and uses his 
true and utmost endeavors for it ; he is said sincerely to 
desire and endeavor it, because he does so truly or really ; 
though perhaps the principle he acts from is no other 
than a vile and scandalous passion ; having lived in adul* 
tery with her, he earnestly desires to have her health and 
vigor restored, that he may return to his criminal pleas- 
ures with her. Or, 

2. By sincerity is meant, not merely a reality of will 
and endeavor of some sort or other, for some considera- 
tion or other, but a virtuous sincerity. That is, that in 
the performance of those pairticular acts that are the mat- 
ter of virtue or duty, there be not only the matter, but 
the form and essence of virtue, consisting in the aims that 
governs the act, and the principle exercised in it. There 
is not only the reality of the act, that is as it were the 
body of the duty ; but also the soul, which should pro- 
perly belong to such a body. In this sense, a man is 
said to be sincere, when he acts wjth a pure intention ; not 
from sinister views or by-ends : he not only in reality de- 
sires and seeks the thing to be done, or qualification to be 
obtained, for some end or other ; but he wills the thing 
directly and properly, as neither forced nor bribed ; the 
virtue of the thing is properly the object of the will. 

In the former sense, a man is said to be sincere, in op- 
position to a mere pretence and show of the particular 
thing to be done or exhibited, without any real desire or 



950 OF PROMUICS f ART III* 

endeavor at all. In the latter sense, a man is said to be 
sincere, in opposition to that show of virtue there is in 
merely doing the matter of duty, without the reality of 
the virtue itself in the soul, and the essence of it, which 
there is a show of. A man may be sincere in the former 
sense, and yet in the latter, be in the sight of God, who 
searches the heart, a vile hypocrite. 

In the latter kind of sincerity, only, is there anything 
truly valuable or acceptable in the sight of God. And 
this is the thing which in Scripture is called sincerity^ up- 
Tightness, integrity, truth in the inward parts, and a being 
of a perfect heart. And if there be such a sincerity, and 
such a degree of it as there ought to be, and there be any 
thing further that the man is not able to perform, or which 
does not prove to be connected with his sincere desires 
and endeavors, the man is wholly excused and acquitted 
in the sight of God ; his will shall surely be accepted for 
his deed : and such a sincere will and endeavor is all that 

MP 

in strictness is required of him by any command of God. 
But as to the other kind of sincerity of desires and en* 
deavors, it, having no virtue in it, (as was observed be- 
fore), can be of no avail before God, in any case, to 
recommend, satisfy, or excuse, and has no positive moral 
weight or influence whatsoever. 

Corol. 1. Hence it may be inferred, that nothing in the 
reason and nature of things appears from the considera* 
tion of any moral weight of that former kind of sincerity, 
which has been spoken of, at all obliging us to believe, or 
leading us to suppose, that God has made any positive 
promises of salvation, or grace, or any saving assistance, 
or any spiritual benefit whatsoever, to any desires, pray- 
ers, endeaVors, striving, or obedience of those who hither- 



SECT. y. TO GRACELESS £K1>EAV0US. dSl 

to have no true virtue or holiness in their hearts ; though 
we sliould suppose all the sincerity, and the utmost degree 
of endeavor, that is possible to be in a pei*son with- 
out holiness. 

Some object against God's requiring, as the condition 
of salvation, those holy exercises which are the result of 
a supernatural renovation : such as, a supreme respect to 
Christ, love to God, loving holiness for its own sake, etc, ; 
that these inward dispositions and exercises are above 
men's* power, as they are by nature ; and therefore that 
we may conclude, that when men are brought to be sin- 
cere in their endeavors, and do as well as they can, they 
are accepted ; and that this must be all that God requires 
in order to men's being received as the objects of his fa- 
vor, and must be what God has appointed as the condi- 
tion of salvation : concerning which I would observe, that 
in such a nianner of speaking of men^s being accepted be- 
came they are sincere, and do as well as they can, there 
is evidently a supposition of some virtue, some degree of 
that which is truly good, though it does not go so far as 
were to be wished. For if men do what they can, unless 
their so doing be from some good principle, disposition, or 
exercise of heart, some virtuous inclination or act of the will, 
their so doing what they can, is -in some respects not a whit 
better than if they did nothing at all. In such a case, 
there is no more positive moral goodness in a man's doing 
what he can, than in the wind-mill's doing what it can ; 
because the action does no more proceed from virtue ; 
and there is nothing in such sincerity of endeavor, or do- 
ing what we can, that should render it any more a proper 
or fit recommendation to positive favor and acceptance, or 
the condition of any reward or actual benefit, than doing 



352 INBlFFEftKNCfi INCONSISTENT t»ART lit. 

* 

nothing ; for both the one and the other are alike notbingi 
as to any true moral weight or value. 

Corol. 2. Hence also it followS) there is nothing that 
appears in the reason and nature of things which can just- 
ly lead us to determine, that God will certainly give the 
necessary means of salvation, or some way or otiier be- 
stow true holiness and eternal life on tliose heathen who 
are sincere (in the sense above explained) in their endea-

LIBERTY OF INDIFFERENCE NOT ONLY NOT NECESSARY TO 
VIRTUE, BUT UTTERLY INCONSISTENT WITH IT ; AND ALL 
EITHER VIRTUOUS OR VICIOUS HABITS OR INCLINATIONS IN- 
CONSISTENT WITU ARMINIAN NOTIONS OF LIBERTY AND 
MORAL AGENCY. 

To suppose such a freedom of will as Arminians talk 
of, to be requisite to virtue and vice, is many ways con- 
trary to common sense. 

If indifference belongs to liberty of will, as Arminians 
suppose, and it be essential to a virtuous action that it be 
performed in a state of liberty, as they also suppose, it 
will follow, that it is essential to a virtuous action that it 
be performed in a state of indifference : and if it be per- 
formed in a state of indifference, then doubtless it must be 
performed in the time of indifference. And so it will fol- 
low, that in order to the virtuousness of an act, the heart 
must be indifferent in the time of the performance of that 



%tClf* TI. WITH VIRTUE. 3S3 

act» and the more iodifferent and cold the heart is with 
relation to the act which is performed^ so much the bet- 
ter ; because the act is performed with so much the great- 
er liberty. But is this agreeable to the light of nature? 
ts it agreeable to the notions which mankind, in all ages, 
have of virtue ; that it lies in that which is contrary to in- 
difference, even in the tendency and inclination of the 
heart to virtuous action ; and that the stronger the incli- 
nation, and so the further from indifference, the more vir- 
tuous the heart, and so much the more praiseworthy the 
act which proceeds from it? 

' If we should suppose (contrary to what has been be- 
fore demonstrated) that there may be an act of will in a 
state of indifference ; for instance, this act, viz. the will's 
determining to put itself out of a state of indifference, and 
give itself a pre pon deration one way ; then it would fol- 
low, on Anninian principles, that this act or determina- 
tion of the will is that alone wherein virtue consists, be- 
cause this only is performed, while the mind remains in a 
stale of indifference, and so in a state'of liberty ; for when 
once the mind is put out of its equilibrium, it is no longer 
in such a state ; and therefore all the acts which follow 
afterwards, proceeding from bias, can have the nature nei- 
ther of virtue nor vice. Or if the thing which the ^11! 
can do, while yet in a state of indifference, and so of lib- 
erty, be only to suspend acting, and determine to take the 
matter into consideration, then this determination is that 
alone wherein virtue consists, and not proceeding to action 
after the scale rs turned by consideration. So that it will 
follov/, from these principles, all that is done after the 
mind, by any means, is once out of its equilibrium, and 
already possessed bjF an inclination, and arising from that 

22 



254 INDIFFERENCe INCONSISTENT PART III. 

inclination, lias nothing of the nature of virtue or vice, and 
is worthy of neither blame nor praise. But how plainly 
contrary is this to the universal sense of mankind, and to 
the notion they have of sincerely virtuous actions? which 
is, that they are actions which proceed from a heart wett 
disposed and inclined ; and the stronger and the more 
fixed and determined the good disposition of the heart, 
the greater the sincerity of virtue, and so the more of the 
truth* and reality of it. But if there be any acts which 
are done in a state of equilibrium, or spring immediately 
from perfect indifference and coldness of heart, they can- 
hot arise from any good principle or disposition in the 
heart; and consequently, according to common sense, 
have no sincere goodness in them, having no virtue of 
heart in them. To have a virtuous heart, is to have a 
heart that favors virtue, and is friendly to it, and not ohe 
perfectly cold and indifferent about it. 

And besides, the actions that are done in a state of in- 
difference, or that arise immediately out of such a state, 
cannot be virtuous, because, by the supposition, they are 
not determined by any preceding choice. For if there 
be preceding choice, then choice intervenes between the 
act and the state of indifference ; which is contrary to the 
supposition of the act's arising immediately out of indiffer- 
ence. But those acts which are not determined by pre- 
ceding choice, cannot be virtuous or vicious, by Arminian 
principles, because they are not determined by the wHl. 
So tliat neither one way nor the other can any actions be 
virtuous or vicious, according to Arminian principles. If 
the action he determined by a preceding act of choice, it 
cannot be virtuous : because the action is not done in a 
state of indifference, nor does immediately arise from such 






SECT. VI. WITH VIRTUE, 255 

a state ; and so is not done in a $tate of liberty. If the 
action be not determined by a preceding act of choice, 
then it caixnot be virtuous ; because then the will is not 
self-determined in it. So that it is made certain, that 
neither virtue nor vice can ever find any place in the uni- 
verse. 

Moreover, that it is necessary to a virtuous action that 
it be performed in a state of indifference, under a notion 
of that being a state of hberty, is contrary to common sense ; 
as it is a dictate x>f common sense, that indifference itself, 
in many cases, is vicious, and so to a high degree. As, if 
when I see my neighbor or near friend, and one who has 
in the highest degree merited of me, in extreme distress 
and ready to perish, I find an indifference in my heart 
with respect to anything proposed to be done, which I 
can easily do, for his relief. So, if it should be proposed 
to me to blaspheme God, or kill my father, or do num- 
berless other things which might be mentioned, the being 
indifferent, for a moment, would be highly vicious and 
vile. 

And it may be further observed, that to suppose this 
liberty of indifference is essential to virtue and vice, de- 
stroys the great difference of degrees of the guilt of differ- 
ent crimes, and takes away the heinousness of the most 
flagitious, horrid iniquities ; such as adultery, bestiality, 
murder, perjury, blasphemy, etc. For, according to these 
principles there is no harm at all in having the mind in a 
state of perfect indifference with respect to these crimes ; 
nay, it is absolutely necessary in order to any virtue in 
avoiding them, or vice in doing them. But for the mind 
to be in a state of indifference with respect to them, is to 
be next door to doing them ; it is then infinitely near to 



256 or viRTUoiTs 



PART III. 



choosing, and so commilting the fact : for equilibrium is 
the next step to a degree of preponderation ; and one, 
even the least degree of preponderation (all things consid- 
ered) is choice. And not only so, but for the will to be 
in a state of perfect equilibrium with respect to such 
crimes, is for the mind to be in such a state as to be full 
as likely to choose them as to refuse them, to do them as 
to omit tliem. And if our minds must be in such a state, 
wherein it is as near to choosing as refusing, and wherein 
it must of necessity, according to the nature of things, be 
as likely to commit them as to refrain from them, where is 
the exceeding heinousness of choosing and committing 
them ? If there be no harm in often being in such a state 
wherein the probability of doing and forbearing are exactly 
equal, there being an equilibrium, and no more tendency 
to one than the other, then, according to the nature and 
laws of such a contingence, it may be expected, as an 
inevitable consequence of such a disposition of things, 
that we should choose them as often as reject them : that 
it should generally so fall out, is necessary, as equality in 
the effect is the natural consequence of the equal tendency 
of the cause, or of the antecedent state of things from 
which the effect arises. Why then should we be so exceed- 
ingly to blame if it does so fall out ? 

It is many ways apparent, that the Arminian scheme 
of liberty is utterly inconsistent with the being of any 
such things as either virtuous or vicious habits or disposi- 
tions. If liberty of indifference be essential to moral 
agency, then there can be no virtue in any habitual incli-^ 
nations of the heart ; which are contrary to indifference, 
and imply in their nature the very destruction and exclu^ 
9ioD of it. They suppose nothing can be virtuous in which 



SECT. YI. AND VICIOUS HABITS. 257 

no liberty is exercised ; but how absurd is it to talk of 
exercising indifference under bias and preponderation ! 

And if self-determining power in the will be necessary 
to moral agency, praise, blame^ etc., then nothing done 
by the will can be any further praise or blameworthy, 
than so far as the will is moved, swayed, and determined 
by itself, and the scales turned by the sovereign power 
the will has over itself. And therefore the will must not 
be put out of its balance already, the preponderation must 
not be determined and effected before-hand ; and so the 
self-determining act anticipated. Thus it appears another 
way, that habitual bias is inconsistent with that liberty 
which Arminians suppose to be necessary to virtue or 
vice ; and so it follows, that habitual bias Itself cannot be 
either virtuous or vicious. 

The same thing follows from their doctrine concerning 
the inconsistence of necessity with liberty, praise, dis- 
praise, etc. None will deny, that bias and inclination 
may be so strong as to be invincible, and leave no possi- 
bility of the will's determining contrary to it ; and so be 
attended with necessity. This Dr. Whitby allows con- 
cerning the will of God, angels, and glorified saints, with 
respect to good ; and the will of devils, with respect to 
evW, Therefore, if necessity be inconsistent with liberty ; 
then, when fixed inclination is to such a degree of strength, 
it utterly excludes all virtue, vice^ praise, or blame. And 
if so, then the nearer habits are to this strength, the 
more do they impede liberty, and so diminish praise and 
blame. If very strong habits destroy liberty, the lesser 
ones proportionably hinder it, according to their degree 
of strength. And therefore it will follow, that then is the 
act most virtuous or vicious when performed without any 

22* 



258 orviRTdods tAmtnu 

inclination or habitual bias at all, because it is then per* 
formed with most liberty. 

Every prepossessing fixed bias on the mind brings a 
degree of moral inability for the contrary ; because, so far 
as tlio mind is biassed and prepossessed, so much hinder* 
ance is there of the contrary. And therefore if moral in* 
ability be inconsistent with moral agency, or the nature of 
virtue and vice, then, so far as there is any such thing at 
evil disposition of heart, or habitual depravity of inclina- 
tion, whether covetousness, pride, malice, cruelty, or 
whatever else, so much the more excusable persons are, 
so much the less have their evil acts of this kind the na* 
ture of vice. And, on the contrary, whatever excellent 
dispositions and inclinations they have, so much are they 
the less virtuous. 

It is evident, that no habitual disposition of heart, 
whether it be to a greater or less degree, can be in. any 
degree virtuous or vicious ; or the actions which proceed 
from them at all praise or blameworthy. Because, though 
we should suppose the habit not to be of such strength as 
wholly to take aw?iy all moral ability and self-determining 
power ; or hinder but that, although the act be partly from 
bias, yet it may be in part from self-determination ; yet in 
this case, all that is from antecedent bias must be set 
aside, as of no consideration ; and in estimating the de- 
gree of virtue or vice, no more must be considered than 
what arises from self-determining power, without any in- 
fluence of that bias, because liberty is exercised in no 
more ; so that all that is the exercise of habitual inclina* 
tion, is thrown away, as not belonginc; to the morality of 
the action. By which it appears, that no exercise of tfaeso 



8CCT. VI. AND yiCIODS HABITS. 259 

habits, let them be stronger or weaker, can ever hare any 
thing of the nature of either virtue or vice. 

Here if any one should say, that notwithstanding al| 
tliese things, there may be the nature of virtue and vice 
in the habits of the mind, because these habits may 
be the effects of those acts wherein the mind exer* 
cised liberty ; that however the fore*jmentioned rea* 
sons will prove that no habits which are natural, 
or that are born or created With us, cain be either 
virtuous or vicious: yet they will not prove this of ha- 
bits which have been acquired and established by re- 
peated free acts. 

To such an objector I would say, that this evasion will 
not at all help the matter. For if freedom of will be es- 
sentia] to the very nature of virtue and vice, then there is 
no virtue or vice but only in that very thing wherein this 
liberty is exercised. If a man in one or more things 
that he does, exercises liberty, and then by those acts is 
brought into such circumstances, that his liberty ceases, 
and there follows a long series of acts or events that come 
to pass necessarily ; those consequent acts are not virtu- 
ous or vicious, rewardable or punishable ; but only the 
free acts that established this necessity ; for in them alone 
was the man free. The following effects, that are neces- 
sary, have no more of the nature of virtue or vice, than 
health or sickness of body have properly the nature of vir- 
tue or vice, beiflg the effects of a course of free acts of tem- 
perance or intemperance ; or than the good qualities of a 
clock are of the nature of virtue, which are the effects of 
free acts of the artiGcer ; or the goodness and sweetness 
of the fruits of a garden are moral virtues, being the et 
fects of the free and faithful acts of the gardener. If lib- 



360 ARM1NIANI9M INCONSISTENT PART UK 

erty be absolutely reqaisite to the morality of actions, aiui 
necessity wholly inconsistent with it, as Arminians greatly 
insist ; then no necessary effects whatsoever, let the cause 
be never so good or bad, can be virtuous or vicious ; but 
the virtue or vice must be only in theyre« cause^ Agree-* 
ably to this Dr. Whitby supposes the necessity that at-* 
tends the good and evil habits of the saints in heaven, and 
damned in hell, which are the consequence of their free 
acts in their state of probation, are not rewardable or pun-* 
ishable. 

On the whole, it appears, that if the notions of Armin- 
ians concerning liberty and moral agency be true, it will 
follow, that there is no virtue in any such habits or quali- 
ties as humility, meekness, patience, mercy, gratitudci 
generosity, heavenly-nrindedness ; nothing at all praise- 
worthy in loving Christ above father and mother, wife and 
children, or our own lives ; or in delight in holiness, bun- ^ 

gering and thirsting .after righteousness, love to enemies, 
universal benevolence to mankind ; and, on the other hand, 
there is nothing at all vicious, or worthy of dispraise, in 
the most sordid, beastly, malignant, devilish dispositions ; ^ 
in being ungrateful, profane, habitually hating God and 
things sacred and holy ; or in being most treacherous, en- 
vious, and cruel towards men. For all these things are 
dispositions and inclinations of the heart. And, in short, 
there is do such thing as any virtuous or vicious quality q 
mind ; no such thing as inherent virtue and holiness, or 
vice and sin : and the stronger those habits or dispositions 
are, which used to be called virtuous and vicious, the fur^ 
ther they are frotn being so indeed ; the more violent 
men's lusts are, the more fixed their pride, envy, ingrati- 
tud€|, and maliciousness, still the further are they from be-

ing blameworthy. If there be a man that by his own re- 
peated acts, or by any other means, is come to be of the 
most hellish disposition, desperately inclined to treat bis 
neighbors with injuriousness, contempt, and malignity ; 
the further they should be from any disposition to be an- 
gry with him, or in the least to blame him. So, on the 
other hand, if there be a person, who is of a most excel- 
lent spirit, strongly inclining him to th^ most amiable ac- 
tions, admirably meek, benevolent, etc., so much is be fur- 
ther from anything rewardable or commendable. On 
which principles, the man Jesus Christ was very far from 
being praiseworthy for those acts of holiness and kindness 
which he performed, these propensities being strong in 
his. heart. And, above all, the infinitely holy and gra- 
cious God is infinitely remote from anything commenda- 
ble, his good inclinations being infinitely strong, and be, 
therefore, at the utn)ost possible distance from being at 
liberty. And in all cases, the stronger the inclinations of 
any are to virtue, and the more they love it, the less vir- 
tuous they are : and the more they love wickedtiess, the 
less vicious. — ^Whether these things are agreeable to scrip- 
ture, let every Christian, and every man who has read 
the Bible, judge : and whether they are agreeable to 
common sense, let every one judge that has human under- 
standing in exercise. 

And, if we pursue these principles, we shall find that 
virtue and vice are wholly excluded out of the world ; 
and that there never was, nor ever can be, any such thing 
as one or the other, either in God, angels, or men. No 
propensity, disposition, or habit, can be virtuous or vicious, 
as has been shown ; because, they, so far as they take 
place, destroy the freedom of the will, the foundation of 



d62 ARKINIANISK tKCONSlSTENT, ETC* PART III. 

all moral agency, and exclude all capacity of either virtue 
or vice.— And if habits and dispositions themselves be not 
virtuous nor vicious, neither can the exercise of these dis* 
positions be so ; for the exercise of bias is not the exercise 
of free self-determining will^ and so there is no exercise 
of liberty in it. Consequently, no man is virtuous or vi- 
cious, either in being well or ill*disposed, nor in acting 
from a good or bad disposition. And whether this bias 
or disposition be habitual or not, if it exists but a moment 
before the act of will, which is the effect of it, it alters 
not the case, as to the necessity of the effect. Or if there 
be no previous disposition at all, either habitual or occa- 
sional, that determines the act, then it is not choice that 
determines it : it is therefore a contingence, that happens 
to the man, arising from nothing in him ; and is necessary, 
as to any inclination or choice of his;, and, therefore, can- 
not make him either the better or worse, any more than 
a tree is better than other trees, because it oftener hap« 
pens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale: or a rock 
more, vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have 
happened oftener to crawl over it. So that there is no vir- 
tue nor vice in good or bad dispositions, either fixed or tran- 
sient ; nor any virtue or vice ^n acting from any good or 
bad previous inclination ; nor yet any virtue or vice, in 
acting wholly without any previous inclinatroo. Where, 
then; shall we find room for virtue or vice ? 



SKCT, VII. MOTIVE AND INDlTCEtfSVTT, ETC. 76S 



SECTION vir. 

ARMINIAN NOTIONS OF MORAL AGBNOY INCONSISTENT WITH 
ALL INFLUENCE OF MOTIVE AND INDUCEMENT, IN EITHER 
VIRTUOUS OR VICIOUS ACTIONS. 

As Arminian notions of that liberty, which is essential 
to virtue or vice, are inconsistent with common sense, in 
their being inconsistent with all virtuous or vicious habits 
and dispositions ; so they are no less so in their inconsis- 
tency with all influence of motives in moral actions. 

It is equally against those notions of liberty of will 
whether there be, previous to the act of choice, a prepon- 
derancy of the inclination, or a preponderancy of those 
circumstances which have a tendency to move the incli- 
nation. And, indeed, it comes to just the same thing: 
to say, the circumstances of the mind are such as tend to 
sway and turn its inclination one way, is the same thing 
as to say, the inclination of the mind, as, under such cir- 
cumstances, tends that way. 

Or if any think it most proper to say, that motives do 
alter the inclination, and give a new bias to the mind, it 
will not alter the case, as to the present argument. For 
if motives operate by giving the mind an inclination, then 
they operate by destroying the mind's indifference, and 
laying it under a bias. But to do this, is to destroy the 
Arminian freedom : it is not to leave the will to its own 
self-determination, but to bring it into subjection to the 
power of something extrinsic, which operates upon it, 
sways and determines it, previous to its own determina- 
tion. So that what is done from motive, cannot be either 



5S64 ' MOTITE IltCOKSlSTENT PART lit* 

virtuous or vicious.-^And besides^ if the acts of the will 
are excited by motives, those motives are the cause$ of 
those acts of the will ; which makes the acts of the will 
necessary ; as effects necessarily follow the efficiency of 
the cause. And if the influence and power of the motive 
causes the volition, then the influence of the motive deter- 
mines volition, and volition does not determine itself; and 
-so is not free, in the sense of Arminiaus (as has been largely 
shown already) and consequently can be neither viiluous 
nor vicious. 

The supposition, which has already been taken notice 
of, as an insufficient evasion in other cases, would be, in 
like manner, impertinently alleged in this case ; namely, 
the supposition that liberty consists in a power of suspen- 
ding action for the present, in order to deliberation. If it 
should be said, though it be true that the will is under a 
necessity of finally following the strongest motive, yet it 
may, for the present, forbear to act upon the motive pre- 
sented, till tberejias been opportunity thoroughly to con- 
sider it, and compare its real weight with the merit of 
other motives : I answer as follows : 

Here, again, it must be remembered, that if determin- 
ing thus to suspend and consider, be that act of the will, 
wherein alone liberty is exercised, then inr this all virtue 
and vice must coi>^ist ; and the acts that follow this consid- 
eration, and are the effects of it, being necessary, are no 
more virtuous or vicious tlran some good or bad events, 
which happen when they are fast asleep, and are the con- 
sequences of what they did when they were awake. 
Therefore, I would here observe two things : 

1. To suppose that all virtue and vice, in every case, 
consists in determining, whether to take time for consid«> 



SECT. VII. WITH ARMINIAN VIBTUE AND VICE. 265 

eration or not, is not agreeable to comnnon sense. For, 
according to such a supposition, the most horrid crimes^ 
adultery, murder, sodomy, blasphemy, etc. do not at all 
consist in the horrid nature of the things themselves, but only 
to the neglect of thorough consideration before they were 
perpetrated, which brings their viciousness to a small mat- 
ter, and makes all crimes equal. If it be sard, that neglect 
of consideration, when such heinous evils are proposed to 
choice, is worse than in other cases : I answer, this is in- 
consistent, as it supposes the very thing to be, which, at 
the same time, is supposed not to be ; it supposes all moral 
evil, all viciousness and heinousness, does not consist 
merely in the want of consideration. It supposes some 
crimes in themselves, in their own nature, to be more hein- 
ous than others antecedent to consideration or inconsidera- 
tion, which lays the person under a previous obligation to 
consider in some cases more than others. 

2. If it were so, that all virtue and vice, in every case, 
consisted only in the act of the will, whereby it determines 
whether to consider or no, it would not alter the case in 
the least, as to the present argument. For still in this 
act of the will on this determination, it is induced by some 
motive, and necessarily follows the strongest motive ; and 
so is necessarily, even in that act wherein alone it is either 
virtuous or vicious. • 

One thing more I would observe, concerning the incon- 
sistence of Arminian notions of moral agency with the in- 
fluence of motives. — I suppose none will deny, that it is 
possible for motives to be set before the mind so powerful, 
and exhibited in so strong a light, and under so advanta- 
geous circumstances, as to be invincible ; and such as the 
mind cannot but yield to. In this case, Arminians will 

23 



n 
I 



966 MOTITC AND INDUCEMENT, ETC. PART III. 

doubtless say, liberty is destroyed. And if so, then if 
motives are exhibited with half so much power, they hin- 
der liberty in proportion to their strength, and go half-way 
towards destroying it. If a thousand degrees of motive 
abolish all liberty, then five xhundred take it half away. If 
one degree of the influence of motive does not at all in- 
fringe or diminish liberty, then no more do two degrees ; 
for nothing doubled, is still nothing. And if two degrees 
do not diminish the will's liberty, no more do four, eight, 
sixteen, or six thousand. For nothing multiplied never 
so much comes to but nothing. If there be nothing in 
the nature of motive or moral suasion that is at all oppo- 
site to liberty, then the greatest degree of it cannot hurt 
liberty. But if there be anything in the nature of the 
thing that is against liberty, then the least degree of it 
hurts it in some degree, and consequently hurts and di- 
minishes virtue. If invincible motives to that action which 
is good, take away all the freedom of the act, and so all 
the virtue of it ; then the more forcible the motives are, 
so much the worse, so much the less virtue ; and the 
weaker the motives are, the better for the cause of virtue ; 
and none is best of all. 

Now let it be considered, whether these things are 
agreeable to common sense. If it should be allowed, that 
there are some instances wherein the soul chooses with- 
out any motive, what virtue can there be in such a choice ? 
I am sure there is no prudence or wisdom in it. Such a 
choice is made for no good end ; for it is for no end at all. 
If it were for any end, the view of the end would be the 
motive exciting to the act ; and if the act be for no good 
end, and so from no good aim, then there is no good in- 
t.ention in it : and^ therefore, according to all our natural 



SECT. Vlt. ARMINIAN ARGUMENT, ETC. 967 

notions of virtue, no more virtue in it than in the motion 
of the smoke, which is driven to and fro by the wind, 
without any aim or end in the thing moved, and which 
knows not whither, nor why and wherefore, it is moved.' 
Corol. ] . By these things it appears, that the argu- 
ment against the Calvinists, taken from the use of coun- 
sels, exhortations, invitations, expostulations, etc. so much 
insisted on by Arminians, is truly against themselves. For 
these things can operate no other way to any good effect, 
than as in them is exhibited motive and inducement, ten- 
ding to excite and determine the acts of the will. But it 
follows, on their principles, that the acts of will excited 
by such causes, cannot be virtuous ; because, so far as 
tliey are from these, they are not from the will's self-deter- 
mining power. Hence it will follow, that it is not worth 
the while to offer any arguments to persuade men to any 
virtuous volition or voluntary action ; it is in vain to set 
before them the wisdom and amiableness of ways of virtue, 
or the odiousness and folly of ways of vice. This notion 
of liberty and moral agency frustrates all endeavors to 
draw men to virtue by instruction or persuasion, precept 
or example : for though these things may induce men to 
what is materially virtuous, yet at the same time they 
take away the ybrm of virtue, because they destroy liberty ; 
as they, by their owjd power, put the will out of its equi- 
librium, determine and turn the scale, and take the woik 
of self-determining power out of its hands. And the 
clearer the instructions that are given, the more powerful 
the arguments that are used, and the more moving the 
persuasions or examples, the more likely they are to frus- 
trate their own design ; because they have so much the 
greater tendency to put the will out of its balance, to bin- 



268 ABMINIAN ARGUMENT, ETC. PART III. 

der its freedom of se]f»determinaiion ; and so to exclude 
the very form of virtue, and the essence of ^^'hatsoever is 
praiseworthy. 

So, it clearly follows, from these principles, that God 
has no hand in any man's virtue, nor does at all promote 
it, either by a physical or moral influence ; that none of 
the moral methods he uses with men to promote virtue 
in the world, have tendency to the attainment of that end ; 
that all the instructions which he has given to men, from 
the beginning of the world to this day, by prophets or 
apostles, or by his Son Jesus Christ ; that all his counsels, 
invitations, promises, threatenings, warnings, and expos* 
tulations ; that all means he has used with men, in ordi* 
nances or providences ; yea, all influences of his Spirit, 
ordinary and extraordinary, have had no tendency at all 
to excite any one virtuous act of the mind, or to promote 
anything morally good and commendable, in any respect. 
— For there is no way that these, or any other means, 
can promote virtue, but one of these three. Either (1) 
by a physical operation on the heart. But all effects that 
are wrought in men in this way, have no virtue in them, 
by the concurring voice of all Arminians. Or, (2) moraily,^ 
by exhibiting motives to the understanding, to excite good 
acts in the will. But it has been demonstrated, that voli- 
tions, which are excited by motives, are necessary, and 
n*t excited by a self- moving power; and therefore, by 
their principles, there is no virtue in them. Or, (3) by 
merely giving the will an opportunity to determine itself 
concerning the objects proposed, either to choose or re- 
ject, by its own uncaused, unmoved, uninfluenced self-de- 
termination. And if this be all, then all those means do 
no more to piX)mote virtue than vice : for they do nothing 



SECT. VII, AGAINST THEMSELVES. 269 

but give the will opportunity to determine itself either 
wayy either to good or bad, without laying it under any 
bias to either : and so there is really as much of anoppor^ 
tunity given to determine in favor of evil as of good. 

Thus, that horrid blasphemous consequence will cer- 
tainly follow from the Arminian doctrine which they 
charge on others ; namely, that God acts an inconsistent 
part in using so many counsels, warnings, invitations, en- 
treaties, etc. with sinners, to induce them to forsake stn^ 
and turn to the ways of virtue ; and that all are insincere 
and fallacious. It will follow, from their doctrine, that 
God does these things when he knows, at tlie same time, 
that they liave no manner of tendency to promote the ef-^ 
feet he seems to aim at ; yea, knows that if they have 
any influence, this very influence will be inconsistent with 
such an eflfect, and will prevent it. But what an impu- 
tation of insincerity would this fix on Him who is infinite- 
ly holy and true ! — So that theirs is the doctrine which, 
if pursued in its consequences, does horribly reflect on the 
Most High, and fix on him the charge of hypocrisy ; and 
not the doctrine of the Calvinist ; according to their fre- 
quent and vehement exclamations and invectives. 

Corol. 2. From what has been observed in this section, 
it again appears, that Arminian principles and notions, 
when fairly examined and pursued in their demonstrable 
consequences, do evidently shut all virtue out of the world, 
and make it impossible that there sliould ever be any such 
thing in any case, or that any such thing should ever be 
conceived of. For, by these principles, the very notion 
of virtue or vice implies absurdity and contradiction. For 
it is absurd in itself, and contrary to common sense, to 
suppose a virtuous act of mind without any good intentioiv 

23* 



S70 ARMINIANISM EXCLUDES ALL VIRTUE PART III. 

or aim ; and, by their principles, it is absurd to suppose a 
virtuous act with a good intention or aim ; for to act for 
an end, is to act from a motive. So that if we* rely on 
these principles, there can be no virtuous act with a good 
design and end ; and it is self-evident, there can be none 
without : consequently the^e can be no virtuous act at all. 

Corol. 3. It is manifest, that Arminian notions of moral 
agency, and the being of a faculty of will, cannot consist 
together : and that if there be any such thing as either a 
virtuous or vicious act, it cannot be an act of the will ; no 
will can be at all concerned in it. For that fict which is 
performed without inclination, without motive, without 
end, must be performed without any concern of the wilL 
To suppose an act of the will without these, implies a 
contradiction. If the soul in its act has no motive or end ; 
then, in that act (as was observed before), it seeks noth- 
ing, goes after nothing, exerts no inclination to anything ; 
and this implies, that in that act it desires nothing, and 
chooses nothing; so that there is no act of choice in the 
case: and that is as much as to say, there is no act of will 
in the case. Which very effectually shuts all vicious and 
virtuous acts out of the universe ; inasmuch as, according 
to this, there can be no virtuous or vicious afct wherein 
the will is concerned ; and according to the plainest die* 
tates of reason, and the light of nature, and also the prin- 
ciples of Arminians themselves, there can be no virtuous 
or vicious act wherein the will is not concerned. And 
therefore there is no room for any virtuous or vicious acts 
at all. 

Corol. 4. If none of the moral actions of intelligent be- 
ings are influenced by ehher previous inclination or motive, 
another strange thing will follow ; and this is, that God not 



SECT. ril. AND VICE OUT OF THE WOBLD. S71 

only cannot foreknow any of the future moral actions of 
his creatures, but he can make no conjecture^ can give no 
probable guess, concerning them. For, all conjecture in 
things of this nature, must depend on some discerning or 
apprehension of these two things, previous disposition and 
motive^ which, as has been observed, Arminian notions of 
moral agency, in their real consequence, altogether ex- 
clude. 



PART IV. 

WHEREIN THE CHIEF GROUNDS OF THE REASONINGS OF 
▲RMINIANS, IN SUPPORT AND DEFENCE OF THE FORE- 
MENTIONED NOTIONS OF LIBERTY, MORAL AGENCY, ETC. 
AND AGAINST THE OPPOSITE DOCTRINE, ARE CONSID- 
ERED. 

SECTION I. 

THE ESSENCE OF THE VIRTUE AND VICE OF DISPOSITIONS OF 
THE HEART, AND ACTS OF THE WILL, LIES NOT IN THEIR 
CAUSE, BUT THEIR NATURE* 

One main foundation of the reasons which are brought 
to establish the fore-mentioned notions of liberty, virtue, 
vice, etc., is a supposition, that the virtuousness of the 
dispositions, or acts of the will, consists not in the nature 
of these dispositions or acts, but wholly in the origin or 
cause of them : so that if the disposition of the mind or 
acts of the will be never so good, yet if the cause of the 
disposition or act be not our virtue, there is nothing vir- 
tuous or praiseworthy in it ; and, on the contrary, if the 
will, in its inclination or acts, be never so bad, yet, unless 
it arises from something that is our vice or fault, there is 
nothing vicious or blameworthy in it. Hence their grand 
objection and pretended demonstration, or self-evidence, 
against any virtue and commendableness, or vice and 
blameworthiness, of those habits or acts of the will which 
are not from some virtuous or vicious determination of the 
will itself. 



SECT. 1. f He ESS^NCe OF VIRTUE AKD VICE. ^3 

Now, i,f this matter \^ well considered, it will appear 
to be altogether a mistake, yea, a gross absurdity ; and 
that it is most certain, that if there be any such things as 
a virtuous or vicious disposition, or volition of mind, the 
virtuousness or viciousness of them consists not in the ori* 
gin or cause of these things, but in the nature of them. 

If the essence of virtuousness or commendableness, and 
of viciousness or fault, does not lie in the nature of the 
dispositions or acts of mind, which are said to be our vir- 
tue or our fault, but in their cause, then it is certain it lies 
nowhere at all. Thus, for instance, if the vice of a vicious 
act of will lies not in the nature of the act, but the cause ; 
so that its being of a bad nature will not make it at all our 
fault, unless it arises from some faulty determination of ours, 
as its cause, or something in us that is our fault ; then for 
the same reason, neither can the viciousness of that cause 
lie in the nature of the thing itself, but in its cause : that 
evil determination of ours is not our fault, merely because 
it is of a bad nature, unless it arises from some cause in 
us that is our fault. And when we are come to this 
higher cause, still the reason of the thip^ holds good ; 
though this cause be of a bad nature, yet we are not at 
all to blame on that account, unless it arises from some- 
thing faulty in us. Nor yet can blameworthiness lie in 
the nature of this causey but in the cause of that. And 
thus^ we must drive faultiness back from step to step, from 
a lower cause to a higher, in infinitum ; and that is tho« 
roughly to banish it from the world, and to allow it no 
possibility of existence anywhere in the universality of 
things. On these ^principles, vice, or- moral evil, cannot 
consist in anything that is an effect ; because fault does 
nof consist in the nature of things, but in their cause ] as 



^4 THE ESSENCE OF VIRTUE AND VICE. PABt lV« 

4 

well as because efiects are necessarj, being unavoidably 
connected with tbefr cause : therefore the cause only is 
to blame. And so it follows, that faultiness can lie only 
in thai cause^ which is a catue only and no effect of any-* 
thing. Nor yet can it lie in this ; for then it must lie in 
the nature of the thing itself; not in its being from any de- 
termination of ours, nor anything faulty in us, which is 
the cause, nor indeed from any cause at all ; for, by the 
supposition, it is no effect, and has no cause. And thus, 
he that will maintain it is not the nature of habits or acts 
of will that makes them virtuous or faulty, but the cause, 
must immediately run himself out of his own assertion: 
and, in maintaining it, will insensibly contradict and 
deny it. 

This is certain, that if effects are vicious and faulty, not 
from their nature, or from anything inherent in them, but 
because they are from a bad cause, it must be on account 
of the badness of the cause : a bad effect in the will must 
be bad, because the cause is had^ or of an evil nature y or 
has badness as a quality inherent in it : and a good effect 
in the will must be good by reason of the goodness of the 
cause, or its being of a good kind and nature. And if 
this be what is meant, the very supposition of fault and 
praise lying not in the nature of the thing, but the cause, 
contradicts itself, and does at least resolve the essence of 
virtue and vice into the nature of things, and supposes it 
originally to consist in that. — And if a caviller has a mind 
to run from the absurdity, by saying, " No, the fault of 
the thing, which is the cause, lies not in this, that the 
cause itself is of an evil nature, but that the cause is evil 
in that sense, that it is from another bad cause." Still 
the absurdity will follow him ; for, if so, then the cause 






SECT. I. THE EISSENCE OF YtKTUE AND VICE. S75 

before charged is at once acquitted, apd all the blame 
must be laid to the higher cause, and must consist in that's 
being evil, or of an evil nature. So now we are come 
again to lay the blame of the thing blameworthy, to the 
nature of the thing, and not to the cause. And if any is 
so foolish as to go higher *still, and ascend from step to 
step, till he is come to that which is the first cause con* 
cerned in the whole affair, and will say, all the blame lies 
in that ; then, at last, he must be forced to own, that the 
faultinessof the thing, which he supposes alone blamewor- 
thy, lies wholly in the nature of the thing, and not in the 
original or cause of it ;' for the supposition is, that it has no 
original, it is determined by no act of ours, is caused by 
nothing faulty in us, being absolutely without any came. 
And so the race is at an end, but the evader is taken in 
his flight ! 

It is agreeable to the natural notions of mankind, that 
moral evil, with its desert of dislike and abhorrence, and 
all its other ill-deservings, consists in- a certain deformity 
in the nature of certain dispositions of the heart and acts 
of the will ; and not in the deformity of something else, 
diverse from the very thing itself, which deserves abhor- 
rence, supposed to be the cause of it. Which would be 
absurd, because that would be to suppose a thing, that is 
innocent and not evil, is truly evil and faulty, because an- 
other thing is evil. It implies a contradiction ; for it 
would be to suppose, the very thing which is niorally evil 
and blameworthy, is innocent and not blameworthy ; but 
that something else, which is its cause, is only to blame. 
To say, that vice does not consist in the thing which 
is vicious, but in its cause, is the same as to say, that vice 
does not consist in vice, but in that which produces it. 



S76 THE ESSENCE OF YIRTUE AND VICE, PART IT. 

It is true a cause may be to blame for being the cause 
of vice : it may be wickedness in the cause that it produ- 
ces wickedness. But it would imply a contradiction, to 
suppose that these two are the same individual wicked- 
ness. The wicked act of the cause in producing wicked- 
ness, is one wickedness ; and the wickedness produced, 
if there be any produced, is another. And therefore the 
wickedness of the latter does not lie in the former, but is 
distinct from it ; and the wickedness of both lies in the 
evil nature of the things which are wicked. 

The thing which makes sin hateful, is that by which it 
deserves punishment ; which is but the expression of ha- 
tred. And that which renders virtue lovely, is the same 
with that, on the account of which, it is fit to receive 
praise and reward ; which are but the expressions of es* 
t'lftem and love. But that which makes vice hateful, is its 
hateful nature ; and that which renders virtue lovely, is 
its amiable nature. It is a certain beauty or deformity that 
are inherent in that good or evil will, which is the soul of 
virtue and vice (and not in the occasion of it), which is 
their worthiness of esteem or disesleem, praise or dis- 
praise, according to the common sense of mankind. If 
the cause or occasion of the rise of a hateful disposition or 
act of will, be also hateful, suppose another antece- 
dent evil will ; that is entirely another sin, and deserves 
punishment by itself, under a distinct consideration. 
There is worthiness of dispraise in the nature of an evil 
volition, and not wholly in some foregoing act, which is 
its cause ; otherwise the evil volition, which is the effect, 
is no moral evil, any more than sickness, or some other 
natural calamity, which arises from a cause morally evil. 

Thus, for instance, ingratitude is hateful and worthy of 



SECT. I. IV THE NATURE OF VOLITION, ETC* St77 

dispraise, according to commoo sense ; not because some- 
thing as bad, or worse than ingratitude, was the cause that 
produced it ; but because it is hateful in itself, by its own 
inherent deformity. So, the love of virtue is amiable and 
worthy of praise, not merely because sbmething else went 
before this love of virtue in our minds, which caused it 
to take place there ; for instance, our own choice ; we 
cliose to love virtue, and, by some method or other, 
wrought ourselves into the love of it ; but because of the 
amiableness and condescendency of such a disposition and 
inclination of heart. If that was the case, that we did 
choose to love virtue, and so produced that love in our- 
selves, this choice itself could be no otherwise amiable or 
praiseworthy, then as love to virtue, or some other amia- 
ble inclination, was exercised aad implied in it. If that 
choice was amiable at all, it must be so on account of some 
amiable quality in the nature of the choice. If we chose to 
love virtue, not in love to virtue, or anything that was good, 
and exercised no sort of good disposition in the choice, the 
choice itself was not virtuous nor worthy of any praise, ac- 
cording to common sense, because the choice was not of a 
goad nature. 

It may riot be improper here to take notice of some- 
thing said by an author, that has lately made a mighty 
noise in America. " A necessary holiness (says he *) is 
no holiness. Adam could not be originally created in 
righteousness and true holiness, because he must choose 
to be righteous, before he could be righteous. And 
therefore he must exist, he must be created ; yea, he must 
exercise thought and reflection, before he was righteous." 

* Scrip. Doe. of Original Sin, p. 180, third edit. 

24 



978 THE ESSENCE OF VIRTUE AND TICE, PART IT* 

There is much more to the same efl^ct in that place, and 
also in pp. 437, 438, 439, 440. If these things are 
so, it will certainly follow, that the first choosing to be 
righteous is no righteous choice ; there is no righteousness 
or holiness in it, because no choosing to be righteous goes 
before it. For he plainly speaks of choosing to be 
righteotis, as what must go before righteousness ; and 
that which follows the choice, being the effect of the 
choice, cannot be righteousness or holiness : for an effect 
is a' thing necessary, and cannot prevent the influence 
or efficacy of its cause ; and therefore is unavoidably de- 
pendent upon the cause ; and he says, a necessary holi" 
ness is no holiness. So that neither can a choice of righ- 
teousness be righteousness or holiness, nor can anything 
that is consequent on that choice, and the effect of it, be 
righteousness or holiness ; nor can anything that is with- 
out choice be righteousness or holiness. So that by his 
scheme, all righteousness and holiness is at once shut out 
of the world, and no door left open by which it can ever 
possibly enter into the world. 

I suppose the way that men came to entertain this ab- 
surd inconsistent notion, with respect to internal inclina- 
tions and volitions themselves (or notions that imply it), 
viz. that the essence of their moral good or evil lies not 
in their nature, but their cause ; was, that it is indeed, a 
very plain dictate of common sense, that it is so'with re-^ 
spect to all outward actions, and sensible motions of the 
body : that the moral good or evil of ihem does not lie at 
all in the motions themselves, which, taken by themselves, 
are nothing of a moral nature ; and the essence of all the 
moral good or evil that concerns them, lies in those inter- 
nal dispositions and volitions which are the cau$e of them. 



SftCT. I. IN THE NATDKE OF VOLITION^ ETC. 279 

Now, being always used to deterniine this, without hesi- 
tation or dispute, concerning external actions y which are 
the things that, in the common use of language, are signi- 
6ed by such phrases as men's actions^ or their doings ; 
hence, when they came to speak of volitions, and inter-' 
nal exercises of their inclinations, under the same denomi- 
nation of their actions^ or what they do, they unwarily de- 
termined the case must also be the same with these as 
with external actions; not considering the vast difference 
in the nature of the case. 

If any shall still object and say, why is it not necessary 
that the cause should be considered, in order to determine 
whether anything be worthy of blame or praise ? is it 
agreeable to reason and common sense, that a man is to 
be praised or blamed for that which he is not the cause or 
author of, and has no hand in ? 

I answer : Such phrases as being the cause ^ being the 
author^ having a hand, and the like, are ambiguous. 
They are most vulgarly understood for being the design- 
ing voluntary cause, or cause by antecedent choice ; and 
it is most certain, that men are not, in this sense, the cau- 
ses or authors of the 6rst act of their wills, in any case, as 
certain as anything is or ever can be ; for nothing can be 
more certain than that a thing is not before it is, nor a 
thing of the same kind before the first thing of that kind ; 
and so no choice before the first choice. — As the phrase, 
being the author, may be understood, not of being the 
producer by an antecedent act of. will, but as a person 
may be said to be the author of the act of will itself, by 
his being the immediate agent, or the being that is acting, 
or in exercise in that act : if the phrase of being the au- 
thor is used to signify this, then doubtless common sense 



SI80 AEMIMIAN NOTIOH OF ACTION PART IT. 

requires men's being the authors of their own acts of will, 
in order to their being esteemed worthy of praise or dis- 
praise, on account of tbeiA. And common sense teaches, 
that they must be the authors of external aciionty in the 
former sense, namely, their being the causes of them by 
an act of will or choice, in order to their being justly 
blamed or praised : but it teaches no such thing with re- 
spect to the acts of the will themselves. But this may 
appear more manifest by the things which will be observ- 
ed in the following section. 

SECTION IL 

THE FALSENESS AND INCONSISTENCE OF THAT METAFHTSIGAL 
NOTION OF ACTION AND AGENCY WHICH SEEMS TO BE GEN- 
ERALLY ENTERTAINED BY THE DEFENDERS OF THE ARMINI- 
AN DOCTRINE CONCERNING LIBERTY, MORAL AGENCY » ETC. 

One thing, that is made very much a ground of argu- 
ment and supposed demonstration by Arminians, in de- 
fence of the fore-mentioned principles concerning moral 
agency, virtue, vice, etc., is their metaphysical notion of 
agency and action. They say, unless the soul has a self- 
determining power, it has no power of action, if its voli- 
tions be not caused by itself, but are excited and determined 
by some extrinsic cause, they cannot be the soul's own 
acts ; and that the soul cannot be active, but must be 
wholly passive, in those effects which it is the subject of 
necessarily, and not from its own free determination. 

Mr. Chubb lays the foundation of his scheme of liberty, 
and of his arguments to support it, very much in this po- 
sitipn, that man is an agent, and capable of action. Which 
doubtless is true : but self-determination belongs to his 



.S^ECT. II. FALSE AND INCONSISTfiNT. 281 

notion of action^ and is the very essence of it. Whence 
he infers, that it is impossible for a man to act and be act- 
ed upon, in the same thing, at the same time ; and that 
nothing that is an action, can be the effect of the action 
of another : and he insists, that a necessary agent ^ or 
an agent that is necessarily determined to act, is a plain 
contradiction. 

But those are a precarious sort of demonstrations, which 
men build on the meaning that they arbitrarily affix to a 
word ; especially when that meaning is abstruse, incon- 
sistent, and entirely diverse from the original sense of the 
word in common speech. 

That the meaning of the word action^ as Mr. Chubb* 
and many others use it, is utterly unintelligible and incon- 
sistent, is manifest, because it belongs to their notion of 
an action, that it is sooiething wherein is no passion or 
passiveness ; that is (according to their sense of passive- 
ness) it is under the power, influence, or action of no cause. 
. And this implies, that action has no cause, and is no effect ; 
for to be an effect implies passiveness^ or the being sub- 
ject to the power and action of its cause. And yet they 
hold, that the mind's action is the effect of its own. deter- 
mination ; yea, the mind's free and voluntary determinn- 
tion, which is the same with free choice. So that action 
is the effect of something preceding, even a preceding act 
of choice : and consequently, in this effect, the mind is 
passive, subject to the power and action of the preced- 
ing cause, which is the foregoing choice, and therefore 
cannot be active. So that here we have this contradict 
tion, that action is always theefiect of foregoing. choice, 
and therefore cannot bQ action ; because it i^ passive to 
the power of that preceding causal choice ; and the mind 

24* 



282 THE AXuainiA^ ji&ftoa of ACtiON part it. 

cannot be active and passive in the same thing, at the same 
time. Again, they say, necessity is utterly inconsistent 
with action^ and a necessary action is a contradiction ; 
and so their notion of action implies contingence, and ex- 
cludes all necessity. And, therefore, their notion of ac- 
tion implies, that it has no necessary dependence or con- 
nection with anything foregoing ; for such a dependence 
or connection (Excludes contingence, and implies necessity. 
And yet their notion of action implies necessity, and sup- 
poses that it is necessary, and cannot be contingent. For 
they sgppose, that whatever is properly, called action, 
must be determined by the will and free choice ; and this 
is as much as to say, that it must be necessary, being de- 
pendent upon, and determined by something foregoing, 
namely, a foregoing act of choice. Again, it belongs to 
their notion of action, of that which is a proper and mere 
act, that it is the beginning of motion, or of exertion of 
power ; but yet it is implied in their notion of action, that 
it is not the beginning of motion or exertion of power, but 
is consequent and dependent on a preceding exertion of 
power, viz. the power of will and choice : for they say 
there is no proper action but what is freely chosen, or, 
which is the same thing, determined by* a foregoing act 
of free choice. But if any of them shall see cause to de- 
ny this, and say they hold no such thing, as that every 
action is chosen or determined by a foregoing choice, but 
that the very first exertion of will only, undetermined by 
any preceding act, is properly called action ; then I say, 
such a man's notion of action implies necessity ; for what 
the mind is the subject of, without the determination of its 
own previous choice, it is the subject of necessarily, as to 
any hand that free choice has in the affair, and without 



nCT. II. VIlSS and INCONSlSTCflT. 233 

any ability the mind has to prevent it by any will or elec- 
tion of its own ; because, by the supposition, it precludes 
all previous acts of the will or choice in the case, which 
might prevent it. So that it is again in this Sther way, 
implied in their notion of act, that it is both necessary and 
not necessary. Again, it belongs to their notion of an actj 
that jt is no effect of a predetermining bias or prepondera- 
tion, but springs immediately out of indifference ; and this 
implies, that it cannot be from foregoing choice, which is 
foregoing preponderation : if it be not habitual, but occa- 
sional, yet if it causes the act, it is truly previous, effica- 
cious, and determining. And yet, at the same time, it is 
essential to their notion of the actj that it is what the agent 
IS the author of freely and voluntarily, and that is by pre- 
vious choice and design. 

So that, according to their notion of the act, considered 
with regard to its consequences, these following things 
are all essential to it, viz. That it should be necessary, 
and not necessary ; that it should be from a cause, and no 
cause ; that it should be the fruit of choice and design, 
and not the fruit of choice and design ; that it should be 
the beginning of motion or exertion, and yet consequent 
on previous exertion ; that it should be before it is ; that 
it should spring immediately out of indifference and equi- 
librium, and yet. be the effect of preponderation ; that it 
should be self-originated, and also have its original from 
something else ; that it is what the mind causes itself, of 
its own will, and can produce or prevent, according to its 
choice or pleasure, and yet what the mind has no power 
to prevent, precluding all previous choice in the afiiiir. 

So that an act, according to their metaphysical notion 
of it^ is something of which there is no idea ; it is noth- 



5284 THE ARMINIAN NOTION OF ACTION PABT IV. 

ing but a confusion of the mind, excited by words, with- 
out any distinct meaning, and is an absolute nonentity ; 
and that in two respects. (1) There is nothing in the 
world tbft ever was, is, or can be, to answer the things 
which must belong to its description, according to what 
they suppose to be essential to it. And (2) there nei- 
ther is, nor ever was, nor can be, any notion or idea to 
answer the word, as they use and explain it. For, if 
we should suppose any such notion, it would many ways 
destroy itself. But it is impossible any idea or notion 
should subsist in the mind,- whose Very nature and essence 
* which constitutes it, destroys it. If some learned philoso- 
pher, who had been abroad, in giving an account of the 
curious observations he had made in his travels, should 
say, '' he had been in Terra del Fuego, and there had 
seen an animal, which he calls by a certain name, that 
begat and brought forth itself, and yet bad a sire dam dis- 
tinct from itself; that it had an appetite, and was hungry 
before it had a being ; that his master, who led him, gov- 
erned him at his pleasure, who was always governed by 
him, and driven by him where he pleased ; that when he 
moved, he always took a step before the first step ; that 
he went with his head first, and yet always went tail fore- 
most ; and this, though he had neither head nor tail :" it 
would be no impudence at all to tell such a traveller, 
thou<rh a learned man, that he himself had no notion or 
idea of such an animal as he gave an account of, and never 
had, nor ever would have. 

As the fore-mentioned notion of action is very incon- 
sistent, so it is wholly diverse from the original meaning of 
the word. The more usual signification of it, in vulgar 
speech, seems to be some motion or exertion ofpower^

that is voluntary, or that is the effect of the will^ and is 
used in the same sense as doing ; and most commonly 
it is used to signify outward actions* So thinking is often 
distinguished from actings and desiring and willing from 
doing. 

Besides this more usual and proper signification of the 
word action, there are other ways in which the word is 
used that are less proper, which yet have place in com- 
mon speech. Oftentimes it is used to signify some mo- 
tion or alteration in inanimate things, with relation to some 
object and efEect. So, the spring of a watch is said to 
act upon the chain and wheels; the sunbeams, to act 
upon plants and trees ; and the fire, to act upon wood. 
Sometimes the word is used^to signify motions, alterations, 
and exertions of power, which are seen in corporeal things, 
considered absolutely ; especially when these motions seem 
to arise from some internal cause which is hidden ; so 
that they have a greater resemblance of those motions of 
our bodies, which are the effects of natural volition, or in- 
visible exertions of the will. So, the fermentation of li- 
quor, the operations of the loadstone, and of electrical 
bodies, are called the action of these things. And some- 
times, the word action is used to signify the exercise of 
thought, or of will and inclination : so meditating, loving, 
hating, inclining, disinclining, choosing, and refusing, may 
be sometimes called acting ; though more rarely (unless 
it be by philosophers and metaphysicians) than in any of 
the other senses. 

But the word is never used in vulgar, speech in that 
sense which Arminian divines use it in, namely, for the 
self-determinate exercise of the will, or an exertion of the 



286 THE ARMINIAN NOTION OF ACTION PART IV. 

soul, that arises without any necessaiy conoection with any 
thing foregoing. If a man does something voluntarily, or, 
as the effect of his choice, then, in the most proper sense 
and as the word is most originally and commonly used^ 
be is said to act; but whether that choice or volition be 
self-determined, or no ; whether it be connected with fore- 
going habitual bias ; whether it be the certain effect of 
the strongest motivje, or some intrinsic cause, never comes 
into consideration in the meaning of the word. 

And if the word action is arbitrarily used by some men 
otherwise^ to suit some scheme of metaphysics or morality, 
no argument can reasonably be founded on such a use of 
this term, to prove anything but their own pleasure. For 
divines and philosophers strenuously to urge such argu* 
ments, as though they were sufficient to support and dem- 
onstrate a whole scheiiie of moral philosophy and divinity, 
is certainly to erect a mighty edifice on the sand, or rather 
on a shadow. And though it may now perhaps, through 
custom, have become natural for them to use the word in 
this sense (if that may be called a sense or meaning, 
which is inconsistent with itself), yet this does not prove 
that it is agreeable to the natural notions men have of 
things, or that there can be anything in the creation that 
should answer such a meaning. And though they appeal 
to experience, yet the truth is, that men are so far from 
experiencing any such thing, that it is impossible for them 
to have any conception of it. 

If it should be objected, that action and passion are 
doubtless words of a contrary signification ; but to suppose 
that the agent, in its action, is under the power and influ- 
ence of something intrinsic, is to confound action and pas- 
sion, and make them the same thing-: 



SECT. 11. FALSE AND IKCONSISTENT. 287 

I answer, that action and passion are doubtless, as they 
are sometimes used, words of opposite signilScation ; but 
not as signifying opposite existences, but only opposite re- 
laiions. The words cause and effect are terms of oppo-- 
site signification ; but, nevertheless, if I assert that the 
same thing may at the same time, in different .respects 
and relations, be both cause and effect, this will not prove 
that I confound the terms. The soul may be both active 
and passive in the same thing in different respects ; active 
with relation to one thing, and passive with relation to 
another. The word passion, when set in opposition to 
action, or rather activeness, is merely a relative : it signi- 
fies no effect or cause, nor any proper existence ; but is 
the same with passiveness, or a being passive, or a being 
acted upon by some thing. Which is a mere relation of 
a thing to some power or force exerted by some cause, 
producing some effect in it or upon it. And action, when 
set properly in opposition to passion, or passiveness, is no 
real existence ; it is not the same with an action, but is a 
mere relation : it is the activeness of something on another 
thing, being the opposite relation to the other, viz. a re- 
lation of power, or force, exerted by some cause towards 
another thing, which is the subject of the effect of that 
power. Indeed, the word action is frequently used to 
signify .something notjnerely relative, but more absolute, 
and a real existence ; as when we say an action; when 
the word is not used transitively, but absolutely, for some 
motion or exercise of body or mind, without any relation 
to any object or effect ; and as used thus, it is not prop- 
erly the opposite of passion, which ordinarily signifies 
nothing absolute, but merely the relation of being acted 
upon. And therefore, if the word action be used in the 



HOW THIS ABMIHIAH NOTION PART IT. 

like relative sense^ then actioD and passion are only two 
contrary relations. And it is no absurdity to suppose, 
that contrary relations may belong to the same thing, at 
the same time, with respect to diflferent things. So, to 
suppose that there are acts of the soul by which a man 
yoluntarily moves, and acts upon objects, and produces 
efiects, which yet themselves are effects of something else, 
and wherein the soul itself is the object of something act- 
ing upon, and influencing that, does not at all confound 
action and passion. The words may nevertheless be 
properly of opposite signification : there may be as true 
and real a difference between acting and being caused to 
acty though we should suppose the soul to be both in the 
same volition, as there is between living and being quick" 
enedy or made to live. It is no more a contradiction, to 
suppose that action may be the effect of some other cause 
besides the agent, or being that acts, than to suppose that 
life may be the effect of some other cause, besides the 
liver, or the being that lives, in whom life is caused to be. 
The thing which has led men into this inconsistent no* 
tion of action, when applied to volition, as though it were 
essential to this internal action, that the agent should be 
self-determined in it, and tliat the will should be the cause 
of -it, was probably this, — that, according to the 'sense of 
mankind, and the common use of language, it is so, with 
respect to men's external actions, which are what origin- 
ally, and according to the vulgar use and most proper 
sense of the word, are called actions. Men in these are 
self-directed, self-determined, and their wills are the cause 
of the motions of their bodies, and the, external things that 
are done ; so that unless men do them voluntarily, and of 
choice, and the action be determined by their antecedent 



SECT. II. PaOBABLY AROSE. 289 

Tolition, it is oo action or doing of theirs. Hence some 
Qieta physicians have been led unwarily, but exceeding ab- 
surdly, to suppose the same concerning volition itself, that 
that also must be determined by the will ; which is to be 
determined by antecedent volition, as the motion of the 
body is ; not considering the contradiction it implies. 

But it is very evident, that in the metaphysical distinc- 
tion between action and passion (though long since be- 
come common and the general vogue), due care has not 
been taken to conform language to the nature of things, 
or to any distinct, clear ideas ; — as it is in innumerable 
other philosophical, metaphysical terms, used in these 
disputes ; which has occasioned inexpressible difficulty ^ 
contention, error, and confusion. 

And thus probably it came to be thought that necessity 
was inconsistent with action, as these terms are applied to 
volition. First, these terms, action and necessity y are 
changed from their original meaning as signifying external 
voluntary action and constraint, (iri which meaning they 
are evidently inconsistent,) to signify quite other things, 
viz, volition itself, and certainty of existence. And when 
the change of signi&cation is made, care is not taken to 
make proper allowances and abatements for the difference 
of sense; but still the same things are unwarily attributed 
to action and necessity, in the new meaning of the words, 
which plainly. belonged to them in their first sense; and- 
on this ground, maxims are established without any 
real foundation, as though they were the most certain 
truths, and the most evident dictates of reason. 

But, however strenuously it is maintained, that what is 
necessary cannot be properly called action, and that a ne- 
cessary action is a contradiction, yet it is probable there

THE REASONS WflT SOME THINK IT CONTRARY TO COMMON 
SENSE, TO SUPPOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE NECESSARY, 
TO BE WORTHY OF EITHER PRAISE OR BLAME. 

It is abundantly affirmed and urged by Arminian wri- 
ters, that it is contrary to common sense, and the natural 
notions and apprehensions of mankind, to suppose others 
wise than that necessity (making no distinction between 
natural and moral necessity) is inconsistent with virtue 
and vice, praise and blame, reward and punishment. And 
their arguments from hence have been greatly triumphed 
in ; and have been not a little perplexing to many, who 
have been friendly to the truth, as cleari; revealed in the 
holy Scriptures : it has seemed to them indeed difficult, 
to reconcile Calvinisttc doctrines with the notions men 
commonly have of justice and equity. And the true rea- 
sons of it seem to be these that follow. 

I, Jt is indeed a very plain dictate of common sense 
that natural necessity is wholly inconsistent with just 



MCT. lU. CONTftA&Y TO COMlION 8BH8K. 



891 



praise or blame. If men do things wbicfa in themselves 
are very good, fit to be brought to pass, and very happy 
effects, properly against their wills, and eannot help it ; or 
do them from a necessity that is without their wills, or 
with which their wills have no concern or connection ; 
then it is a plain dictate of common sense, that it is none 
of their virtue, nor any moral good in them ; and that 
they are not worthy to be rewarded or praised, at all es- 
teemed, honored, or loved, on that account. And on the 
other hand, that if, from like necessity, they do those 
thbgs which in themselves are very unhappy and perni* 
cious, and do them because they cannot help it ; the ne- 
cessity is such, that it is all one whether they will them 
or no ; and the reason why they are done, is from neces- 
sity only, and not from their wills : it is a very plain die- 
tate of common sense, that they are not at all to blame ; 
there is no vice, fault, or moral evil at all in the effect 
done; nor are they who are thus necessitated, in any 
wise worthy to be punished, hated, or in the least disre- 
spected, on that account. 

In like manner, if things, in themselves good and de- 
sirable, are absolutely impossible, with a natural impossi- 
bility, the universal reason of mankind teaches, that this 
wholly and perfectly excuses persons in their not doing 
them. 

And it is also a plain dictate of common sense, that if 
the doing things in themselves good, or avoiding things in 
themselves evil, is not absolutely impossible^ with such a 
natural impossibility, but very difficulty with a natural 
difficulty, that is, a difficulty prior to, and not at all con- 
sisting in will and inclination itself, and which would re- 
main the same, let the inclination be what it will ; then a 



292 WBT CAL7INISM IS SUPPOSEB PART IV. 

person's neglect or omission is excused in some meoncre, 
though not wholly ; his sin is less aggravated than if the 
thing to be done were easy. And if instead of difficulty 
and hinderance, there be a contrary natural propensity io 
the state of things to the thing to be done, or efiect to be 
brought to pass, abstracted from any consideration of the 
inclination of the heart ; though the propensity be not so 
great as to amount to a natural necessity, yet «being some 
approach to it, so that the doing the good thing be very 
much from this natural tendency in the state of things, 
and but Jittle from a good inclination ; then it is a dictate 
of common sense, that there is so much the less virtue in 
what is done ; and so it is less praiseworthy and rewarda* 
ble. The reason is easy, viz. because such a natural 
propensity or tendency is an approach to natural necessity ; 
and the greater the propensity, still so much the nearer 
is the approach to necessity. And, therefore, as natural 
necessity takes away or shuts out all virtue, so this pro* 
pensity approaches to an abolition of virtue ; that is, it 
diminishes it. And, on the other hand, natural difficulty, 
in the state of things, is an approach to natural impossi- 
bility. And as the latter, when it is complete and abso* 
lute, wholly takes away blame, so such difficulty takes 
away some blame, or diminishes blame ; and makes the 
thing done to be less worthy of punishment. 

II. Men, in their first use of such phrases as these, must, 
cannot, cannot help it, cannot avoid it, necessary, unable, 
impossible, unavoidable, irresistible, etc. use them to sig- 
nify a necessity of constraint or restraint, a natural neces* 
sity^or impossibility ; or some necessity that the will has 
nothing to do in ; which may be, whether men' will or no ; 
and which may be supposed to be just the same, let men's 



SECT. 111. CONTRAftT TO COMMON SENSE. 293 

inclinatioDS and desires be what they will. Such kind of 
terms io their original use, I suppose, among all nations, 
are relative; carrying in their signiGcation (as was before 
observed) a reference or respect to some Qontrary will, 
desire, or endeavor, which, it is supposed, is, or may be, 
in the case. . All men find, and begin to find in early 
childhood, that there are innumerable things that catinot 
be done, which they desire to do ; and innumerable things, 
which they are averse to, that must be, they cannot avoid 
them, they will be, whether they choose them or no. It 
is to express this necessity, which men so soon and so 
often find, and which so greatly and early affects them in 
innumerable cases, that such terms and phrases are first 
formed ; and it is to signify such a necessity, that they are 
first used, and that they are most constantly used, in the 
common affairs of life ; and not to signify any such meta- 
physical, speculative, and abstract notion, as that connect 
tion in the nature or course of things, which is between 
the subject and predicate of a proposition, and which is 
the foundation of the certain truth of that proposition; to 
signify which, they who employ themselves in philoso- 
phical inquiries into the first origin and metaphysical rela- 
tions and dependencies of things, have borrowed these 
terms, for want of others. But we grow up from our 
cradles in a use of such terms and phrases entirely different 
from this, and carrying a sense exceeding diverse from 
that in which they are commonly used in the controversy 
between Arminians and Calvinists. And it being, as was 
said before, a dictate of the universal sense of mankind, 
evident to us as soon as we begin to think, that the neces^ 
sity signified by these terms, in the sense in which we first 
learn them, does excuse persons and free them from all 

25* • 



S94 WHY CALVINISM IS SUPPOSED PART ir» 

fault or blame ; hence our idea of excusableness or fault- 
lessness is tied to these terms and phrases by a strong 
habit^ which is begun in childhood, as soon as we begto 
to speak, and grows up with us, and is strengthened by 
constant use and custom, the connection growing stronger 
and stronger. 

The habitual connection which is in men's minds be- 
tween blamelessness and those forementioned terms, mtut, 
cannot, unable, necessary, impossible, unavoidable, etc. 
becomes very strong ; because as soon as ever men begin 
to use reason and speech, they have occasion to excuse 
themselves, from the natural necessity signified by these 
terms, in numerous instances — I cannot do it ; I could 
not kelp it. And ait mankind have constant and daily 
occasion to use such phrases in this sense, to excuse them- 
selves and others, in almost all the concerns of life, with 
respect to disappointments and things that happen, which 
concern and aSect ourselves and others, that are hurtful, 
or disagreeable to us or them, or things desirable, that we 
or others fail of. 

That a being accustomed to an union of different ideas, 
from early childhood, makes the habitual connection ex- 
^ ceeding strong, as tliough such connection were owing to 
nature, is manifest in innumerable instances. It is alto- 
gether by such an habitual connection of ideas, that men 
judge of the bigness or distance of the objects of sight, 
from their appearance. Thus, it is owing to such a con- 
nection early established, and growing up with a person, 
that he judges a mountain, which be sees at ten miles' 
distance, to be bigger than his nose, or further off than 
the end of it. Having been used so long to join a con- 
siderable distance and magnitude with such an appear- 



SECT. III. CONTRARY TO COlflfON SEM8E. 295 

ance, men imagine it is by a dictate of natural sense: 
whereas, it would.be quite otherwise with one that had 
his eyes newly opened, who had been born blind; he 
would have the same visible appearance, but natural sense 
would dictate no such thing, concerning the magnitude or 
distance of what appeared. 

III. When men, after they had been so habituated to 
connect ideas of innocency or blamelessness with such 
terms, that the union seems to be the effect of mere na- 
ture, come to hear the same terms used, and learn to use 
them themselves, in the fore-mentioned new and meta* 
physical sense, to signify quite another sort of necessity, 
which has no such kind of relation to a contrary supposa- 
ble will and endeavor ; the notion of plain and manifest 
blamelessness, by this means, is, by a strong prejudice, 
insensibly and unwarily transferred to a case to which it 
by no means belongs : the change of the use of the terms, 
to a signification which is very diverse, not being taken 
notice of, or adverted to. And there are several reasons 
why it is not. 

1 . The terms, as used by philosophers, are not very 
distinct and clear in their meaning : few use them in a 
fixed, determined sense. On the contrary, their meaning 
is very vague and confused. Which is what commonly 
happens to the words used to signify things intellectual and 
moral, and to express what Mr. Locke calls mixed modes. 
If men had a clear and distinct understanding of what is 
intended by these metaphysical terms, they would be 
able more easily to compare them with their original and 
common sense ; and so would not be so easily led into 
delusion by no sort of terms in the world, as by words of 
this sort. 



396 WHT CALVINISM 18 SUPPOSED PART IV. 

2. The change of the signification of the terms is the 
more insensible, because the things signified, though in- 
deed very dififerent, yet db in some generals agree. In 
necessity J that which is vulgarly so called, there is a 
strong connection between the thing said to be necessary^ 
and something antecedent to it in the order of nature ^ so 
there is also in philosophical necessity. And though in 
both kinds of necessity the connection cannot be called 
by that name, with relation to an opposite will or endea- 
vor, to which it is superior ; which is the case in vulgar 
necessity^; jret, in both, the connection is pridr to will and 
endeavor, and so, in some respect, superior. In both 
kinds of necessity, there is a foundation for some certain- 
ly of the proposition that affirms the event. — ^The terms 
used being the same, and the things signified agreeing in 
these and s6me other general circumstances ; and the 
expressions, as used by philosophers, being not well defin- 
ed, and so of obscure and loose signification ; hence per- 
sons are not aware of the great diflference : and the no- 
tions of innocence or faultiness, which were so strongly 
associated with them, and were strictly united in their 
minds, ever since they can remember, remain united with 
them still, as if the union were altogether natural and ne- 
cessary : and they that go about to make a separation, 
seem to them to do great violence, even to nature itself* 

IV. Another reason why it appears difficult to recon- 
cile it with reason, that men should be blamed for that 
which is necessary with a moral necessity (which, as was 
observed before, is a species of philosophical necessity), 
is, that for want of due consideration, men inwardly en- 
tertain that apprehension, that this necessity may be 
against V men's wills and sincere endeavors. They go 



SECT. tl. CONTRAHlr tX> COltMON SfiNSH. 29t 

away with that notion; that men may truly .will, and 
wish, and strive, that it may be otherwise, but that invin- 
cible necessity stands in the way. And many think thus 
concerning themselves : some, that are wicked men, think 
they wish they were good, that they loved God and ho- 
liness ; but yet do not find that their wishes produce the 
effect. — The reasons why men think so, are as follow : 
(i) They find what may be called an indirect willing- 
ness to have a better will, in the manner before observed. 
For it is impossible, and a contradiction, to suppose the 
will to be directly and properly against itself. And they 
do not consider that, this indirect willingness is entirely a 
different thing from properly willing the thing that is the 
duty and virtue required ; and that there is no virtue in that 
sort of willingness which they have. They do not consid- 
er, that the volitions which a wicked man may have that 
he loved God, are no acts of the will at all against the 
moral evil of not loving God ; but only some disagreea- 
ble consequences. But the making the requisite distinc- 
tion requires more care of reflection and thought than 
most men are used to. And men, through a prejudice in 
their own favor, are disposed to think well of their own 
desires and dispositions, and to account them good and 
virtuous, though their respect to virtue be only indirect 
and remote, and it is nothing at all that is virtuous that 
truly excites or terminates their inclinations. (2) Anoth- 
er thing that insensibly leads and beguiles men into a sup- 
position that this moral necessity.or impossibility is, or 
may be, against men's wills and true endeavors, is the 
derivation and formation of the terms themselves, that 
are often used to express it, which is such as seems di- 
rectly to point to, and holds this forth, Such words^ for

instance, as wuAUy unavoidable^ impa$sible^ irreMisMlCf 
which carry a plain reference to a supposable power exer- 
ted| endeavors used, resistance made, in opposition to the 
necessity : and the persons that bear them, not consider- 
ing nor suspecting but that they are used in their proper 
sense ; that sense being therefore understood, there does 
naturally and as it were necessarily, arise in their minds a 
supposition, that it may be so indeed, that true desires and 
endeavors may take place, but that invincible necessity 
stands in the way, and renders them vain and to no effect. 
V. Another thing, which makes persons more ready to 
suppose it to be contraryto reason, that men should be ex- 
posed to the punishments threatened to sin, for doing those 
things which are morally necessary, or not doing those 
things morally impossible, is, that imagination strengthens 
the argument, and adds greatly to the power and influ- 
ence of the seeming reasons against it, from the great- 
ness of that punishment. To allow that they may be 
justly exposed to a small punishment, would not be so 
difficult. Whereas, if there were any good reason in the 
case, if it were truly a dictate of reason, that such neces- 
sity was inconsistent with faultiness, or just punishment, 
the demonstration would be equally certain with respect 
to a small punishment, or any punishment at all, as a very 
great one ; but it is not equally easy to the imagination. 
They that argue against the justice of damning men for 
those things that are thus necessary, seem to make their 
argument the stronger, by setting forth the greatness of 
the punishment in strong expressions : — That a man 
should be cast into eternal burnings^ that he should bt 
made to fry in hell to all eternity, for those things which 
he had no power to avoid, and w€u under a fatal j unfrus" 
trable, invincible necessity of doing.

IT IB AGREEABLE TO COMMON SENSE AND THE NATURAL NO* 
TIONS OP MANKIND, TO SUPPOSE MORAL NECESSITY TO BE 
CONSISTENT WITH PRAISE AND BLAME, REWARD AND PUN* 
ISHMENT. 

Whether the reasons that have been given, why it 
appears difficult to some persons to reconcile with com* 
mon sense the prai9ing or blaming, rewarding or punish* 
ing those things which are morally necessary, are thought 
satisfactory, or not ; yet it most evidently appears, by the 
following things, that if this matter be rightly understood, 
setting aside all delusion arising from the impropriety and 
ambiguity of terms, this is not at all inconsistent with the 
natural apprehensions of mankind, and that sense of things 
which is found everywhere in the common people, who 
are furthest from having their thoughts perverted fixxn 
their natural channel, by metaphysical and philosophical 
subtilties ; but, on the contrary, altogether agreeable io, 
and the very voice and dictate o/this natural and vulgar 
sense. 

I. This will appear, if we consider what the vulgar no* 
tion of blameworihiness is. The idea which the com- 
mon people, through all. ages and nations, have of faulti* 
ness, I suppose to be plainly this ; a person^ s being or. 
doing wrongy toith his own will and pleasure ; contain* 
ing these two things : 1. HU doing wrong when he 
does as he pleases : 2. His pleasttres being wrong. Or, 
in other words, perhaps more intelligibly expressing their 
notion, a person's having his heart wrongs and doing 



300 KECeSSART VIXTUB9 KTC. PART IT. 

wrong from his heart. And this is the sum total of the 
matter. 

The common people do not ascend up in their reflec- 
tions and abstractions to the metaphysical sources, rela- 
tions, and dependencies of things, in order to form their 
notion of faultiness or blameworthiness. They do not 
wait till they have decided by their refinings, what first 
determines the will ; whether it be determined by some- 
thing extrinsic or intrinsic ; whether volition determines 
volition, or whether the understanding determines the will ; 
whether there be any such thing as metaphysicians mean 
by contingence (if they have any meaning) ; whether 
there be a sort of a strange, unaccountable sovereignty m 
»tbe will, in the exercise of which, by its own sovereign 
acts, it brings to pass all its own sovereign acts. They 
do not take any part of their notion of fault or blame from 
the resolution of any such questions. If this were the 
case, there are multitudes, yea the far greater part of 
mankind, nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thou- 
sand, would live and die without having any such notion 
as that of fault ever entering into their heads, or without 
so much as one having any conception that nny body was 
to be either blamed or commended for anything. To be 
sure it would be a long time before men came to have 
such notions. Whereas it is manifest, they are some of 
the first notions that appear in children ;. who discover, as 
soon as they can think, or speak, or act ai all as rational 
creatures, a sense of desert. And certainly, in forming 
their notion of it, they make no use of metaphysics. All 
the ground they go upon consists in these two things, eo?- 
perience, and a natural sensation of a certain fitness or 
agreeableness which there is in uniting such moral evil as is 



SECT. IT. AG&ESABLC TO COMMON SENSE. 301 

above described, viz. a being or doing wrong with the 
willf and resentment in others, and pain inflicted on tbe 
person in whom this moral evil is. Which natural sense 
is what we call by the name of conscience* 

It is true the common people and children, in their no- 
tion of any faulty act or deed, of any person, do suppose 
that it is the person's oum act and deed. But this is all 
that belongs to what they understand by a thing's being 
a person's own deed or action ; even that it is something 
done by him of choice. That some exercise or motion 
should begin of itself, does not belong to their notion of 
an action or doing. If so, it would belong to their no- 
tion of it, that it is something which is the cause of its 
own beginning ; and that is as much as to say, that it is * 
before it begins to be. Nbr is their notion of an action^ 
some motion or exercise that begins accidentally, without 
any cause or reason ; for that is contrary to one of the 
prime dictates of common sense, namely, that everything 
that begins to bej has some cause or reason why it is. 

The common people, in their notion of a faulty or praise- 
worthy deed or work done by any one, do suppose that 
the maii does it in the exercise o{ liberty. But then their 
notion of liberty is only a person's having opportunity of 
doing as he pleases. They have no notion of liberty 
consisting in the will's first acting, and so causing its own 
acts ; and determining, and so causing its own determina- 
tions ; or choosing, and so causing its own choice. Such 
a notion of liberty is what none have, but those that have 
darkened their own minds with confused metaphysical 
speculation, and abstruse. and ambiguous terms. If a man 
is not restrained from acting as h'ls will determines, or 

constrained to act otherwise ; then he has liberty, accor-

ding to commoQ notions of liberty, without taking into 
the idea that grand contradiction of all, th6 determinations 
of a noan's free will being th^ effects of the deterinina* 
tions of his free will. — Nor have men commonly any no- 
tion of freedom consisting in indifference. For if so, then 
it would be agreeable to their notion, that the greater in* 
difference men act with, the more freedom they act with ; 
whereas the reverse is true. He that, in acting, proceeds 
with the fullest inclination, does what he does with the 
greatest freedom, according to common sense. And so 
far is it from being s^reeable to common sense, that such 
liberty as consists in indifference is requisite to praise or 
blame, that, on the contrary, the dictate of every man's nat- 
ural sense through the world is, that the further he is from 
being indifferent in his acting good or evil, and the more 
he does either with full and strong inclination, the more 
is he esteemed or abhorred, commended or condemned. 
y( II. If it were inconsistent with the common sense of 
mankind, that men should be either to be blamed or com- 
mended in any volitions they have, or fail of, in case of 
moral necessity or impossibility ; then it would surely 
also be agreeable to the same sense and reason of mankind, 
that the nearer the case approaches to such a moral ne- 
cessity or impossibility, either through a strong antecedent 
moral propensity, on the one hand,"*^ or a great antecedent 
opposition and difficulty, on the other, the nearer does it 
approach to a being neither blamable noj; commendable ; 
so that acts exerted with such preceding propensity, would 
be worthy of proportionably less praise ; and when omit-

.will deny. 



SECT. IV« AGREEABLE TO COATHON SENSE. 303 

ted, the act being attended with such difficulty, the omis- 
sion would be worthy of the less blame. It is so, as was 
i^bserved before, with natural necessity and impossibility, 
propensity and difficulty : as it is a plain dictate of the 
sense of all mankind, ihat natural necessity and impossi- 
bility take away all blame and praise ; and, therefore, 
that the nearer the approach is to these, through previous 
propensity or difficulty, so praise and blame are propor- 
tionably diminished. And if it were as much a dictate 
of common sense, that moral necessity of doing, or im- 
possibility of avoiding, takes away all praise and blame, 
as that natural necessity or impossibility does this ; then, 
by a perfect parity of reason, it would be as much the dic- 
tate of common sense, that an approach to moral neces- 
sity of doing, or impossibility of avoiding, diminishes praise 
and blame, as that an approach to natural necessity and 
impossibility does so. It is equally the voice of common 
sense, that persons are excusable in part in neglecting 
things difficult against their wills, as that they are exctc- 
sable wholly in neglecting things impossible against their 
wills. And if it made no difference, whether the impossi- 
bility were natural, and against the will, or moral, lying in 
the will, with regard to excusableness ; so neither would 
it make any difference, whether the difficulty, or approach 
to necessity, be natural against the will, or moral) lying 
in the propensity of the will. 

But it is apparent, that the reverse of these things is 
true. If there be |^n approach to a moral necessity in a 
man's exertion of good acts of will, they being the exer* 
cise of a strong propensity to good, and a very powerful 
love to virtue ; it is so far from being the dictate of com- 
mon sense, that be is less virtuous, and the less to be es- 



904 MBCBMART VI&TUC| XTC. PART IT* 

teemed, loved, and praised ; that it is agreeable to the 
natural notions of all mankind, that he is so much the bet- 
ter man, worthy of greater respect, and higher commen* 
dation. And the stronger the inclination is, and the nearer 
it approaches to necessity in that i[espect ; or to impossi* 
bility of neglecting the virtuous act, or of doing a vicious 
one ; still the more virtuous, and worthy of higher com- 
mendation. And, on the other hand, if a man exerts evil 
acts of mind ; as, for instance, acts of pride or malice, 
from a rooted and strong habit or principle of haughtiness 
and maliciousness, and a violent propensity of heart to 
such acts ; according to the natural sense of men, he is 
so far from being the less hateful and blamable on that 
account, that he is so much the more worthy to be detes- 
ted and condemned by all that observe him. 

Moreover, it is manifest that it is no part of the notion, 
which mankind commonly have of a blamable or praise- 
worthy act of the will, that it is an act which is not deter-^ 
mined by an antecedent bias or motive, but by the sovereign 
power of the will itself; because, if so, the greater band 
such causes have in determining any acts of the will, so 
much the less virtuous or vicious would they be accounted; 
and the less hand, the more virtuous or vicious. Whereas 
the reverse is true : men do not think a good act to be 
the less praiseworthy, for the agent's being much deters 
mined in it by a good inclination or a good motive, but 
the more. And if good inclination or motive has but little 
inOuence in determining the agent, they do not think his 
act so much the more virtuous, but the less. And so 
concerning evil acts, which are determined by evil motives 
or inclinations. ^ 

Yea, if it be supposed, that good or evil dispositktns are 



8SCT. IT. AGREEABUB TO COMMON SENSE. 305 

implanted in the hearts of men by nature itself, (wbicb| 
it is certain, is vulgarly supposed in innumerable cases), 
yet it is not commonly supposed, that men are worthy of 
no praise or dispraise for such dispositions ; although what 
is natural is undoubtedly necessary, nature being prior to 
all acts of the will whatsoever. Thus, for instance, if a 
man appears to be of a very haughty or malicious dispo- 
sition, and is supposed to be so by his natural temper, it 
is no vulgar notion, no dictate of the common sense and 
apprehension of men, that such dispositions are no vices 
or moral evils, or that such persons are not worthy of dis* 
esteem, or odium and dishonor; or that the proud or 
malicious acts which flow from such natural dispositions, : 
are worthy of no resentment. Yea, such vile natural dis- ' ; 
positions, and the strength of them, will commonly be / 
mentioned rather as an aggravation of the wicked acts 
that come from such a fountain, than an extenuation of j C 
them. Its being natural for men to act thus, is often oh* 
served by men in the height of their indignation : they 
will say, " It is his very nature ; he is of a vile natural 
temper ; it is as natural to him to act so, as it is to breathe ; 
he cannot help serving the devil," etc. But it is not thus 
with regard to hurtful, mischievous things, that any are 
the subjects or occasions of, by natural necessity, against 
their inclinations. In such a case, the necessity, by the 
common voice of mankind, will be spoken of as a full 
excuse. — ^Thus, it is very plain, that common sense makes 
a vast difference between these two kinds of necessity, 
as to the judgment it makes of their influence on the 
moral quality and desert of men's actions. 

And these dictates of men's minds are so natural and 
necessary, that it may be very much doubted whether thf

Arminians themselves have ever got rid of them : jeuj 
their greatest doctors, that have gone furthest in defence 
of their tnetaphyncal notions of liberty, and have brought 
their arguments to their greatest strength, and, as they sup- 
pose, to a demonstration, against the consistence of virtue 
and vice with any necessity ; it is to be questioned, wheth- 
er there is so much as one of them, but that, tf he sufier* 
ed very much from the injurious acts of a man under the 
power of an invincible haughtiness and malignancy of tem- 
per, would not, from the fore-mentioned natpral sense of 
mind, resent it far otherwise, than if as great sufferings came 
upon him from the wind that blows, and fire that burns, 
by natural necessity ; and otherwise than he would, if he 
suffered as much from the conduct of a man perfectly 
delirious ; yea, though he first brought bis distraction upon 
him some way by his own fault. 

Some seem to disdain the distinction that we make be- 
tween natural and moral necetsiiyj as though it were al- 
together impertinent in this controversy : '^ that which is 
necessary (say they) is necessary ; it is that which must 
be, and cannot be prevented. And that which is impos- 
sible, is impossible, and cannot be done : and therefore 
none can be to blame for not doing it.'^ And such com- 
parisons are made use of, as the commanding of a man 
to walk who has lost his legs, and condemning and pun- 
ishing him for not obeying ; inviting and calling upon a 
man whois shut up in a strong prison, to come forth, etc. 
But, in these things, Arminians are very unreasonable. 
Let common sense determine whether there be not a 
great difference between these two cases ; the one, that 
of a man who has offended his prince, and is cast into 
prison ; and after he has lain tber^a while, the king comes 



SECT. IT. CALTimSlf CONSISTENT, ETC. 307 

to him, calls bim to come forth to bim ; aod tells biro, 
that if he will do so, ,and will fal) down before him, and 
humbly beg his pardon, be shall be forgiveo, and set at liber- 
ty, aod also be greatly enriched, and advanced to honor : 
the prisoner heartily repents of the folly and wickedness 
of his offence against bis prince, is thoroughly disposed to 
abase himself, and accept of the king's offer ; but is con- 
fined by strong walls, with gates of brass, and bars of iron. 
The other case is, that of a man who is of a very unrea- 
sonable spirit, of a haughty, ungrateful, wilful disposition ; 
and, moreover, has been brought up in traitorous princi- 
ples, and has his heart possessed with an extreme and in- 
veterate enmity to his lawful sovereign ; and for his re- 
beUioi|is cas( into prison, and lies long there, loaden with 
heavy chains, and in miserable circumstances. At length 
the compassionate prince comes to the prison, orders his 
chains to be knocked off, and his prison-doors to be set 
wide open ; calls to him, and tells him, if he will come 
forth to him, and fall down before him, acknowledge that 
he has treated him unworthily, and ask his forgiveness ; 
he shall be forgiven, set at liberty, and set in a place of 
great dignity and profit in his court. But he is stout and 
stomacliful, and full of haughty malignity, that he cannot 
be willing to accept tlie offer : his rooted strong pride and 
malice have perfect power over bim, and as it were bind 
him, by binding bis heart : the opposition of his heart 
has the mastery over him, having an influence on his mind 
far superior to the king's grace and condescension, and to 
all his kind offers and promises. Now, is it agreeable to 
common sense to assert, and stand to it, that there is no 
difference between these two cases, as to any worthiness 
of blame in the prisoners ; because, forsooth, there is a 



308 CALVINISM COKSISTIfillT PART IV. 

necessity in both, aad the required act in each case is im- 
possible ? It is true, a man's evil dispositions may be as 
strong and immovable as the bars of a castle. But who 
cannot see, that when a man, in the latter case, is said to 
be unable to obey the command, the expression is used 
improperly, and not in the sense it has originally, and in 
common speech ; and that it may properly be said to be 
ip the rebel's power to come out of prison, seeing he can 
easily do it if be pleases ; though by reason of his vile tem- 
per of heart, which is fixed and rooted, it is impossible 
that it should please him ? 

. Upon the whole, I presume there is no person of good 
understanding, who impartially considers the things which 
have been observed, but will allow, ^hat it is not evident, 
from the dictates of the common sense, or natural notions 
of mankind, that moral necessity is inconsistent with praise 
and blame. And, therefore, if the Arminians would prove 
any such inconsistency, it must be by some philosophical 
and metaphysical arguments, and not common sense. 

There is a grand illusion in the pretended demonstra- 
tion of Arminians from common sense. The main strength 
of all these demonstrations lies in that prejudice, that ari- 
ses through the insensible change of the use and meaning 
of such terms as liberty, ahhy unable^ necessary y impossi^ 
Hey unavoidable^ invincible^ action^ etc. from their origi- 
nal and vulgar sense, to a metaphysical s^nse, entirely di- 
verse ; and the strong connection of the ideas of blame- 
lessness, etc. with some of these terms, by a habit con- 
tracted and established while these terms were used in 
their first meaning. This prejudice and delusion is the 
foundation of all those positions, they lay down as max- ' 
ims, by which most of the Scriptures, which they allege. 



8£CT. ir. . WITH COMMON SENSE. 309 

in this controversy, are interpreted, and on which all their 
pompous demonstrations from Scripture and reason depend* 
From this secret delusion and prejudice they have almost 
all their advantages; it is the strength of their bulwarks, 
and the edge of their weapons. And this is the main 
ground of all the right they have to treat their neighbors 
in so assuming a manner, and to insult others, perhaps as 
wise and good as tiiemselves, as weak bigotSj men that 
dw%ll in the dark caves of superstition, perversely set, 
obstinately shutting their eyes against the noon-day lights 
enemies to common sense, maintaining the first-born of 
absurdities, etc. etc. But perhaps an impartial considera- 
tion of the things which have been observed in the prece* 
ding parts of this Inquiry, may enable the lovers of truth 
better to judge, whose doctrine is indeed absurd, abstruse, 
self contradictory, and inconsistent with common sense, 
and many ways repugnant to the universal dictates of the 
reason of mankind. 

CoroL From things which have been observed, it will 
follow, that it is agreeable to common sense to suppose 
that the glorified saints have not their freedom at all di-* 
minished in any respect ; a^id that God himself has the 
highest* possible freedom, according to the true and prop- 
er meaning of the term ; and that he is, in the highest 
possible respect, an agent, and active in the exercise of 
his inHqite holiness ; though he acts therein, in the high* 
est degree, necessarily ; and his actions of this kind are 
in the highest, most absolutely perfect manner virtuous 
and praiseworthy ; and are so, ibr that very reason, h^ 
cause they are most perfectly necessary,

SECTION V. 

CONCERNING THOSE OBJECTIONS, THAT THIS SCHEME OF NE- 
CESSITY RENDERS* ALL MEANS AND ENDEAVORS POR THE 
.\' AVOIDING OF SIN, OR THE OBTAINING VIRTUE AND HOLI- 

NESS VAIN AND TO NO PURPOSE ; AND THAT IT MAKES MEN 
NO MORE THAN MERE MACHINES IN AFFAIRS OF MORALITY 
AND RELIGION. 

Arminians say, if it be so, that sin and virtue come to 
pass by a necessity consisting in a sure connection ofcaus- 
es and effects, antecedents and consequents, it can never 
be worth the while to use any means or endeavors to ob- 
tain the one, and avoid the other; seeing no endeavors can 
alter the futurity of the event, which is become necessary 
by a connection already established. 

But I desire .that this matter may be fully considered ; 
and that it may be examined with a thorough strictness^ 
whether It will follow, that endeavors and means, in order 
to avoid or obtain any future thing, must be more in vain, 
on the supposition of such a connection of antecedents and 
consequents, than if the contrary be supposed. 

For endeavors to be in vain, is for them not to be suc- 
cessful ; that is to say, for them not eventually to be the 
means of the thing aimed at, which cannot be but in one of 
these two ways ; either, ^rs^, that although the means are 
used, yet the event aimed at does not follow ; or, second* 
ly, if the event does follow, it is not because of the means, 
or from any connection or dependence of the event on the 
means : the event would have come to pass as well without 
the means as with them. If either of these two things is the 



SECT. y. BT CALV1NI8T1C PRINCIPLES. 311 

case, then the means are not properly successful, and are 
truly in vain. The successfulness or unsuccessfulness of 
means, in order to an eSect, or their being in vain or not 
in. vain, consists in those means being connected or not 
connected with the elBTect, in such a manner as this, viz, 
that the effect is with the means, and not without them ; 
or, that the being of the effect is, on the one hand, con- 
nected with means, and the want of the effect, on the 
other hand, is connected with the want of the means. If 
there be such a connection as this between means and 
end, the means are not in vain ; the more there is of such 
a connection, the further they are from being in vain ; 
and the less of such a connection, the more they are in 
vain. 

Now, therefore, the question to be answered, (in order 
to determine, whether it follows from this doctrine of the 
necessary connection between foregoing things and conse- 
quent ones, that mejins used in order to any effect, are more 
in vain than they would be otherwise), is, whether it fol- 
lows from it that there is less of the forementioed connec- 
tion between means and effect ; that is, whether, on the 
supposition of there being a real end true connection be- 
tween antecedent things and consequent ones, there must 
be less of a connection between means and effect, than 
on the supposition of there being no fixed connection be- 
tween antecedent things and consequent ones ; and the 
very stating of this question is sufficient to answer it. It 
must appear to every one that will open his eyes, that 
this question cannot be affirmed without the grossest ab- 
surdity and inconsistence. Means are foregoing things, 
and effects are following things. And if there were no 
connection between foregoing things and following ones, 



319 KWACATORS HOT BCin>.ERX]> TAIN PART IT. 

there could be no connection between means and end i 
and so all means would be wholly vain and fruitless. 
For it is by virtue of some connection only, that they be- 
come successful. It b some connection observed or re- 
vealed, or otherwise known, between antecedent things 
and following ones, that is what directs in the choice of 
means. And if there were no such thing as an establish- 
ed connection, there could be no choice as to means ; one 
thing would have no more tendency to an effect than an- 
other ; there would be no such thing as tendency in the 
case. All those things which are successful means of oth- 
er things, do therein prove connected antecedents of 
them ; and therefore, to assert that a fixed connection be- 
tween antecedents and consequents makes means vain 
and useless, or stands in the way to hinder the connec- 
tion between means and end, is just as ridiculous, as to 
say, that a connection between antecedents and conse- 
quents stands in the way to hinder a connection between 
antecedents and consequents. 

Nor can any supposed connection of the succession or 
train of antecedents and consequents, from the very be- 
ginning of all things, the connection being made already 
sure and necessary, either by established laws of nature, 
or by these together with a decree of sovereign immedi- 
ate interpositions of Divine power, on such and such oc- 
casions, or any other way (if any other there be) ; I say, 
no such necessary connection of a series of antecedents 
and consequents can in the least tend to hinder, but that 
the means we use may belong to the series ; and so may 
be some of those antecedents which are connected with 
the consequents we aim at, in the established course of 
things. Endeavors which we use, are things that exist ; 



SECT. IV. Br oalvinisti€ principles. 319 

and tlierefore tbey belong to the general chain of events ; 
all the parts of which chain are supposed to be connect- 
ed ; and so endeavors are supposed to be connected 
with some effects, or som» consequent things or other. 
And certainly this does not hinder but that the events 
they are connected with, may be those which we aim at, 
and which we choose, because we judge them most like* 
ly to have a connection with those events, from the es<* 
tablisbed order and course of things which w^ observe, 
or from something in Divine revelation. 

Let us suppose a real and sure connection between a 
man's having his eyes open in the clear day*Iight, with 
good organs of sight, and seeing ; so that seeing is connect- 
ed with his opening bis eyes, and not seeing with his not 
opening his eyes ; and also the like connection between 
such a man's attempting to open his eyes, and his actual- 
ly doing it : the supposed established connection between 
these antecedents and consequents, let the connection be 
never so sure and necessary, certainly does not prove 
that it is in vain for a roan i^ such circumstances to at- 
tempt to open his eyes, in order to seeing : his aiming 
at that event, and the use of the means, being the effect 
ofhis will, does not break the connection, or binder the 
success. 

So that the objection we are upon does not lie against 
the doctrine of the necessity of events by a certainty of 
connection and consequence ; on the contrary, it is truly 
forcible against the Arminran doctrine of contingence 
and self-determination ; which is inconsistent with such 
a connection. If there be no connection between those 
events wherein virtue and vice consist, and anything an- 
tecedent ; then there is no connection between these events 

27 



314 CALVINISM DOGS NOT ENCOURAGE SLOTH. PABT IT. 

and any means or endeavors used in order to them ; and if 
so, then those means must be in vain* The less there is 
ofconnection between foregoing things and following Ones, 
so much the less there is between means and end, endea- 
vors and success ; and in the same proportion are means 
and endeavors ineffectual and in vain. 

It will follow from Arminian principles, that there is 
no degree of connection between virtue or vice, and any 
foregoing event or thing ; or, in other words, that the de- 
termination of the existence of virtue or vice does not in 
the least depend on the influence of anything that comes 
to pass antecedently, from which the determination of its 
existence is, as its cause, means, or ground : because, so 
far as it is so, it is not from self-determination ; and, there- 
fore, so far there is nothing of the nature of virtue or vice* 
And so it follows, that virtue and vice are not at all, in 
any degree, dependent upon, or connected with, any 
foregoing event or existence, as its cause, ground, or 
means* And if so, then all foregoing means must be to- 
tally in vain. 

Hence it follows, that there cannot, in any consistence 
with the Arminian scheme, be any reasonable ground of 
so much as a conjecture concerning the consequence of 
any means and endeavors, in order to escaping vice, or 
obtaining virtue, or any choice or preference of means, as 
having a greater probability of success by some than oth- 
ers; either from any natural connection or dependence of 
the end on the means, or through any divine constitution, 
or revealed way of God's bestowing or bringing to pass 
these things, in consequence of any means, endeavors, 
prayers, or deeds. . Conjectures, in this latter case, de- 
pend on a supposition, that God himself is the giver, or 



SECT. T. CALVINISM BOES NOT ENCOURAGE SLOTH. 315 

determining cause, of the events sought : but if they de- 
pend on self-determination, then God is not the determin- 
ing or disposing author of them ; and if these things are 
not of his disposal, then no conjecture can be made, from 
any revelation he has given, concerning any way or method 
of his disposal of them. 

Yea, on these principles, it will not only follow^, that 
men cannot have any reasonable ground of judgment or 
conjecture, that their means and endeavors to obtain vir- 
tue, or avoid vice, will be successful, but they may be 
sure they will not ; they may be cettain that they will be 
in vain ; and that if ever the thing, which they seek, comes 
to pass, it will not be at all owing to the means they use. 
For means and endeavors can have no effect at all, in or- 
der to obtain the end, but in one of those two ways ; either 
(]) through a natural tendency and influence to prepare 
and dispose the mind more to virtuous acts, either by 
causing the disposition of the heart to be more in favor of 
such acts, or by bringing the mind more into the view of 
powerful motives and inducements ; or (2) by putting 
persons more in the way of God's bestowment of the bene- 
fit. But neither of these can be the case. Not the lat- 
ter , for, as has been just now observed, it does not consist 
with the Arminian notion of self-determination, which 
they suppose essential to virtue, that God should be the 
bestower, or (which is the sanae thing) the determining, 
disposing author of virtue. Not the former ; for natural 
influence and tendency supposes causality and connection, 
and supposes necessity of event, which is inconsistent 
with Arminian liberty. A tendency of means, by bias-* 
sing the heart in favor of virtue, or by bringing the will 
under the influence and power of motives in its determina-

lions, are both incoDsisteot with ArminiaD liberty of will,

ts bas been largely demonstrated. 

But for the more full removal of this prejudice against 
the doctrine of necessity, which bas been maintained, as 
though it tended to encourage a total neglect of all en- 
deavors as vain ; the following things may be considered. 

The question is not, Whether men may not thus im- 
prove this doctrine, — ^we know that many true and whole- 
some doctrines are abused : but. Whether the doctrine 
gives any just occasion for such an improvement ; or 
whether, on the suppontion of the truth of the doctrine, 
such a use of it would not be unreasonable ? If any 
shall affirm, that it woold not, but that the very nature of 
the doctrine is such as gives just occasion for it, it must 
be on this supposition ; namely, that such an invariable 
necessity of all things already settled, must render the 
interposition of all means, endeavors, conclusions, or ac- 
tions of ours, in order to the obtaining any future end 
whatsoever, perfectly insignificant ; because they cannot 
an the least alter or v^ry the course and series of tlungs, 
in any. event or circumstance ; all being already fixed un- 
alterably by necessity ; and that therefore it is folly for 
men to use any means ^br any end; but their wisdom to 
save themselves the trouble of endeavors, and take their 
ease. No person can draw such an inference from this 
doctrine, and come to such a conclusion, without contra- 
dicting himself, and going counter to the very principles 
he pretends to act upon ; for he conies to a conclusion, 
and takes a cQurso, in order to an end, even his ease^ 
or the saving himself from trouble : he seeks something 
futurCi and uses means in order to a future thing, even in 



SECT. V, MAKfi MEN MACHINES. 317 

his drawing up that conchision, that he will seek nothings 
and use no means in order to anything in future ; he seeks 
bis future ease, and the benefit and comfort of indolence. 
If prior neces^sity, that determines all things, makes vain 
all actions or conclusions of ours, in order to anything fu- 
ture ; then it makes vain all conclusions and conduct of 
ours, in order to our future ease. The measure, of our 
ease, with the time, manner, and every circumstance of 
it, is already fixed, by all-determining necessity, as much 
as anything else. If he says within himself, " What fu- 
ture happiness or misery I shall have, is already, in efifect, 
determined by the necessary course and connection of 
things; therefore, I will save myself the trouble of labor and 
diligence, which cannot add to my determined degree of 
happiness, or diminish my misery ; but will take my ease, 
and will enjoy the comfort of sloth and negligence." Such a 
man contradicts himself; he says, the measure of his fu- 
ture happiness and misery is already fixed, and he will , 
not try to diminish the one, nor add to tlie other; but < ^ '., 
yet, in his very conclusion, he contradicts this ; for he ' 
takes up this conclusion, to add to his future happiness, 
by the ease and comfort of his negligence ; and to dimin- 
ish his future trouble and misery, by saving himself the 
trouble of using means and taking pains. 

Therefore, persons cannot reasonably make this im- 
provement of the doctrine of necessity, that they will go 
into a voluntary negligence of means for their own hap- 
piness. For the principles they must go u|)on, in order 
to this, are inconsistent with their making any improve- 
ment at all of the doctrine ; for to make some improve- 
ment of it, is to be influenced by it, to come to some vol- 
untary conclusion, in regard to their own conduct, with

some view or aim ; but this, as has been shown, is jncon- 
sisteDt with the principles thej pretend to act upon. Iq 
short, the principles are such as cannot be acted upon at 
all, or, in any respect, consistently. And, therefore, in 
every pretence of acting upon them, or making any im- 
provement at all of them, there is a self-contradiction. 

As to that objection against the doctrine, which I have 
endeavored to prove, that it makes men no more than mere 
machines ; 1 would say, that notwithstanding this doctrine, 
man is entirely, perfectly, and unspeakably, difierent from 
a mere machine, in that he has reason and understanding, 
and has a faculty of will, and is so capable of volition and 
choice ; and in that his will is guided by the dictates or 
views of his understanding ; and in that his external ac- 
tions and behavior, and in many respects, also bis ttiougbts, 
and the exercises of his mind, are subject to his will ; so 
that he has liberty to act according to his choice, and do 
what be pleases ; and, by means of these thin^s^ is capa- 
ble of moral habits and moral acts, -such inclinations and 
actions, as, according to the common sense of mankind, 
are worthy of praise, esteem, love, and reward; or, on 
the contrary, of disesteem, detestation, indignation, and 
punishment. 

In these things is all the difference from mere machines, 
as to liberty and agency, that would be any perfection, 
dignity, or privilege, in any respect: all the difference 
that can be desired, and all that can be conceived of; and 
indeed all that the pretensions of the Arminians them- 
selves come to, as they are forced often to explain tliem- 
selves. (Though their explications overthrow and abol- 
ish the things asserted, and pretended to be explained.) 
For they are forced to explain a self-determining power of

will, by a power in the soul to determine as it cliooses or 
wills ; which comes to no more than this, that a man has 
a power of choosing, and, in many instances, can do as be 
chooses. Which is quite a different thing from that con- 
tradiction, his having power of choosing his first act of 
choice in the case. 

Or, if their scheme makes any other difference than 
tbb between men and machines, it is for the worse ; it is 
so far from supposing men to have a dignity and privilege 
above machines, that it makes the manner of their being 
determined still more unhappy. Whereas machines are 
guided by an understanding cause, by the skilful hand of 
the workman or owner ; the will of man is left to the 
guidance of nothing but absolute blind contingence. 

SECTION VL 

CONCERNING THAT OBJECTION AGAINST THE DOCTBINE WHICH 
HAS BEEN MAINTAINED, THAT IT AGREES WITH THE STOI- 
CAL DOCTRINE OF FATE, AND THE OPINIONS OF MR. HOBBB8. 

When Calvinists oppose the Arminian notion of the 
freedom of will, and contingence of volition, and insist 
that there are no acts of the will, nor any other events 
whatsoever, but what are attended with some kind of ne- 
cessity ; their opposers cry out of them, as agreeing with 
the ancient Stoics in their doctrine of fate, and with Mr« 
Hobbes in his opinion of necessity. 

It would not be worth while to t9ke notice of so imper- 
tinent an objection, had it not been urged by some of the 
chief Arminian writers. There were many important 
truths maintained by the ancient Greek and Roman phi- 
k)sophers, and especially the Stoics, that are never the

worse for being held by tbem. The Stoic philosophers, 
by the general agreement of Christian divines, and even 
Arminian divines, were the greatest, wisest, and most vir- 
tuous of all the heathen philosophers ; and in their doc- 
trine and practice came the nearest to Christianity of any 
of their sects. How frequently are the sayings of these 
philosophers, in many of the writings and sermons, even 
of Arminian divines, produced, not as arguments of the 
falseness of the doctrines which they delivered, but as a 
con6rmation of some of the greatest truths of the Christian 
religion, relating to the unity and perfections of the God- 
head, a future state, the duty and happiness of mankind, 
etc. as observing how the light of nature and reason, in 
the wisest and best of the heathen, harmonised with and 
confirms the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
' And it is very remarkable, concerning Dr. Whitby, 
that although he alleges the agreement of the Stoics with 
us, wherein he supposes they maintained the like doctrine 
with us, as an argument against the truth of our doctrine ; 
yet this very Dr. Whitby alleges the agreement of the 
Stoics with the Arminians, wherein he supposes they 
taught the same doctrine with them, as an argument for 
the truth of their doctrine.* So that, when the Stoics 
agree with them, this (it seems) is a confirmation of their 
doctrine, and a confutation of ours, as showing that our 
opinions are contrary to the natural sense and common 
reason of mankind : nevertheless, when the Stoics agree 
with us, it argues no -uch thing in our favor ; but, "on the 
contrary; is a great argument against us, and shows our 
doctrine to be heathenish.

SECT. ri. Of THE STOICAL FATE. 321 

It b observed by some CalviDislic writers, that the Ar«> 
minians symbolise with the Stoics in some of those doc- 
trines wherein they are opposed by the Calvinists ; partic- 
ularly in their denying an original, innate, total corruption 
and depravity of heart ; and in what they held of man's 
ability to make himself truly virtuous and conformed to 
God ; and in some other doctrines. 

It may be furtlier observed, it is certainly no better ob- 
jection against our doctrine, that it agrees, in some re- 
spects, with the doctrine of the ancient Stoic philosophers, 
than it is against theirs, wherein they differ from us, that 
it agrees, in some /espects, with the opinion of the very 
worst of the heathen philosophers, the followers of Epicu- 
rus, that father of athebm and licentiousness, and with the 
doctrine of the Sadducees and Jesuits. 

I am not much concerned to know precisely what the 
ancient Stoic philosophers held concerning /ale, in order 
to determine what is truth ; as though it were a sure way 
to be in the right, to take good heed to difier from them. 
It seems that they differed among themselves ; and prob- 
ably the doctrine of /ale, as maintained by most of them, 
was, in some respects, erroneous. But whatever their 
doctrine was, if any of them held such a fate as is repug- 
nant to any liberty, consisting in our doing as we please ; 
I utterly deny such a fate. If they held any such fate as 
is not consistent with the common and universal notions 
that mankind have of liberty, activity, moral agency, vir- 
tue and vice ; I disclaim any such thing, and think I have 
demonstrated that the scheme I maiiitain is no such scheme. 
If the Stoics, by fate meant anything of such a nature a9 
can be supposed to stand in the way of the advantage 
and benefit of the use of means and endeavors, or make

it less worth the while for men to desire and seek after 
anything wherein their virtue and happiness consists ; I 
bold no doctrine that is clogged with any such inconveni- 
ence, any more than any other scheme whatsoever ; and 
by no means so much as the Arminian scheme of contin- 
gence ; as has been shown. If they held any such doc- 
trine of universal fatality as is inconsistent with any kind 
of liberty, that is or can be any perfection, dignity, privi- 
lege, or benefit, or anything desirable, in any respect, 
for any intelligent creature, or indeed with any liberty 
that is possible or conceivable ; I embrace no such doc- 
trine. If they held any such doctrine of fate as is incon- 
sistent with the world's being in all things subject to the 
disposal of an intelligent wise Agent, that presides, not 
as the soul of the world, but as the sovereign Liord of the 
universe, governing all things by proper will, choice, 
and design, in the exercise of the most perfect liberty con- 
ceivable, without subjection to any constraint, or being 
properly under the power or influence of anything before, 
above, or without himself: I wholly renounce any such 
doctrine. 

As to Mr. Hobbes's maintaining the same doctrine con- 
cerning necessity ; I confess it happens I never read Mr. 
Hobbes. Let his opinion be what it will, we need not 
reject all truth which is demonstrated by clear evidence, 
merely because Tt was once held by some bad man. This 
great truth, that Jesus is the Son of God, was not spoil- 
ed because it was once and again proclaimed with a loud 
voice by the devil. .If truth is so defiled, because it is 
spoken by the mouth, or written by the pen, of some ill- 
minded mischievous man, that it must never be received^ 
we shall never know when we hold any of the most pre-

cious and evident truths by a sure tenure. And if Mr. 
Hobbes has made a bad use of this truth, that is to be la- 
mented ; but the truth is not to be thought worthy of re- 
jection on that account. It is common for the corruptions 
of the hearts of evil men to abuse the best things to vile 
purposes. 

I might also take notice of its having been observed, 
that the Arminians agree with Mr. Hobbes^ in many more 
things than the Calvinists ; — as, in what he is said to hold 
concerning original sin, in denying the necessity of super- 
natural illumination, in denying infused grace, in denying 
the doctrine of justiBcation by faith alone ; and other things. 

SECTION VII. 

CONCERNING THE NECESSITY OF THE DIVINE WILL. 

Soke may possibly object against what has been sup- 
posed of the absurdity and inconsistence of a self-deter- 
mining power in the will, and the impossibility of its be- 
ing otherwise than that the will should be determined in 
every case by some motive, and by £( motive which (as 
it stands in the view of the understanding) is of superior 
strength to any appearing on, the other side; that if these 
things are true, it will follow, that not only the will of crea- 
ted minds, but the will of God himself y is necessary in 
all its determinations. Concerning which, says the au- 
thor of the Essay on the Freedom of Will in God and 
in the Creature (pp. 85, 86), " What strange doctrine 
is this, contrary to all our ideas of the dominion of God ? 
does it not destroy the glory of his liberty of choice, and 
take away from the Creator and Governor and Benefac-

3S4 CORCERNINO THE NECESSITY PART IT* 

tor of the world, that most free and sovereign agent, all 
the glory of this sort of freedom ? does it not seem tor 
make him a kind of mechanical medium of fisite, and in* 
troduce Mr. Hobbes's doctrine of fatality and necessity 
into all things that Grod hath to do with ? Does it not 
seem to represent the blessed God as a being of vast an* 
derstandingy as well as power and efficiency, but stili to 
leave him without a will to choose among all the objects 
within his view ? In short, it seems to make the blessed 
God a sort of almighty minister of fate, under its univer- 
sal and supreme influence ; as it was the professed senti- 
ment of some of the ancients, that fate was above the 
gods." 

This is declaiming, rather than arguing ; and an appli- 
cation to men's imaginations and prejudices, rather than 
to mere reason. — But I would calmly endeavor to consider, 
whether there be any reason, in this frightful representa- 
tion. — ^But, before I enter upon a particular consideration 
of the matter, I would observe this : that it is reasonable 
to suppose, it should be much more difficult to express or 
conceive things according to exact metaphysical truth, 
relating to the nature and manner of the existence of things 
in the Divine understanding and will, and the operation 
of these faculties (if I may so call them) of the Divine 
Mind, than in the human mind ; which is infinitely more 
within our view, and nearer to a proportion to the meas- 
ure of our comprehension, and more commensurate to the 
use and import of human speech. Langua'ge is indeed very 
deficient in regard of terms to express precise truth con- 
cerning our own minds, and their faculties and operations. 
Words were first formed to express external things ; and 
those that are applied to express things internal and spiritu-

aly are almost all borrowed, and used in a sort of 6gura* 
tive sense. Whence they are, most of them, * attended 
with a great deal of ambiguity and unfixedness in their 
significatioa, occasioning innumerable doubts, difficuHieSi 
and confusions, in inquiries and controversies about things 
of this nature. But language is much less adapted to ex* 
press things in the mind of the incomprehensible Deity 
precisely as they are. 

We find a great deal of difficulty in conceiving exactly 
of the nature of ogr own souls*. And notwithstanding 
all the progress which has been made, in past and present 
ages, in this kind of knowledge, whereby our metaphysics, 
as it relates to these things, is brought to greater perfec- 
tion than once it was ; yet, here is still work enough left 
for future inquiries and researches, and room for progress 
still to be made, for many ages and generations. But we 
had need to be infinitely able metaphysicians, to conceive 
with clearness, according to strict, proper, and perfect 
truth, concerning the nature of the Divine Essence, and 
the modes of the action and operation of the powers of 
the Divine Mind. 

And it may be noted particularly, that though w€ are 
obliged to conceive of some things in God as consequent 
and dependent on others, and of some things pertaining 
to the Divine nature and will as the foundation of others, 
and so before others in the order of nature : as, we must 
conceive of the knowledge and holiness of God as prior, 
in the order of nature, to his happiness ; the perfection of 
his understanding, as the foundation of his wise purposes 
and decrees ; the holiness of his nature, as the cause and 
reason of his holy determinations. And yet, when we

fundamental and dependent, determining and determined, 
in the first Being, who is self-existent, independent, of 
perfect and absolute simplicity and immutability, and the 
first cause of all things ; doubtless there must be less pro- 
priety in such representations, than when we speak of de- 
rived dependent beings, who are compounded, and liable 
to perpetual mutation and succession. 

Having premised this, I proceed to observe concerning 
the fore-mentioned author's exclamation about the necex* 
iary determination of OocPs will^ in all things^, by what 
he sees to be Jittest and best. 

That all the seeming force of such objections and ex- 
clamations must arise from an imagination that there is 
some sort of privilege or dignity in being without such a 
moral necessity as will make it impossible to do any oth- 
er than always choose what is wisest and best ; as though 
there were some disadvantage, meanness, and subjection, 
in such a necessity ; a thing by which the will was con- 
fined, kept under, and held in servitude by something, 
which, as it were, m: intained a strong and invincible 
power and dominion over it, by bonds that held him fast> 
and that he could by no means deliver himself from. 
Whereas, this must be all mere imagination and delusion. 
It is no disadvantage or dishonor to a being, necessarily to 
act in the most excellent and happy manner, from the ne- 
cessary perfection of his own nature. This argues no im- 
perfection, inferiority, nor dependence, nor any want of 
dignity, privilege or ascendency.* li is not inconsistent 

* << It might have been objected, with more plausibleness, that the 
Supreme Cause cannot be freey because he must needs do alwajrs 
what is best in the whole. But this would not at all serve Spinoza's

with the absolute and most perfect sovereignty of God. 
The sovereignty of God is his ability and authority to do 

Beta and wisdom ; a necetsitj consistent with the greatest freedom 
and most perfect choice. For the only foundation of this necessity 
is such an un^Iter^le rectilade of will, and perfection of wisdom, as. 
makes it impossible for a wise being to act foolishly/' — ClarKeIs 
Demonstration of the Being and Attriimtes of God, Edit 6. p. 64. 

<* Though God is a most perfect free agent, yet he cannot but do 
always what is best and wisest in the whole. The reason is evident ; 
because perfect wisdom and goodness are as steady and certain prin- 
ciples of action as necessity itself; and ^n infinitely wise and good 
Being, endued with the most perfect liberty, can no more choose to 
act in contradiction to wisdom and goodness, than a necessary agent 
can act contrary to the nece^ity by which it is acted ; it being as 
great an absurdity and impossibility in choice, for Infinite Wisdom 
to choose to act unwisely, or Infinite Goodness to choose what is not 
good, as it would be in nature, for absolute necessity to fail of produ- 
cing its necessary efifeci There was, indeed, no necessity in nature, 
that God should at first create such beings as he has created, or in* 
deed any being at all ; because be is, in himself, infinitely happy and 
all-sufficient. There was, also, no necessity in nature, that he should 
preserve and continue things in being, after they were created ; be> 
cause he would be self-sufficient without their continuance, as he was 
before their creation. But it was fit, and wise, and good, that infi- 
nite Wisdom should manifest, and Infinite Goodness communicate 
itself; and therefore it was necessary, in the sense of necessity I 
am now speaking of, that things should be made, alt sneh a UnUy and 
continued go Umg, and indeed with various perfections in such de- 
grees, as Infinite Wisdom and Goodness saw it wisest and best that 
they should."— /^U pp. 112, 113. 

<< It is not a fiiult, but a perfection of our nature, to desire, will, 
and act, according to the last result of a fair examination. This is 
so far from being a restraint or diminution of freedom, that it is the 
very improvement and benefit of it ; it is not an abridgement, it is 
the end and use of our liberty ; and the further we are removed from 
such a determination, the nearer we are to misery and slavery. A 
perfect indiiFemnce in the mind, not determinable by its last judg^ 
ment, of the good or evil that is thought to attend its choice, would 
be so far from being an advantage and excellency of any intellectu- 
al nature, that it would be as great an imperfection as the want of

willa and acta for it. For if he prefera it in bia preaent thoughta he»

tants of the earth ; ond none can $tay his handy or tatf

to the sovereignty of God: viz. (1) supreme, universal, 
and infinite power; whereby he is able to do what be 
pleases, without control, without any confinement of that 
power, without any subjection, in the least measure, to any 
other power ; and so without any hinderance or restraint, 
that it should be either impossible, pr at all difficult, for bim 
to accomplish his will ; and without any dependence of his 
power on any other power, from whence it should be deri- 

alwajs, and eternallj.will, according to his infinite comprehension of 
things ; that is, must will all things that are wisest and best to be 
done. There is no getting free of this conseqaence. If it can will 
at all, it must will this way. To be capable of knowing, and not ca- 
pable of willing, is not to be understood. And to be capable of will- 
ing otherwise than what is wisest and best, contradicts that know- 
ledge which is infinite. Infinite knowledge must direct the will 
without error. Here, then, is the origin of moral necessity y and that 
is really of freedom. Perhaps it may be said, when the Divine will 
is determined, from the consideration of the eternal aptitudes of 
things, it is as necessarily determined as if it were physically impell- 
ed, if that were possible. But it is unskilfolness to suppose this an 
objection. The great principle is once established, vis., that the Di* 
vine will is determined by the eternal reason and aptitudes of things, 
instead of being physically impelled ; and after that, the more strong 
and necessary this determination is, the more perfect the Deity must 
be allowed to be : it is this that makes him an amiable and adorable 
Being, whose will and power are constantly, immutably determined 
by the. consideration of what is wisest and best ; instead of a surd 
Being, with power, but without discerning and reason. It is the 
beauty of this necessity, that it is strong as fate itself with aU the ad- 
vantage of reason and goodness. It is strange to see roeji contend, 
that the Deity is not free, because he is necessarily rational, immu- 
tably good and wise ; when a man is allowed still the perfecler be- 
ing, the more fixedly and constantly his will is determined by reason 
and truth." inquiry into the MUure of the Human Soui, Kd\i. 3,

Tedy or which it should stand in any need of; so far from this, 
that all other power is derived from him, and is absolute* 
ly dependent on liim. (2) That he has supreme auikoritg ; 
absdute and most perfect right to do what be wills, with- 
out subjection (o any superior authority^ or any derivation 
of authority from any other, or limitation by any distinct in- 
dependent authority, either superior, equa), or inferior ; he 
being tiiehead ofall dominion, and fountain of all authority ; 
and also without restraint -by any obligaiion, implying ei- 
ther subjection, derivation, or dependence, or proper limi- 
tation. (3) That his mil is supreme, underived, and in- 
dependent on anything without himself; being in every- 
thing detennined by his own counsel, having no other rule 
but his own wisdom ; his will not being subject to, or re- 
strained by the will of any other, and other wills being per- 
fectly subject to his. (4) That his msdoniy which de- 
termines his will, is supreme, perfect, underived, self-suffi- 
cient, and independent ; so that it may be said, as in Isai- 
ah, xl. 14, With whom took he counsel^ and who instruct- 
ed him^ and taught him in the path of judgmeniy and 
taught him knowledge^ and showed to him the way ofun^ 
derstandingl — There is no other divine sovereignty but 
this ; and this is properly absolute sovereignty : no other 
is desirable ; nor would any other be honorable or hap- 
py ; and, indeed, there is no other conceivable or possi- 
ble. It is the glory and greatness of the Divine Sove- 
reign, that God's will is determined by his own infinite, all- 
sufficient wisdom in everything ; and in nothing at all is 
either directed by any inferior wisdom, or by no wisdom ; 
whereby it would become senseless arbitrariness, deter- 
mining and acting without reason, design, or end. 

If God's will is steadily and surely determined in every 



SBCT. Vlt. AOlte£ABLC TO FEBFECT UBERTT. 331 

thing by supreme wisdom, then it is in everything neces* 
sarily deterniioed to thai which is moit wise. And, cer* 
tainly, it would be a disadvantage and indignity to be 
otherwise. For if the Divine will was not necessarily 
determined to tliat which, in every case, is wisest and 
best, it must be subject to some degree of undesigning 
eontingence ; and so in the same degree liable to evil. 
To suppose the Divine will liable to be carried hither aad 
thither at random, by the uncertain wind of blind coniin* 
gence, which is guided by no wisdom, no motive, no \n* 
telligent dictate whatsoever, (if any such thing were pos* 
sible,) would certainly argue a great degree of imperfec- 
tion and meanness, infinitely unworthy of the Deity. If 
it be a disadvantage for the Divine will to be attended 
with this moral necessity, then the more free from it, and 
the more left at random, the greater dignity and advan- 
tage. And, consequently, to be perfectly free from the 
direction of understanding, and universally and entirely 
left to senseless, unmeaning eontingence, to act absolutely 
at random, would be the supreme glory. 

It no more argues any dependence of God's will, that 
his supremely wise volition is necessary, than it argues a 
dependence of his being, that his existence is necessary^ 
If it be something too low for the Supreme Being to have 
his will determined by moraV necessity, so as necessarily, 
in every case, to will in the highest degree holily and 
happily ; then why is it not also something too low for 
him to have bis existence, and the infinite perfectioQ of 
bis nature, and his infinite happiness, determined by ne* 
oessity ? It is no more to God's dishonor to be necessa*

cessarily to act boiily and wisely. And if it be not dis- 
honorable to be necessarily boly and wise, in the highest 
possible degree, no more is it mean and dishonorable, ne* 
cessarily to act holily and wisely in the highest possible 
degree ; or, which is the same thing, to do that, in every 
case, which, above all other things, is wisest and best. 

The reason why it is not dishonorable to be necessarily 
m»$t holy, is, because holiness in itself is an excellent and 
booorable thing. For the same reason, it is no dishonor 
to be necessarily most wise, and, in every case, to act 
Riost wisely, or do the thing which is the wisest of all ; 
for wisdom is also in itself excellent and honorable. 

The fore-mentioned author of the ** Essay on the Free- 
dom of Will," etc. as has been observed, represents that 
doctrine of the Divine will's being in everything neces- 
sarily determined by superior fitness, as making the bles- 
sed God a kind of almighty minister and mechanical me- 
dium of fate ; and he insists, (pp. 93, 94,) that this mor* 
al necessity and impossibility is in effect, the same thing 
with physical and natural necessity and impossibility ; and 
in pp. 54, 55, he says, '* The scheme which determines 
the will always and certainly by the understanding,'and 
the understanding by the appearance of things, seems to 
take away the true nature of vice and virtue. For the 
sublimest of virtues, and the vilest of vices, seem rather 
to be matters of fate and necessity, flowing naturally and 
necessarily from the existence, the circumstances, and 
present situatioo of persons and things ; for this existence 
and situation necessarily makes such an appearance to the 
mind ; from tiiis appearance flows a necessary perception 
and judgment concerning these things ; this judgment ne- 
cessarily detertnines the will ; and thus, by this chain of 



SICCT. Til. NO MBANNESS OR DISADFANTAOC. 838 

necessary causes^ virtue and vice would lose their nature, 
and become natural ideas, and necessary things, instead of 
moral and free actions.^' 

And yet this same author allows, (pp. 30, 31,) that a 
perfectly wise being will constantly and certainly choose 
wliat is most fit ; and says, pp. 102, 103, " I grant, and 
always have granted, that wheresoever there is such an- 
tecedent superior fitness of things, God acts according to 
it, so as never to contradict it ; and, particularly, in all 
his judicial proceedings as a governor, and distributer of 
rewards and punishments." Yea, he says expressly, (p. 
42,) ** That it is not possible for God to act otherwise 
than according to this fitness and goodness in things." 

So that, according to this author, putting these several 
passages of this essay together, there is tto virtucy nor 
anything of a moral nature ^ in the most sublime and glori* 
ous acts and exercises of God's holiness, justice, and faith-* 
fulness; and be never does anything which is in itself 
supremely worthy, and, above all other things, fit and ex* 
cellent, but only as a kind of mechanical medium of fate ; 
and in what he does as the judge and moral governor of 
the toorldy he exercises no moral excellency, exercising 
no freedom in these things, because he acts by moral ne* 
cessity, which is, in efifect, the same with physical or nat- 
ural necessity ; and therefore he only acts by an Hobbis- 
lical fatality ; as a being indeed of vast understanding, 
as well as power and efficiency (as he said before), but 
without a win to choose, being a kind of almighty min* 
ister of fate, acting under its supreme influence. For 
be allows, that in all these things, God's will is determin- 
ed constantly and certainly by a superior fitness, and (bar 
it is not [>ossible for him to act otherwise. And if these 



834 NECBSSItT or «0D*S acting wisely. TAJBLt IV* 

things are so, what glory or praise belongs to God for do- 
ing holily and justly^ or taking the roost fit, ho]y> wise, 
and excellent course, in any one instance? Whereas, 
according to the Scriptures, and also the common sense 
of mankind, it does not, in the least, derogate from the 
honor of any being, ihat through the moral perfection of 
his nature he necessarily acts with supreme wisdom and 
holiness ; but, on the contrary, his praise is the greater ; 
herein consists the height of his glory. 

The same author (p. 56, ) supposes that herein ap^ 
pears the excellent character of a wise and good many 
thai though he can choose contrary to the fitness of 
thingSy yet he does not ; but suffers himself to be dire^ed 
by fitness; and that, in this conduct, he imitates the Mes- 
sed Ood. And yet, he supposes it is contrariwise with 
the blessed God ; not that he suffers himself to be direct- 
ed by fitness, when he can choose^ contrary to the fitness 
of things f but that he cannot choose contrary to the fitness 
of things; as he says, (p. 42) that it is not possible for 
Ood to act otherwise than according to this fitness^ where 
there is any fitness or goodness in things. Yea, he 
supposes, (p. 31) that if a man were perfectly wise and 
good^ he could not do otherwise than be constantly and 
certainly determined by the fitness of things. 

One thing more I would observe, before I conclude 
this section ; and that is, that if it derogates nothing from 
the glory of God to be necessarily determined by superior 
fitness in some things, then neither does it to be thus de-- 
termined in all things ; from anything in the nature of 
such necessity, as at all detracting from God's freedom, 
independence, absolute supremacy, or any dignity or glo- 
ry of his nature, «tate, or manner of acting ; or as imply- 



8BCT. Til. NECBSSITT OF OOD^fl TOL1TION9. 335 

ing any infirmity, restraint, or subjection. And if the 
thing be such as well consists with God's glory, and has 
nothing tending at all to detract from it ; then we need 
not be afraid of ascribing it to God in too many things, 
lest thereby we should detract from God's glory too much. 

SECTION vm. 

80HB FUETHER OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE MORAL NECESSITY 
OF god's VOLITIONS CONSIDERED. 

The author last cited, as has been observed, owns that 
God; being perfectly wise, will constantly and certainly 
cboose what appears most fit, where there is a superiw 
fitness and goodness in things ; and that it is not possible 
for him to do otherwise. So that it is in eiSfect confessed, 
that in those Uiings where there is any real preferableness, 
it is DO dishonor, nothing in any respect unworthy of God, 
for him to act from necessity : notwithstanding all that 
can be objected from the agreement of such h necessity 
with the fate of (he Stoics, and the necessity maintained 
by Mr. Hobbes. From which it will follow, that if it 
were so, that in all the different things among which God 
chooses, there were evermore a superior fitness or prefer- 
ableness on one side, then it would be no dishonor, or 
anything, in any respect, unworthy or unbecoming of 
God, for his will to be necessarily determined in every 
thing. And if this be allowed, it is a giving up entirely 
the argument, from the unsuitableness of such a necessity 
to the liberty, supremacy, independence, and glory of the 
Divine Being ; and a resting the whole weight of the af* 
lair on the decision of another point wholly diverse,^ viz. 
whether it be to indeed^ that in all the various possible 



\ 



336 NSCE99ITT OF COP's YOLITIONS. TAMT ir« 

things which are in God's view, and may be considered 
as capable objects of bis choice^ there is not evermore a 
preferableness in one thing above another. This b denied 
by this author, who supposes that, in many instances, be* 
tween two or more possible things which come witlun 
the view of the Divine mind, there is a perfect indiffer- 
ence and equality, as to fitness or tendency, to attain any 
good end which God can have in view, or to answer any 
of his designs. Now, therefore, I would consider wheth- 
er this be evident. 

The arguments brought to prove this are of two kinds. 
(1) It is urged, that, in many instances, we must suppose 
there is absolutely no difference between various possible 
objects of choice, which God has in view : and, (2) that 
the difference between many things is so inconsiderable, 
or of such a nature, that it would be unreasonable to sup- 
pose it to be of any consequence, or to suppose that any 
of God's wise designs would not be answered in one way 
as well as the other. Therefore, 

1. The first thing to be considered is, whether there 
are any instances wherein there is a perfect likeness, and 
absolutely no difference between diflS^rent objects of 
choice, that are proposed to the Divine understanding? 

And here, in the^r«^ place, it may be worthy to be 
considered, whether the contradiction there is in the terms 
of the question proposed, does not give reason to suspect^ 
that there is an inconsistence in tbe^Ain^ supposed. It 
is inquired, whether different objects of choice may not 
be absolutely without difference J If they are absolutely 
mthcut difference^ then how are they different objects of 
choice ? If there be absolutely no difference^ in any rei 
spect, then there is no variety or distinction ; for distinc* 



SI&CT* ¥IU. OF eOD'9 CEBATINe TBE WOBLP, ETC. 337 

tioD is only bjr some difierence. And if there be no 
varieiy aniong proposed obftcts ofckoic^y then there is no* 
op^portunity for variety of choiccj or difference of vdeter-^ 
mioation. For that deleriniiiation . of a thing, which if. 
not different in any respect, is not a different detennina- 
tioiiy but the same» That this is no quibble^ may appear 
more fully anon. 

Tlie arguments to prove that the Most High, in some 
instances, chooses to do one thing rather than another, 
where the things themselves are perfectly without differ- 
ence, are two. 

1. That the various parts of infinite time and space^ 
absolutely considered, are perfectly alike,, and do not differ 
at a4i one from another; and that therefore, when God 
determined to create the world in such a part of in- 
finite duration and space, rather than others, he determined 
and preferred, among various objects, between which there 
was no preferableness, and absolutely no difference. 

Answ. Tiiis objection supposes an infinite length of 
time before the world was created, distinguished by suc- 
cessive parts, properly and truly so'; or a succession of* 
limited and unmeasurable periods of time, following one 
another, in an infinitely long series : which must needs be 
a groundless inruigination. The eternal duration which- 
was before the world, being only the eternity of God*s 
existence; which is nothing else but his immediate, 
perfect, and invariable possession of the whole of his un* 
limited life, together and at once ; mi<B interminabilis^ totu^ 
nmulet perfecta possessio. Which is so generally allow- 
ed, that I need not to stand to demonstrate it.* 

* *< If all created beiDgs were taken away, all poasibility of axijR

So, this objection supposes an extent of sp^ce beyood 
the limits of the creation, of an inOnite length, breadth, 
and depth, truly and properly distinguisl)ed into differ^ic 
measurable parts, limited at certain stages, one beyond 
another, in an infinite series. Which notion of absolute 

and infinite space is doubtless as unreasonable as that now

mutation or succession of one thing to another, would appear to be 
also removed. Abstract succession in eternity is scarce to be under- 
stood. What is it that succeeds ? One minute to another, perhaps, 
wdvt unda supervenU undmm* But when we imaigine this, we faaey 
that the minutes are things separately existing. This is tlie common 
notion ; and yet it is a manifest prejudice. Time is nothing but the 
existence of created successive beings, and eternity the necessary 
existence of the Deity. Therefore, if this necessary 0eing hath no 
change or succession in his nature, his esistenee must of course be 
unsuccessive. We seem to commit a double oversight in this case ; 
firstf we find succession in the necessary nature and existence of the 
Deity himself; which is wrong, if the reasoning above be conclusiTe. 
And then we ascribe this succession to eternity, considered abstraet- 
edly from the Eternal Being ; and suppose it, one knows not what, 
a thing subsisting by itself, and flowing one minute after another. 
This is the work of pure imagination, and contrary to the reality of 
things. Hence the common metaphorical expressions : Time runs 
m^acBy let vs lay lu/ld on ike present mtnvte, and the like. The phir 
losophers themselves mislead us by their illustration. They compare 
eternity to the motion of a point running on for ever, and making a 
traceless infinite line. Here the point is supposed a thing actually 
subsisting, representing the present minute ; and then they ascribe 
motion or succession to it : that is, they ascrilie motion to a mere non- 
entity, to illustrate to us a successive eternity, made up of finite suc> 
eessive parts. — If once we allow an all-perfect Mind, which hath an 
eternal immutable, and infinite comprehension of all things always, 
(and allow it we miist),^ the distinction of past and future vanishes 
with respect to such a Mind. In a word, if we proceed step by step, 
fts above, the eternity or existence of the Deity will appear to be 
wUtB interminabitis, tota, simul etperfecta possessio; how much soever 
this may have been a parodox hitherto." — Inquiry into the MUurt tf

meDtioned of absolute and infinite duration. It is as im- 
proper to imagine that the immensity and omnipresence 
of God is distinguished by a series of miles and leagues, 
one beyond another, as that the infinite duration of God 
is distinguished by months and years, one after another* 
A diversity and order of distinct parts, limited by certain 
periods, is as conceivable, and does as naturally dbtrude 
itself on our imagination, in one case as the other: and 
there is equal reason in each case, to suppose that our 
imagination deceives us. It is equally improper to talk 
of months and years of the Divine existence, and mile- 
squares of Deity : and we equally deceive ourselves whea 
we talk of the world's being difierenily fixed, with respect 
to either of these sorts of measures. I think we know 
ttot what we mean, if we say, the world might have been 
differently placed from what it is, in the broad expanse of 
infinity ; or, that it might have been diflferently fixed in 
the long line of eternity : and all arguments and objec« 
tions, which are built on the imaginations we are apt to 
have of infinite extension or duration, are bQildings foun- 
ded on siiadows, or castles in the air. 

II. The second argument to prove that the Most High 
wills otie thing rather than another, without any superior 
fitness or preferableness in the thing preferred, is God's 
actually placing in different parts of the world particles or 
Qtoms of matter that are perfectly equal and alike. The 
fore-mentioned author says, p. 78, etc. " If one would 
descend to th^ minute specific particles of which difiler'* 
ent |)odies are composed, we should see abundant reason 
to believe that there arjs tbousjinds of such little particles, 
or atoms of matter which are perfectly equal and alike, 
and could give no distinct determination to the will of 



S40 OF god's flacing diffbrentlt vart nr* 

God where to place tfaero." He there insMooes in p«^ 
tieles of water, of which there are such inimense nuin* 
bers, which compose the rivers and oceans of this world : 
ftnd the infinite mjriads of the luroinoiis and fiery parti* 
des which compose the body of the sun, so many, that 
it woold be very unreasonable to suppose no two of them 
should be exactly equal and alike. 

Answ. (1) To this I answer: that as we must sup- 
pose matter to be infinitely divisible, it is very unKkely 
that liny two of a}l th^se particles are exactly equal and 
alike ; so unlikely, that it is a thousand to one, yea, an 
infinite number to one, but it is otherwise : and that al- 
though we should alk>w a great similarity between tbe 
di&rent particles of water and fire, as to their genend 
natwre and figure ; and, however small we suppose those 
particles to be, it is infinitely unlUcely that any two of them 
should be exactly equal in dimensions and quantity of 
matter. — If we should suppose a great many globes of 
the same nature with the globe of the earth, it would be 
very strange if there were any two of them that bad ex* 
actly the same number of particles of dust and water in 
them. But infinitely less strange than that two particles of 
light should have just the same quantity of matt^lr. For 
a particle of light according to tbe doctrine of the infinite 
divisibility of matter, is composed of infinitely more as- 
rignable parts than there are particles of dust and water in 
the globe of the earth. And as it is infinitely unlikely that 
any two of these partk^les should be ^fual ; so it is, that 
they should be uKJce in other respects : to instance in the 
configuration of their surfaces. If there were very ma- 
ny globes, of the nature of the earth, it would be very un*- 
likdy that any two should have exactly the same num- 



9BCT. VIII. . SIMILAR PARTieLCS. 341 

ber of particles of dost, water, and stone, \n their surfaces^ 
and all posited exactly alike, one with respect to aD0tber> 
without anj diffisrenco, in aoy part discernible either by 
the naked eye or microscope ; bat infinitely less strange 
than that two particles of light sliould be perfectly of the 
same figure. For, there are infinitely more assignable real 
parts on the surface of a particle of light, than there are 
particles of dust, water, and stone, on the surface of the 
IterKStrial globe. 

Answ. (2) But then, supposing that there are two 
particles, or atoins of matter, perfectly equal and alike, 
which God has placed in different parts of the creation ; 
as I will not deny it to be possible for God to make two 
bodies perfectly alike, and put them in different places; « 
yet it will not follow, that two different or distinct acts tMT 
edicts of the Divine power have exactly the same fitness 
for the same ends. For these two different bodies lire 
not difierent or distinct, in any other respects than thos^ * 
wherein they differ; they are two in" no other respects 
dian those wherein there is a di&rence. If they are per- 
fectly e<}ual and alike in themselves^ then they can be dis^ 
tmguished, or be distinct, only in those things which are 
called circumstances ; as place, time, rest, motion, or some 
other present or past circumstances or relations. For it 
is diflference onlv that constitutes dislmction. If God 
makes two bodies in themselves every way equal and 
alike, afnd agreeing perfectly in all other circumstances 
and relations but only their place ; then in this only is 
there any. distinction or duplicity; The. figure is the same) 
the measure is the same, the solidity and resistance aire 
ibe same, and- everything the same but only the place. 
Therefore what the will of Gcki determines is ibis, name^

it be the pleasure of God to cause the sane resbtance and 
the same figure to be in two different places and sttoationa^ 
we can no more justly argue from it, liiat here must be 
aome determination or act of God's wilt that, ia wholly 
without motive or end, than we can argue, diat whenever, 
in any case, it is a man's will to speak the same words^ 
or make the same sounds, at two difierent times, there 
must be some determination or act of his will, withoiil 
any motive or end. The difierenoe of place, in the ibr* 
mer case, proves no more tl»n the difierenoe of ttme does 
in the other. If any one should say, with negard to the 
former case, that there must foe something determined 
without an end ; viz. that of those two similar bodies, this 
id particular should be made in this place, and tlie other 
tb the other, and should inquire why the Creator did not 
make them in a transposition, when footh are alike, and eitdi 
would equally have spited either place ? The inquiry 
Supposes something thai is not true ; namely, that the 
two bodies difller and are distinct in other respects besides 
their place. So that, with this distinction inherent io 
them,' they might in their . first creation, have been traoa^ 
posed, and each might have begun its existence in the 
llhce of the other. 

Let us for clearness' sake, suppose tliat God.liad>«t

spheres are different in no other respect but th^ir place ^

hats the same roundness; it is not a distinct rotundity, .in

mericalfy they differ. Thus the roundness of one is not 
the same nufnerical^ individual roundness with that of 
the other." Let this be supposed; then the question 
about the determination of the Divine will in the affair, is, 
why did God will that this individual roundness should 
be at the right hand, and the other individual roundness 
at the left? why did not he make them in a contrary po- 
sition ? Let any rational person consider, whether such 
questions be not words without a meaning ; as much as if 
God should see fit, for some ends, to cause the same 
sounds to be repeated, or made at two different times ; 
the sounds being perfectly the same in every other res- 
pect, but only one was a minute after the other ; and it 
should be asked, upon it, why God caused these sounds, 
numercially different, to succeed one the other in such a 
manner? Why he did not make that individual sound, 
which was in the first mintite, to be in the second 7 and 
the individual sound of the last minute to be in the first : 
which inquiries, would bo even ridiculous ; as I think every 
person must see, , at once, in the case proposed of two 
sounds, being only the same repeated, absolutely without 
any difference, but that one circumstance of time. If the 
Most High sees it will answer some good end, that the 
same sound should be made by lightning at two distinct 
times, and therefore wills titat it should be so, must it needs 
therefore be, that herein there is some act of God's will 
without any motive or end? God saw fit often, at dis- 
tinct times, and on different occasions, to say the very 
same words to Moses ; namely, those, / am Jehovah, 
And would it not be unreasonable to infer, as a certain 
consequence, from this,, that here must be some act or acts 
of the Divine will, in determiniag and disposing these' 



S»CT« nil. AND TBIN08 Of TRIVtAL DlVPEftEWCE. 345 



wprds exactly alikei at different tiiiM», wholly without 
tticn or inducemeDt ? But it would be no more unreason- 
able, than to say, that there must be an act of God's with* 
out any inducement, if he sees it best, and, for some rea^^ 
sons, determines that there shall be the same resistance, 
the same dimensions, and the same figure, in several dis- 
tinct places. 

If, in the instance of the two sphered perfectly alike, it 
be supposed possible that God might have made them in 
a contrary position'; t[»it which is made at the right Imnd, 
being made at the left ; then I ask, whether it is not evi- 
dently equally possible, if God had made but one of them, 
and'that in the place of the right*hand globe, that he might 
have made that numerically difierent from what is, and 
numerically different from what he did make it ; though 
perfectly alike, and in the same place ; and at the same 
time, and in every respect, in the same circumstances and 
relatione ? Namely, whether he might not have made it 
numerically the same with that which he has now made 
at the left hand ; and so have left that which is now crea* 
t^ at the right hand in a state of non-existence ? And 
if so, whether it would not have been possible to have 
made one in that place, perfectly like these, and yet nu* 
noerically differing from both ? And let it be considered, 
whether, from this notion of a numerical difference in 
bodhss perfectly equal and alike, which numerical differ- 
ence is something inherent in the bodies themselves, and 
diverse from the difierence of place or time, or any cir- 
cumstance whatsoever ; it will not follow, that there is an 
ia6nite number of numerically di&rent possible bodies, 
perfectly alike, among which God ebooees, by a seU-ik^* 
terraining power, when he goes about to create bodies.

Therefore let us put the case thus: supposiag that 
God in the begiooing bad created but one perfectly solid 
sphere, in a certain place ; and it should be inquired, Why 
God created that individual sphere, in that place, at that 
time ? And why he did not create another sphere per- 
fectly like it, but numerically different, in the same place, 
at the same time ? Or why he chose to bring into being 
there that rery body, mther than any of the infinite num- 
ber of other bodies perfectly like it ; either of which he 
could have made there as well, and would liave answered 
his end as well ? Why he caused to exist, at that place 
and time, that individual roundness, rather than any other 
of the infinite number of individual rotundities just like it ? 
Why that individual resistance, rather than any other of 
the infinite number of possible resistances just like it ? 
And it might as reasonably be asked, Why, when God 
first caused it to thunder, be caused that individual sound 
then to be made, and not another just like it ? Why did 
he make choice of this very sound, and reject all the infi- 
nite number of other possible sounds just like it, but nu-^ 
merically differing from it, and all differing one from ano- 
ther? I think every body must be sensible of the absur* 
dity and nonsense of what is supposed in such inquiries. 
And if we calmly attend to the matter, we shall be con- 
vineed, that all such kind of objections as I am answering, 
are founded on nothing but the imperfection of our man^ 
ner of conceiving things, and the obscureness of language, 
and great want of clearness and precision in the significa- 
tion of terms. 

If any shall find iault with this reasoning, that it is go- 
ing a great length into metaphysical niceties and subtil- 
ties ; I answer : the objection which they are in reply to, 



8ECT» VIII. NECESSITT CONSISTENT, ETC. 34T 

is a metapbysical subtilty, and must be treated according 
to the nature of it.* 

II. Another thing alleged is, that innumerable things 
which are determined by the Divine will, and chosen and 
done by God, rather than others, differ from those that 
are not chosen, in so inconsiderable a manner, that it would 
be unreasonable to suppose the difference to be of any 
consequence, or that there is any superior fitness or good- 
ness that God can have respect to in the determination. 

To which I answer : it is impossible for us to deter- 
mine, with any certainty or evidence, that because the 
di&rence is very small, and appeara to us of no consider- 
ation, therefore there is absolutely no superior goodness, 
and no valuable end, which can be proposed by the Crea- 
tor and Governor of the world, in ordering such a differ- 
ence. The fore-mentioned author mentions many instan- 
ces. One is, there being one atom in the whole universe 
more or less. But I think it would be unreasonable to 
suppose, that God made one atom in vain, or without any 
end or motive. He made not one atom but \\hat was a 
work of his almighty power, as much as the whole globe 
of the earth, and requires as much of a constant exertion 
of almighty power to uphold it ; and was made and is up- 
held understandingly, and on design, as much as if no 
other had been made but that. And it would be as un- 
reasonable to suppose titat he made it without anything 
really aimed at in ^o doing, as much as to suppose, that 
he made the planet Jupiter without aim or design.

It 13 possiUe that the most minute effects of the Crea* 
tor's power, the smallest assignable difieceoee between 
the things which God has made, may be attended, in the 
whole series of events, and the whole compass and extent 
of their inBuenee, with very great and important ccmse** 
quences. If the laws of motion tad gravitation laid down 
by Sir Isaac Newton bold universally^ there is not one 
atom, nor the least assignable part of an atom, but what 
has influence, every moment, thK>ugfaout the whole ma«- 
terial universe, to cause every part to .be otherwise than 
it would be, if it were qot fiur that partieokir corporeal 
exbtence. And however the effect is insensible for the 
fwesentf yet it amy, in length of time, become great and 
important. 

To illustrate this, let us suppose two bodies moving the 
same way, in straight lines, perfectly parallel one to anoth- 
er ; but to be diverted from this parallel course, and drawn 
one from another, as much as might be by the attraction 
of an atom, at the distance of one of the furthest of the 
fixed stars from the earth ; these bodies being turned out 
of the lines of their parallel motfon, will, by degrees, gel 
further and further distant one from the other ; and though 
the distance may be imperceptible for a long time, yet at 
length it may become very great. So, the involution of 
a planet round the sun being retarded or accelerated, and 
the orbit of its revolution made greater or less, and more 
or less elliptical, and so its periodical time longer or short* 
er, no more than may be by the influence of the least 
atom, might, in length of time, perform a whole revoki* 
tioQ soooet or later than otherwise it would have done ; 
Vhich miglit make a vast alteration with regard to m\U 
lions of important events. So, the influence of the leastf 



8SCT. Till. WITH FREE GRACE. 849 

particle may, for ought we know, have such effect on 
something in the constitution of some human body, as 
to cause another thought to arise in the mind at a certain 
time, tlian otherwise would have been ; which, ith length 
of time (yea, and that not very great), might occasion a 
vast alteration through the whole world of mankind; And 
so innumerable other ways might be mentioned^ wherein 
the least assignable alteration may possibly be attended 
with great consequences. 

Another argument y which the fore-mentioned author 
brings against a necessary determination of the Divine will, 
by a superior fitness, is, that such doctrine derogates from 
the freeness of God's grace and goodness, in choosing 
the objects of his favor and bounty, and from the oft- 
ligation ui)on men to thankfulness for special benefits. 
Page 89, etc. 

In ans ver to this objection, I would observe : 

I. That it deros^ates no more from the goodness of God 
to suppose the exercise of the benevolence of his nature 
to be determined by wisdom, than to suppose it determin- 
ed by chance, and that bis favoi*s are bestowed altogether 
at random, his will being determined by nothing but per* 
feet accident, without any end or design whatsoever; 
which must be the case, as has been demonstrated, if vo- 
lition be not determined by a prevailing motive. That 
which is owing to perfect conlingence, wherein neither 
previous inducement nor antecedent choice has any hand, 
is not owing more to goodness or benevolence, than that 
which is owing to the influence of a wise end. 

2. It is acknowledged, that if the motive that deter- 
mines the will of God in the choice of the objects of his 

fiivors, be any moral quality in the object, recommending 

30 



360 HECESSITT CONSISTKNT PART IT, 

that object to Ins benevolence above otbers, his choosing 
that object is not so great a manifestation of the freeness 
and sovereignty of his grace, as if it were otherwise. But 
there is no necessity of supposing this, in order to our 
supposing tbat he has some wise end in view, in deter* 
mining to bestow his favors on one person rather than 
another. We are to distinguish between the merit of 
the object of God* 8 favor ^ or a moral qualification of the 
object attracting tbat favor and recommending to it, aad 
the natural fitness of sucb a determination of the ad of 
Oo(fs goodness, to answer some wise design of his own, 
some end in the view of GodVomniscience. It is God's 
own act that is the proper and immediate object of his 
volition. 

3. 1 suppose that none will deny, but that, in some in- 
stances, God acts from wise design in determining the 
particular subjects of his favors : none will say, I presume, 
that when God distinguishes, by his bounty, particular 
societies or persons,, lie never, in any instance, exercises 
any wisdom in so doing, aiming at some happy conse- 
quence. And, if it be not denied to be so in some in- 
stances, then 1 would inquire, whether, in these instances, 
God's goodness is less manifested than in those wherein 
God has no aim or end at all ? and whether the subjects 
have less cause of thankfulness ? And if so, who shall 
be thankful for the bestowment of distinguishing mercy, 
with that enhancing circumstance of the distinctions be- 
ing made without an end ? How shall it be known when 
God is influenced by some wise aim^ and when not ? It 
is very manifest, with respect to the apostle Paul, that 
God had wise ends in choosing him to be a Christian and 
m apostle, who had been a persecutor, etc. The apos- 



S£CT. Vtll. WITH FREE GRACE. 351 

tie himself mentions one end. 1 Tim, i. 15^ 16: ^* Christ 
Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I 
am chief. Howbeit, for this caase 1 obtained mercy, that 
in roe first, Jesus Christ might show forth all long sufibr- 
ing, for a pattern to them who should hereafter believe on 
him to life everlasting." But yet the apostle never look- 
ed on it as a diminution of the freedom and riches of Di- 
vine grace in his election, which he so often and so great** 
ly magnifies. This brings me to observe : 

4. Our supposing such a moral necessity in the acts of 
God's will as has been spoken of, is so far from necessari- 
ly derogating from the riches of God's grace to such 
as are tlie chosen objects of his favor, that in many ita^ 
stances this moral necessity may arise from goodness, and 
from tlie great degree of it. God may choose this objeict 
tether than another, as having a superior fitness to answer 
the ends, designs, and inclinations, of his goodness ; be- 
ing more sinful, and so more miserable and necessitous 
than others, the inclinations of Infinite Mercy and Benevo- 
lence may be more gratified, and the gracious design of 
God's sending his Sbn into the world, may be more abuR- 
dantly answered, in the exekt^ises of mercy towards such 
an object, rather than another. 

One thing more I would observe, before I finish what 
I ^lave to say on the head of the necessity of the acts of 
God's will ; and that is, that something much more like 
a servile subjection of the Divine Being to fatal necessity, 
will follow from Arminian principles than from the doc- 
trines which they oppose. For they (at least most of 
them) suppose, with respect to all events that happen in 
the moral world, depending on the volitions of moral agents, 
which are the most important events of the universe, to 



358 or ABICINIAM rATALITT. FABT IT. 

which all others are subordinate ; I say, they suppose, with 
respect to these, that God has a certain foreknowledge of 
them, antecedent to any purposes or decrees of his about 
them. And if so, they have a fixed certain futurity, prior 
to any designs or volitions of his, and independent oo 
them, and to which his volitions roust be subject, as he 
would wisely accommodate his affairs to this fixed futurity 
of the state of things in the moral world. So that here, 
instead of a moral necessity of God's will, arising from, 
or consisting in, the infinite perfection and blessedness of 
the Divine Being, we have a fixed, unalterable state of 
things, properly distinct from the perfect nature of the 
Divine Mind, ahd the state of the Divine will and de- 
sign, and entirely independent on these things, and which 
they have no hand in, because they are prior to them ; 
and which God's will is truly subject to, being obliged to 
conform or accommodate himself to it, in all his purposes 
and decrees, and in everything be does in his disposals 
and government of the world ; the moral world being the 
end of the natural ; so that all is in vain, that is not ac* 
commodated to that state of the moral world, which con- 
sists in, or depends upon, the acts and state of the wills 
of moral agents, which had a fixed futurition from eter- 
nity. Such a subjection to necessity as this, would truly 
argue an inferiority and servitude, that would be unworthy 
of the Supreme Being ; and is much more agreeable to 
the notion which many of the heathen had of fate, as 
above the gods, than that moral necessity of fitness and 
wisdom which has been spoken of; and is truly repug* 
nant to the absolute sovereignty of God, and inconsistent 
with the supremacy of bis will ; and really subjects the 
will of the Most High to the will of his creatures, and 
brings him into dependence u{)on them. 



SECT. IX. or THE OBJECTION, ETC. ' 353 

SECTION DL 

CONCERNING THAT OBJECTION AGAINST THE DOCTRINE WHICH 
HAS BEEN MAINTAINED, THAT IT MAKES GOD THE AUTBOft 
OF SIN. 

It is urged by Arininians, that the doctrine of the ne- 
cessity of men's volitions, or their necessary connection 
with antecedent events and circumstances, makes the First 
Cause, and Supreme Ord erer of all things, the author of 
sin ; in that he has so constituted the state and course of 
things, that sinful volitions become necessary, in conse- 
quence of his disposal. Dr. Whitby, in his "Discourse 
on the Freedom of the Will,"* cites one of the ancients 
as ou his side, declaring that this opinion of the necessity 
of the will " absolves sinners, as doing nothing of their 
own accord which was evil, and would cast all the blame 
of all the wickedness committed in the world upon God, 
and upon his providence, if that were admitted by the as- 
sertors of this fate ; whether he himself did necessitate 
them to do these things, or ordered matters so that they 
should be constrained to do them by some other cause." 
And the doctor says, in another place,f " In the nature 
of the thing, and in tlie opinion of philosophers, causa de» 
JicienSy in rebus necessariis^ ad causam per se effidentem 
redacenda est — in things necessary, the de6cient cause 
must be reduced to the efficient. And in this case the 
reason is evident ; because the not doing what is required, 
or not avoiding what is forbidden, being a defect, must

30* 



S54 or THE OBJECTION ABOUT PART IT* 

ibllow from the position of the oecessarj cause of that de- 
ficiency." 

Concerning this, 1 would observe the following things : 

1. If there be any difficulty in this matter, it is nothing 
peculiar to this scheme ; it b no difficuhy or disadvantage, 
wherein it is distinguished from the scheme of Arminians ; 
and, therefore, not reasonably objected by thera/ 

Dr. Whitby supposes, that if sin necessarily follows 
from God's withholding assistance, or if that assistance be 
not given, which is absolutely necessary to the avoiding 
of evil ; then, in the nature of the thing, God must be as 
properly the author of that evil, as if he were the efficient 
cause of it. From whence, according to what he himself 
says of the devils and damned spirits, God must be the 
proper author of their perfect unrestrained wickedness : 
he must be the efficient cause of the great > pride of the 
devils, and of their perfect malignity agaiust God, Christ, 
his sa'nts, and all that i<; good, and of the insatiable cruelty 
of their disposition. For he allows, that God has so for* 
saken them, and does so withhold his assistance from thera, 
that they are incapacitated from doing good, and deter- 
mined cinly to evil.* Our doctrine, in its consequence, 
makes God the author of men's sin in this world, no more, 
and in no other sense, than his doctrine, in its consequence, 
makes God the author of the hellish pride and nialice of 
the devils. And doubtless the latter is as odious an effect 
as the former. 

Again, if it will follow at all, that God is the author of 
sin, from what has been supposed of a sure and infallible 
connection between antecedents and consequents, it will 

* On Uie Five Pointe, pp. 302, 305. 



SECT. IX. MAKING GOD THE AUTHOR OV SIK. ' 355 

follow because of this, viz. that for God to be the author. 
or orderer of those things which he knows beforehand will 
infallibly be attended with such a consequence, is the 
same thing, in effect, as for him to be the author of that 
consequence. But if this be so, this is a difficulty which 
equally attends the doctrine of Arminians themselves ; at 
least, of those of them who allow God's certain foreknow* 
lege, of all events. For, on the supposition of such a fore** 
knowledge, this is the case with respect to every sin that 
is committed : God knew, that if he ordered and brought 
to pass such » and such events, such sins would infallibly 
follow. As, for instance, God certainly foreknew, long 
before Judas was born, that if he ordered things so, that 
there should be such a man born, at such a time and at 
such a place, and that his life should be preserved, and 
that he should, in Divine providence, be led into acquain- 
tance with Jesus ; and that his heart should be so influ* 
enced by God's Spirit qv providence, as to be inclined to 
be a follower of Christ ; and tiiat he slrould be one of 
those twelve, which should be chosen constantly to attend 
him as his family ; and that his liealth should be preserv- 
ed, so that he should go up to Jerusalem, at the last pass- 
over in Christ's life ; and it should be so ordered, that 
Judas should see Christ's kind treatment of the woman 
which anointed him at Bethaay, and have that reproof 
from Christ which he had at that time, and see and hear 
other things which excited his enmity against his Master, 
and other circumstances should be ordered as they were 
ordered ; it would be what would most certainly and infal- 
libly follow, tliat Judas would betray his Lord, and would 
soon after hang himself, and die impenitent, and be sen| 
to hell for his horrid wickedness. 



366 HOW OOD IS CORCSRNKO PART IT. 

Therelbre, this supposed difficulty ought not to be 
brought as an objection against the scheme which bas 
been maintainedyas diiogreeing with the Anntnian scheme, 
seeing it is no difficulty owing to such a Usqgreement ; 
but a difficulty wherein the Arminians share with us* 
That must be unreasonably made an objection against oor 
differing from them, which we should not escape or arad 
at all by agreeing with them. 

And therefore I wouM observe : 

U. They who object, that this doctrine makes God 
the author of sin, ought d'istinctly to explain what they 
mean by that phrase, the auikar of sin. I know tho 
phrase, as it is commonly used, signi6es something very 
ill. If by the tmthor of itit, be meant the nnneVf the 
agent J or etctor of ein^ or the doer of a tcicked thing; 
so it would be a reproach and blasphemy to suppose 
God to be the author of sin. In this sense, I utterly de- 
ny God to be the author of Hb ; rejecting such an im- 
putation on the Most High, as what is inGnitely to be 
abhorred ; and deny any such thing to be the conse- 
quence of what 1 have laid down. But if, by the author 
ofeiuy is meant the permitter, or not a hinderer of sin ; 
and at the same time, a disposer of the state of events, in 
such a manner, for wise, holy, and most excellent ends 
and purposes, that sin, if it be permitted or not hindered,^ 
will most certainly and infallibly follow : I say, if this be 
all that is meant, by being the author of sin, I do not de- 
ny that God is the author of sin (though I dislike and re- 
ject the phrase, as that which by use and custom is apt 
to carry another sense) ; it is no reproach for the Most 
High to be thus the author of sin. This is not to be tbe 
actor of fin, but, on the contrary, of holiness. What 



SMBCT. IX. IK Ttt£ fiXlSTEKCB OF StN. 857 

God doth berein is holy, and a glorious exercise of the in- 
finite excellency of his nature. And I do not deny, that 
God's being thus the author of sin follows from what I 
have laid down ; and 1 assert, that it equally follows from 
the doctrine which is maintained by most of the Arminian 
divines. 

That it is most certainly so, that God is in such a man* 
ner the disposer and orderer of sin, is evident, if any credit 
is to be given to the Scripture ; as well as because it is im- 
possible, in the nature of things, to be otherwise. In such 
a manner God ordered the obstinacy of Pharaoh, in his 
refusing to obey God's commands, to let the people go. 
Exod. iv. 21 : '^ t will harden his heart, and he shall 
not let the people go." Chap. vii. 2 — 5 : " Aaron thy 
brother shajl speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the chil- 
dren of Israel out of his land. And I will harden Phara- 
oh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the 
land of Egypt. But Pffkraoh shall not hearken unto 
you ; that I may lay mine hand upon Egypt, by great 
judgments," etc. Chap. ix. 12 : " And the Lord hard- 
ened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto 
them, as the Lord had spoken unto Moses." Chap, x. 
1,2: ^'And th^ Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto 
Pharaoh; for Ihave hardened his heart, and the heart 
of his servants, that I might show these my signs before 
him ; and that thou mayest tell it in the ears of thy son^ 
tind thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, 
and my signs which I have done amongst them ; that ye 
may know that I am the Lord." Chap. xiv. 4 : " And 
I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after 
them : and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all 
bis host." Verse 8 : " And the Lord hardened the heart 



358 HOW GOD 18 CONCBSNEB . PART IT. 

of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the chil- 
dren of Israel." And it is certain that, in such a manner, 
God for wise and good ends, ordered that event, Joseph's 
being sold into Egypt by his brethren. Gen. xlv. 5 : 
*' Now, therefore, be not grieved, nor angry with your* 
selves, that ye sold roe hither; for God did send me be-^ 
fore you to preserve life.'* Ver. 7,8: " God did 
send me before you to preserve a posterity in the earth, 
and to save your lives by a great deliverance : so that 
now it was not you that sent me hither, but God." Ps. 
cvii. 17 : " He sent a man before them, even Joseph, 
who was sold for a servant." It is certain that thus God 
ordered the sin and folly of Sihon king of the Amorites, 
in refusing to let the people of Israel pass by hini peace- 
ably. Deut. ii. 30 : ^' But Sihon king of Heshbon would 
not let us pass by him ; for the Lord thy God hardened 
his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might de- 
liver him into thine hand." It is certain, that God thus 
ordered the sin and folly of the kings of Canaan, that they 
attempted not to make peace with Israel, but, with a stu* 
pid boldness and obstinacy, set themselves violently to 
oppose them and their God. Josh. xi. 20 : " For it was 
of the Lord, to harden their hearts, that they should 
come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them 
utterly, and that they might have no favor ; but that 
he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Mo- 
ses." It is evident that thus God ordered the treach- 
erous rebellion of Zedekiah against the king of Baby- 
lon. Jer. liii. 3 : " For through the anger of the Lord 
it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast 
them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled 
against the king of Babylon." So, 2 Kings, xxiv. 20. 



SECT. IX. IN THE EXISTENCE OF SIN. 359 

And it is exceeding manifesty that God thus ordered the 
rapine and unrighteous ravages of Nebuchadnezzar^ in 
spoiling and ruining the nations round about. Jer. xxv. 
9 : '* Beholdy I will send and take all the families of the 
north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadnezzar my servant, 
and will bring them against this land, and against all the 
nations round about ; and will utterly destroy them, and 
make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual 
desolations/' Chap, xliii. 10,11: '^I will send and 
take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant ; 
and I will set his throne upon these stones that I have 
hid, and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.. 
And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, 
and deliver such as are for death to death, and such as are 
for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword, to 
the sword." Thus God represents himself as sending 
for Nebuchadnezzar, and taking of him and his armies^ 
and bringing him against the nations which were to be 
destroyed by him, to that very end, that he might utterly 
destroy them, and make them desolate ; and as appoint- 
ing the work that he should do, so particularly, that the 
very persons were designed that he should kill with the 
sword, and those that should be killed with famine and 
pestilence, and those that, should be carried into captivi- 
ty ; and that in doing all these things he should act as his 
servant ; by which, less cannot be intended, than that be 
should serve his purposes and designs. And in Jer. 
3^xvii. 4 — 6, God declares how he would cause him thus 
to serve his designs, viz*, by bringing this to passJn his 
sovereign disposals, as the great Possessor and Governor 
of the universe, that disposes all things just as pleases 
him. ^' Thus. saith the Liord of Hosts, the God of Isra- 



360 HOW GOD 18 CONCERNED PART IV. 

el ; I have made the earth, the man and the beast that 
are upon the ground, by my great power, and by my 
out-stretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seem- 
ed meet unto me. And now I have given all these landa 
into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, mv servant ; and the 
beasts of the field have I given also to serve him." And 
Nebuchadnezzar is spoken of as doing these things, by 
having his arms strengthened by God, and having God's 
iUfOrd put into his handsyfor this end. Ezek. xxx. 24 
^26. Yea, God speaks of his terribly ravaging and 
wasting the nations, and cruelly destroying all sorts, with- 
out distinction of sex or age, as the weapon in God's 
band, and the instrument of his indignation, which God 
makes use of to fulfil his own purposes, and execute his 
own vengeance. Jer. li. 20, etc. *' Thou art my battle- 
axe and weapons of war: for with thee will 1 break id 
pieces the nations; and wiih thee I will destroy king- 
doms; and with thee I will break in pieces the horse 
and his rider ; and with thee 1 will break in pieces the 
chariot and his rider ; with thee also will I break in 
pieces man and woman ; and with thee will 1 break io 
pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in 
pieces the young man and the maid," etc. It is repre- 
sented, that the designs of Nebuchadnezzar, and those 
that destroyed Jerusalem, never could have been accom- 
plished, had not God determined them as well as they, 
Lam. iii. 37 : '* Who is be that saith, and it cometh to 
pass, and the Lord commandeth it not ?" And yet the 
king of Babylon's thus destroying the nations, and espe- 
cially the Jews, is spoken of as his great wickedness, for 
which God finally destroyed him. Isa. xiv. 4, 5, 6, 12. 
Hab. ii. 5 — 12, and Jer, 1. and li. It is most^manifesti 



SBCT. IX. IN TBB fiS.I8TENC£ 01* SIN. 361 

that God, to serve bis own designs, provideDtiaJly order* 
ed Shimei's cursing David. 2 Sam. xvi. 10, 11 : '^ The 
Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. — ^Let him curse: 
for the Lord hath bidden him." 

It is certain, that God thus, for excellent, holy, gra- 
cious and glorious ends, ordered the fact which they 
committed who were concerned in Christ's death.; and 
that therein they did but fulfil God's designs. As, I trust, 
no Christian will deny it was the design of God, that 
Christ should be cnidfied, and that for this end he cama 
into the world. It is very manifest, by many Scriptures, 
that the whole affair of Christ's crucifixion, with its cir- 
cumstances, and the treachery of Judas, that made way 
for it, was ordered in God's providence, in pursuance of 
his purpose ; notwithstanding the violence that is used 
with those plain Scriptures, to obscure and pervert the 
sense of them. Acts ii. 23 : "Him, being delivered by 
the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,* ye 
ha\'e taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain." 
Luke x«ii. 21, 22:t "But, behold, the hand of him 
that betrayeth me is with me on the table. And truly

t ''As this passage is not liable to the ambiguities which some

upon it as an evident proof, that those things are, in the language of 
Scripture, said to be determined or decreed (or exactly bounded an4

whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pi- 
late, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were 
gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy 
counsel determined before to be done." Acts iii. 17, 18 : 
^' And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye 
did it, as did also your rulers. But those things, which 
God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, 
that Christ should suffer, he hath so fuI61Ied." So that 
what these murderers of Christ did, is spoken of as what 
God brought to pass, or ordered, and that by which he 
fulfilled his own word. 

In Rev. xvii. 17, the agreeing of the Icings of the 
earth to give their kingdom to the beast, though it was 
a very wicked thing in them, is spoken of as a fulfilling 
Ood^s mil, and what God had put into their hearts to 
do. It is manifest, that God sometimes permits sin to be 
committed, and at the same time orders things so, that if 
he permits the fact, it will come to pass, because, on some 
accounts, he sees it needful and of importance that it 
should come to pass. Matt, xviii. 7 : "It must needs *be 
that offences come ; but wo to that man by whom the 
offence cometh." With 1 Cor. xi. 19: "For there 
must also be heresies among you, that they which are 
approved may be made manifest among you." 

Thus it is certain and demonstrable, from the holy 
Scriptures, as well as the nature of things, and the prin- 
ciples of Arminians, that God permits sin ; and, at the 
same time, so orders things in his providence, that it cer- 
tafnly and infallibly will come to pass, in consequence of 
his permission. 



S£CT. IX. IN THE EXISTENCE OF SIN. 363 

I proceed to observe in the next place : 

III. That there is a great difference between God's 
being concerned thus, by his permissioHf in an event and 
act, which, in the inherent subject and agent of it, is sin, 
(though the event will certainly follow on his permission), 
and his being concerned in it by produ(Ang it and exert- 
ing the act of sin ; or between his being the orderer of 
its certain existence, by not hindering it, under certain 
circumstances, and his being the proper actor or author 
of it, by a positive agency or efficiency. And this, not- 
withstanding what Dr. Whitby offers about' a saying of 
philosophers, that causa dejiciensy in rebiLs necessariisy 
ad causam per se efficientem reducenda est. As there is 
a vast difference between the sun's being the cause of the 
lightsomeness and warmth of the atmosphere, and bright- 
ness of gold and diamonds, by its presence and positive 
influence ; and its being the occasion of darkness and 
frost in the night, by its motion, whereby it descends be- 
low the horizon. The motion of the sun is the occasion 
of the latter kind of events ; but it is not the proper cause, 
efficient, or producer of them ; though they are necessa- 
rily consequent on that motion under such circumstances : 
no more is any action of the Divine Being the cause of 
the evil of men's wills. If the sun were the proper cause 
of cold and darkness, it would be the fountain of these 
things, as it is the fountain of light and heat ; arid then 
something might be argued from the nature of cold and 
darkness, to a likeness of nature in the sun ; and it might 
be justly inferred, that the sun itself is dark and cold, and 
that his beams are black and frosty. But from its being 
the cause no otherwise than by its departure, no such 
thing can be inferred, but the contrary : it may justly be 






S64 HOW GOD IS CONCERNED PART lY. 

argued, that the sun is a bright and hot body, if cold and 
darkness are found to be the consequence of its withdraw- 
ment ; and the more constantly and necessarily these 
effects are connected with and confined to its absence, the 
more strongly does it argue the sun to be the fountain of 
light and beat. So, inasmuch as sin is not the fruit of 
any positive agency or influence of the Most High, buf^ 
on the contrary, arises from the withholding of his action 
and energy, and, under certain circumstances, necessarily 
follows on the want of his influence ; this is no argument 
that he is sinful, or his operation evil, or has anything of 
the nature of evil ; but on the contrary, that he, and b]$ 
agency, are altogether good and holy, and that be is the 
fountain of all holiness. It would be strange arguing, in- 
deed, because men never commit sin, but only when God 
leaves them to ikefn$ehes, and necessarily sin when he 
does so, that therefore their sin is not from themselves, 
but from God ; and so that God must be a sinful being : 
as strange as it would b^ to argue, because it is always 
dark when the sun is gone, and never dark when the sud 
is present, that therefore all darkness is from the sun, and 
that his disc and beams must needs be black. 

IV. It properly belongs to the supreme and absolute 
Governor of the universe to order all important events 
within his dominion by bis wisdom : but the events in 
the moral world are of the most important kind ; such 
as the moral actions of intelligent creatures, and their 
consequences. 

These events will be ordered by something. They 
will either be disposed by wisdom, or they will be dis- 
posed by chance ; that is, they will be disposed by blind 
and undesigning causes, if that were possible, and could 



SeCT. IX. IN THE EXISTENCE OF SIN. 965 

be called a disposal. Is it not better that the good and 
evil which happen in God's world, should be ordered, 
regulated, bounded, and determined, by the good pleas- 
ure of an infinitely wise Being, — who perfectly compre- 
hends within his understanding and constant view the 
universality of things, in all their extent and duration, and 
sees all the influence of every event, with respect to every 
individual thing and circumstance throughout the grand 
system, and the whole of the eternal series of consequen- 
ces, — than to leave these things to fall out by chance, 
and to be determined by those causes which h^ve no un- 
derstanding or aim ? Doubtless, in these important events 
there is a better and a woi*se, as to the time, subject, place, 
manner, and circumstances of their coming to pass, with 
regard to their influence on the state and course of things. 

And if there be, it is certainly best that they should 
be determined to that time, place, etc. which is best. 
And therefore it is in its own nature fit, that wisdom, and 
not chance, should order these things. So that it belongs 
to the Being who is the Possessor of infinite wisdom, and 
is the Creator and Owner of the whole system of crea- 
ted existences, and has the care of all ; I say it belongs 
to him to take care of this matter ; and he Would not do 
what is proper for him if he should neglect it. And it 
is so far from being unholy in him to undertake this aflaii^, 
that it would rather have been unholy to neglect it : as 
it would have been a neglecting what fitly appertains to 
him ; and so it would have been a very unfit and unsuita- 
ble neglect. 

Therefore the sovereignty of God doubtless extends 
to this matter ; especially considering, that if it should be 
supposed to be otherwise, and God should leave men's 

31* 



366 HOW GOD IS CONCEBlfEDi ETC. PART IT. 

voIitioDSy and all moral evettts, to the determination and 
disposition of blind unmeaning causes, or they should be 
left to happen perfectly without a cause ; this would be no 
more consistent with liberty, in any notion of it, and par* 
ticularly not in the Arminian notion of it, than if these 
events were subject to the disposal of Divine Providence, 
and the will of man were determined by circumstances 
which are ordered and disposed by Divine wisdom, as 
appears by what has been already observed. But it is 
evident, that such a providential disposing and determia- 
ing men's moral actions, though it infers a moral necessi- 
ty of those actions, yet it does not in the least infringe the 
real liberty of mankind ; the only liberty that common 
sense teaches to be necessary to moral agency, which, as 
has been demonstrated, is not inconsistent with such ne- 
cessity. 

On the whole it is manifest, that God may be, in the 
manner which has been described, the orderer and dispo- 
ser of that event, which, in the inherent subject and agent 
IS moral evil ; and yet bis so doing may be no moral evil. 
He may will the disposal of such an event, and its com* 
ing to pass, for good ends, and his will not be an immoral 
or sinful will, but a perfectly holy will. And he may 
actually, in his providence, so dispose and permit things, 
that the event may be certainly and infallibly connect- 
ed with such disposal and permission, and his act therein 
not be an immoral or unholy, but a perfectly holy act. Sin 
may be an evil thing ; and yet that there should be such 
a disposal and permission as that it should come to pass, 
may be a good thing. This is no contradiction or incon- 
sistence. Joseph's brethren selling him into Egypt, con- 
sider it only as it was acted by them, and with, respect 



8CCT. IX. god's secret AND REVEALED WILL. 367 

to their views and aims, which were evil, was a very bad 
thing ; but it was a good thing, as it was an event of God's 
ordering, and considered with respect to his views and 
aimSj which were good. Gen. 1. 20. " As for you, ye 
thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good." 
So the crucifixion of Christ, if we consider only those 
things which belong to the event as it proceeded from his 
murderers, and are comprehended within the compass of 
the afiair considered as their act, their principles, dispo- 
sitions, views, and aims ; so it was one of the most hein- 
ous things that ever was done, in many respects the most 
horrid of all acts : but consider it as it was willed and 
ordered of God, In the ei^tent of his designs and views, 
it was the most admirable and glorious of all events ; and 
God's willing the event was the most holy volition of 
.God that ever was made known to men ; and God's act 
in ordering it was a divine act, which, above all others, 
manifests the moral excellency of the Divine Being. 

The consideration of these things may help us to a suf- 
ficient answer to the cavils of Arminians, concerning what 
has been supposed by many Calvinists, of a distinction, 
between a secret and revealed will of God, and their di- 
versity one from the other; supposing that the Calvinists 
herein ascribe inconsistent wills to the Most High : which 
is without any foundation. God's secret and revealed 
will, or, in other words, his disposing and perceptive will, 
may be diverse, and exercised in dissimilar acts, the one 
in disapproving and opposing, the other in willing and de- 
termining, without any inconsistence. Because, although 
these dissimilar exercises of the Divine will may, in some 
respects, relate' to the same things, yet, in strictness, they 
have dififerent and contrary objects, the one evil, and the 



368 OF god's secret part iv. 

other good. Thus, for instance, the crucifixion of Christ 
was a thing contrary to the revealed or perceptive will of 
God ; because, as it was viewed and done by his malig- 
nant murderers, it was a thing infinitely contrary to the 
holy nature of God, and so necessarily contrary to the holy 
inclination of his heart, revealed in his law. Yet this 
does not at all hinder but that the crucifixion of Christ, 
considered with all those glorious consequences which 
were within the view of the Divine Omniscience, might 
be indeed, and therefore might appear to God to be, a 
glorious event ; and consequently be agreeable to his wilh 
though this will may be secret, t. e. not revealed in God's 
law. And thus considered, the crucifixion of Christ was 
not evil, but good. If the secret exercises of God's will 
were of 'a kind that is dissimilar, and contrary to his re- 
vealed will respecting the same or like objects ; if the ob-^ 
jects of both were good, or both evil ; then, indeed, to 
ascribe contrary kinds of volition or inclination Jo God 
respecting these objects, would be to ascribe an inconsis- 
tent will to God : but to ascribe to him different and op- 
posite exercises of heart respecting different objects, and 
objects contrary one to another, is so far from supposing 
God's will to be inconsistent with itself, that it cannot be 
supposed consistent with itself any other way. For any 
being to have a will of choice respecting good, and, at the 
same time, a will of rejection and refusal respecting evil, 
is to be very consistent: but the contrary, viz. to have 
the same will towards these contrary objects, and to choose 
and love both good and evil at the same time, is to be ve- 
ry inconsistent. 

There is no inconsistence in supposing, that God niay 
hate a thing as it is in itself, and considered simply as evil. 



SECT. IX. AND RSVEALED WILL. 369 

and yet that it may be bis will it should come to pass, 
considering all consequences. I believe there is no per- 
son of good understanding, who will venture to say, he is 
certain that it is impossible it should be best, takii\g in the 
whole compass and extent of existence, and all consequen- 
ces in the eudless series of events, that there should be 
such a thing as moral evil in the world.* And if so, it 

* Here are worthy to be observed some passages of a lale noted 
writer, of our nation, that nobody who is acqaainted with, will suspect . 
to be very favorable to Calvinism. " It is difficult," says he, " to '"'v 
handle the necessity of eml in such a manner as not to stumble such 
as are not above being alarmed at propositions which have an uncom* 
mon sound. But if philosophers will but reflect calmly on the mat- 
ter, they will find,Xhat, consistently with the unlimited power of the 
Supreme Cause, it may be said, that in the best-ordered system, evUs 
must have place.*' — Tuknbull's Principles of Moral Philosophy^ pp. 
387, 328. He is there speaking of moral evils, as may be seen. 

Again, the same author, in his second volume, entitled << Christian 
Philosophy," p. 35, has thiese words : « If the Author and Governor 
of all things be infinitely perfect f then whatever is, is right; of all 
possible systems he hath chosen the best ; and consequently there ig 
no absolute evil in the universe. This being the case, all the seeming 
imperfecticniis or emls in it are such only in ^partial view ; and, with 
respect to the whole system, they are goods.** 

• " fTAence, then, comes evil ? is the question that hath, in all ages, 
been reckoned the Gordian knot in philosophy. And indeed, if we 
own the existence of evil in the world in an absolute sense, we dia- 
metrically contradict what hath been just now proved of God. For if 
there be any evU in the system, that is not good wKh respect to the 
toholcy then is the whole not good, but evil, or, at best, very imperfect : 
and an author must be as his workmanship Is ; as is the effect, such 
is the cause. But the solution of this difficulty is at hand ; thai there 
is no evil in the universe. What ! are there no pains, no imperfec- 
tions ? Is there no misery, no vice, in the world ? or, are not these 
evils f Evils indeed they are ( that is, those of one sort are hurtful, 
and those of the other sort are equally hurtful and abominable : but 
they are not evil or mischievous with respeot to the whole.** — Ibid* 
p. 37. 



dllO OF OOd'a SBCRttt PARTtV. 

will certainly follow, that an infinitely wise Being who al- 
ways chooses what is best, must choose that there should 
be such a thing. And if so, then such a choice is not an 
evil, but a wise and holy choice. And if so, then that 
providence which is agreeable to such a choice, is a wise 
and holy providence. Men do unll sin as sin, and so are 
the authors and actors of it: they love it as sin, and for 
evil ends and purposes. God does not will sin as sin, or 
for the sake of anything evil ; though it be his pleasure 
so to order things, that, he permitting, sin will come to 
pass ; for the sake of the great good that by his disposal 
shall be the consequence. His willing to order things so 
that evil should come to pass, for the sake of the contrary 
good, is no argument that he does not hate evil as evil : 
and if so, then it is no reason why he may not reasonably 
forbid evil as evil, and punish it as such. 

The Arminians themselves must be obliged, whether 
they willor no, to allow a distinction of God's will, amount- 
ing to just the same thing that Calvinists intend by their 
distinction of a secret and revealed will. They must al- 
low a distinction of those things which God thinks best 



** Bat He is, at the Bame time, said to create evil, darkness, confu- 
sion ; and yet to do no evil, but to be the Author of good only. He

tempteth no man y but giveth to all nun liber tdlyj and upbraideth not. 
And yet, by the prophet Isaiah, He is introduced saying of himself, /

Lord do all these tilings. What is the meaning, the plain language of 
all this, but that the Lord delighteth in goodness, and (as the Scrip- 
ture speaks) evil is his strange work f He intends and pursues the 
universal good of his creation : and the evil which happens, is not 
permitted for its own sake, or through any pleasure in evil, but be- 
pause it is requisite to the greater good pursued." — Ibid, p. 42.

SECT. IX. AND REVEALED WILL. 371 

should be, considering all circumstances and consequences, 
and so are agreeable to his disposing will, and those things 
which he loves, and are agreeable to his nature, in them- 
selves considered. Who is there that will dare to say, that 
the hellish pride, malice, and cruelty of devils, are agree- 
able to God, and what he likes and approves ? And yet, 
I trust, there is no Christian divine but what will allow, 
that it is agreeable to God's will so to order and dispose 
things concerning them, so to leave them to themselves, 
and give them up to thejr own wickedness, that this perfect 
wickedness should be a necessary consequence. Be sure 
Dr. Whitby's words do plainly suppose and allow it.* 

These following things may be laid down as maxims of 
plain truth, and indisputable evidence. 

1. That God is a perfectly happy being, in the most 
absolute and highest sense possible. 

2. That it will follow from hence, that God is free 
from everything that is contrary to happiness ; and so, 
that in strict propriety of speech, there is no such thing as 
any pain, grief, or trouble in God. 

3. When any intelligent being is really crossed and dis- 
appointed, and things are contrary to what he truly de- 
sires, he is the hss pjleased, or has less pleasure, his pleas' 
ure and happiness is diminished, and he suffers what is 
disagreeable to him, or is the subject of something that is 
of a nature contrary to joy and happiness, even pain and 
grief.f 

* Whitby on the Five Points, edit. 2. pp. 300, 305, 309. 

t Certainly it is not less absurd and unreasonable to talk of God's 
will and desires being truly and properly crossed, without his suffer- 
ing any uneasiness, or anything grievous or disagreeable, than it is 
.to talk of something that may be called a revealed will, which may, 
in some respect, be different from a secret purpose ; which purpose 
may be fulfilled, when the other is opposed. 



378 or god's sbcrct part. it. 

From this lastaxioin it follows, that if no distioctioa is 
to be adpiitted between Crod's hatred of sin, and his will 
with respect to the event and the existence of sin, as tbe 
all-wise Determiner of all events, under tbe view of all 
consequences through the whole compass and series of 
things; I say, then, it certainly follows, that the coming 
to pass of every individual act of sin is truly, all things 
considered, contrary to his will, and that his will is really 
crossed in it ; and this in proportion as he bates it. And 
as God's hatred of sin is infinite, by reason of the infinite 
contrariety of his holy nature to sin ; so his will is infinite- 
ly crossed in every act of sin that happens. Which is as 
much as to say : He endures that which is infinitely disa* 
greeable to him, by means of every act of sin that he sees 
committed. And therefore, as appears by the preceding 
positions, be endures truly and really infinite grief or pain 
from every sin. And so he must be infinitely crossed, 
and suffer infinite pain every day, in millions of millions of 
instances : be must continually be the subject of an im- 
mense number of real and truly infinitely great crosses 
and vexations. Which would be to make him infinitely 
the most miserable of all beings. 

If any objector should say : All that these things amount 
to is, that Ood may do evil that good may come, which 
is justly esteemed immoral and sinful in men ; and there- 
fere may be justly esteemed inconsistent with the moral 
perfections of God. I answer: that for God to dispose 
and permit evil, in the manner that has been spoken of, is 
not to do evil that good may come ; for it is not to do 
evil at all. In order to a thing's being morally evil, there 
iQust be one of these things belonging to it : either it must 
be a^thing unjit and unsuitable in its own nature ; or it 



SECT. IX. AND REVEALED WILL. 373 

must have a bad tendency ; or it must -proceed from an 
evil dispositiony and be done for an evil end. But nei- 
ther of these things can be attributed to God's ordering 
and permitting such events, as the immoral acts of crea- 
tures, for good ends. (1) It is not tinjit in its own na--^ 
ture, that he should do so. For it is in its own nature 
Jit, that infinite wisdom, and not blind chance, should 
dispose moral good and evil in the world. And it is fit, 
that the Being who has infinite wisdom, and is the Maker, 
Owner, and supreme Governor of the world, should take 
care of that matter. And therefore there is no unfitness 
or unsuitableness in his doing it. It may be unfit, and so 
immoral, for any other beings to go about to order this 
affair ; because they are not possessed of a wisdom, that in 
any manner fits them for it ; and, in other respects, they 
are not fit to be trusted with this affair ; nor does it belong 
to them, they not being the owners and lords of the uni- 
verse. 

We need not be afraid to affirm, that if a wise and good 
man knew with absolute certainty, it would be best, all 
things considered, that there should be such a thing as 
moral evil in the world, it would not be contrary to his 
wisdom and goodness, for him to choose that it should be 
so. It is no evil desire to desire good, and to desire that 
which, all things considered, is best. And it is no unwise 
choice, to choose that that should be, which it is best 
should be ; and to choose the existence of that thing con- 
cerning which this is known, viz. that it is best it should 
be, and so is known in the whole to be most worthy to be 
chosen. On the contrary, it would be a plain defect in wis- 
dom and goodness, for him not to choose it. And the 
reason why he might not order it, if he were able, would 

32 - 



874 god's secret and revealed will, part ir« 

not be because he might not desire it, but only the order* 
iog of that matter does not belong to htm. But it is do 
barm for him who is, by right, and in the greatest propri- 
ety, the supreme Orderer ofall things, to order every thiog 
in such a manner, as it would be a point of wisdom in him 
to choose that they should be ordered. If it would be a 
plain defect of wisdom and goodness in a being, qot to 
choose that that should be, which he certainly knows it 
would, all things considered, be best should be (as was 
but now observed), then it niust be impossible for a being 
who has no defect of wisdom and goodness, to do other- 
wise than choose it should be ; and that for this very rea- 
son, because he is perfectly wise and good. And if it be 
agreeable to perfect Wisddtn and Goodness for hitn to 
choose that it should be, and the ordering of. all things 
supremely and perfectly belongs to him, it must be agree- 
able to infinite Wisdom and Goodness to order that it 
shoqld be. If the choice is good, the ordering and dis- 
posing things according to that choice must also be good. 
It can be no harm in one to whom it belongs to do his 
will in the armies of heaven, and amongst the inhabit 
tants of the earthy to execute a good volition. If this 
will be good, and the object of his will be, all things con- 
sidered, good and best, then the choosing or willing it, is 
not willing evil that good may come. And, if so, then 
his ordering according to that will, is not doing evil that 
good may come. 

2. It is not of a bad tendency, for the Supreme Being 
thus to order and permit that moral evil to be, which it is 
best should come to pass. For that it is of good tenden- 
cy i is the very thing supposed in the point now in ques- 
tion. Christ's crucifixion, though a most horrid fact in 



sficT. X. OF sin's first bntrancEi etc. 375 

them that perpetrated it, was of a most glorious tendency 
as pernf]iued and ordered of God. 

3. Nor is there any need of supposing it proceeds from 
any evil disposition or aim ; for by the supposition, what 
is aimed at is good, and good is the actual issue, in the 
final result of things. 

SECTION X. 

CONCERNING SIN^S FIRST ENTRANCB INTO THE WORLD. 

The things which have ah-eady been offered may servd 
to obviate or clear many of the objections which might 
be raised concerning sin's first coming into the world ; as 
though it would follow from the docliine maintained, that 
God mu?l be the author of the first sin, through his so 
disposing things, that it should necessarily follow from his 
permission, that the sinful act should be committed, etc* 
I need not, therefore, stand to i*epeat what has been said 
already about such a necessity's not proving God to be 
the author of sin, in any ill sense, or in any such sense as 
to infringe any liberty of man, concerned in his moral 
agency, or capacity of blame, guilt, and punishment* 

Bui, if it should nevertheless be said, supposing the 
case so, (hat God, when he had made man, might so or« 
der his circumstances, that, from these circumstances, to- 
gether with his withholding further assistance and Divine 
influence. Iiis sin would infallibly follow, why might not 
God as well have first made man with a fixed prevailing 
principle of sin in his heart ? 

I answer, 1. It was meei, if sin did come into exis* 
tence, and appear in the world, it should arise from the 
imperfection which properly belongs to a creature, as such, 



376 OF bin's first entrance part fY. 

and should appear so to do, that it might appear not to 
be from God as the' efficient or fountain. But this could 
not have been, if roan bad been made at first with siii in 
bis heart ; nor unless the abiding principle and habit of 
sin were first introduced by an evil act of the creature. 
If sin had not arose from the imperfection of the creature, 
it would not have been so visible, that it did not arise 
from God, as the positive cause, and real source of it. — 
But it would require room that cannot be here allowed, 
fully to consider all the difficulties which have been start- 
ed concerning the first entrance of sin into the world. 

And therefore, 

2. I would observe, that objections against the doc* 
trine that has been laid down, in opposition to the Arminian 
notion of liberty, from these difficulties, are altogether 
impertinent; because no additional difficulty is incur*' 
red by adhering to a scheme in this manner difiering front 
theirs, and none would be removed or avoided by agree* 
ing with, and maintaining, theirs. Nothing that the Ar- 
minians say about the contingence, or self-determining 
power of man's will, can serve to explain, with less diffi- 
culty, how the first sinful volition of mankind could take 
place, and man be justly charged with the blame of it. 
To say, the will was self-determined, or determined hy 
free choice, in that sinful volition ; which is to say, that 
the first sinful volition was determined by a foregoing sin-* 
ful volition ; is no solution of the difficulty. It is an odd 
way of solving difficulties, to advance greater, in order 
to it. To say two and two make nine ; or, that a child 
begat his father, solves no difficulty : no more does it, to 
say, the first sinful act of choice was before the first sin- 
ful act of choice, and chose and determined it, and 



a d 

SECT. XI. INTO THE WORLD. 377 

brought it to pass. Nor is it any better solution, to 
say, the firat sinful volition chose, determined, and pro- 
duced itself; \N hich is to say, it was before it was. Nor, 
will it go any furtlier towards helping us over the dif* 
ficulty, to say, the first sinful voliiion arose accidentally, 
without any cause 9i all ; any more thisn ii will solve that- 
difficult question, Sow the world could be made out of 
nothing 1 to say, it came into being out of nothing, with- 
out any cause ; as has been already observed. And if 
we should allow that that could be, that the first evil vo- 
lition should arise by perfect accident, without any cause] 
it would relieve no difficulty, about God's laying the 
blame of it to man. For how was man to blame for per- 
fect accident, which had no cause, and which, therefore, 
he (to be sure) was not the cause of, any more than if it 
came by some external cause ? — Such kind of solutions 
are no belter, than if some person, going about to solve 
some of the strange mathetnatical paradoxes about infi'* 
nitely great and small quantities ; as, that some infinitely 
great quantities are innnilely greater 4han some other infi- 
nitely great quantities; and also that some infinitely small 
quantities are infinitely less than others, which yet are 
infinitely tittle ; in order to n solution, should say, that 
mankind have been under a mistake, in supposing a great- 
er quantity to exceed a smaller ; and that a hundred mul- 
tiplied by ten makes but a single unit.

sufficient to answer most of the objections, and silence

378/ or THE cWjectioK faat iv* 

the great exclamations of Arminians against the Calvin- 
ists, from the supposed inconsistence of Calvinistic pria- 
ciples with the moral perfections of God, as exercised in 
his government of mankind. The consistence of such 
a doctrine of necessity as has been maintained, with the 
fitness and reasonableness of God's commands, promises, 
and threatenings, rewards and punishments, has been par* 
ticularly considered : the cavils of our opponents, as though 
our doctrine of necessity made Gud the author of sin, 
have been answered ; and also their objection against these 
principles, as inconsistent with God's sincerity in his coun- 
sels, invitations, and persuasions, has been already obvia- 
ted, in what has been observed respecting the consistence 
of what Calvinists suppose concerning the secret and re- 
vealed will of God: by that it appears, there is no repug- 
nance in supposing it may be the secret will of God, that 
his ordination and permission of events should be such, 
that it shall be a certain consequence, that a thing never 
will come to pass ; which yet it is man's duty to do, and 
so God's perceptive will that he should do; and this is 
the same thing as to say, God may sincerely command 
and require him to do it. And if he may be sincere in 
commanding him, he may, for the same reason, be sin- 
cere in counselling, inviting, and using persuasions with 
him to do it. Counsels and invitations are manifestations 
of God's perceptive will, or of what God loves, and what 
is in itself, and as man's act, agreeable to his heart ; and 
not of his disposing will, and what he chooses as a part 
of his own infinite scheme of things. It has been particu- 
larly shown. Part UI. sect. iv. that such a necessity as 
has been maintained, is not inconsistent with the propriety 
and fitness of Divine commands ; and for the same rea*

son, not inconsistent with the sincerity and invitations and 
counsels, in the corolary at the end of that section. Yea, 
it hath been shown, Part III. sect. vii. corol. 1. that this 
objection of Ai^minians, concerning the sincerity and use 
of Divine exhortations, invitations, and counsels, is de- 
monstrably against themselves. 

Notwithstanding, I would further observe, that the diffi- 
culty of reconciling the sincerity of counsels, invitations, 
and persuasions, with such an antecedent known fixedness 
of all events, as has been supposed, is not peculiar to this 
scheme, as distinguished from that of the generality of A rmi- 
nians, which acknowledge the absolute foreknowledge of 
God : and therefore it would be unreasonably brought as an 
objection against my differing from them. The main seem- 
ing difficulty in the case is this : that God, in counselling, 
inviting, and persuading, makes a show of aiming at, 
seeking, and using endeavors for the thing exhorted and 
persuaded to ; whereas, it is impossible for any intel- 
ligent being truly to seek, or use endeavors for a thing, 
which he at the same time knows, most perfectly, will 
not come to pass ; and that it is absurd to suppose, be 
makes the obtaining of a thing his end, in bis calls and 
counsels, which he at the same time, infallibly knows will 
not be obtained by these means. Now if God knows 
this, in the utmost certainty and perfection, the way by 
which he comes by this knowledge makes no difference. 
If he knows it is by the necessity which he sees in things, 
or by some other means, it alters not the case. But it is 
in effect allowed by Arminians themselves, that God's in- 
viting and persuading men to do filings which he, at the 
same time, certainly knows will not be done, is no evi- 
dence of insincerity ; because they allow, that God has 



380 OF THE OBJECTION PART IT. 

a certain foreknowledge of all men's sinful actions and 
omissions. And as this is thus implicitly allowed by most 
Arminians, so all that pretend to own the Scriptures to 
be the word of God, must be coni^trained to allow it.— 
God commanded and counselled Pharaoh to let his peo- 
ple go, and used arguments and persuasions to induce him 
to it ; he laid before him arguments taken from his infi* 
nite greatness and almighty power, (Exod. vii. 16.) and 
forewarned him of the fatal consequences of his refusal, 
from time to time ; (chap. viii. 1, ^2, 20, 21 ; chap. ix. 1 
— 5, 13 — 17 ; andx. 3,6.) He commanded Moses, and 
the elders of Israel, to go and be.r^eecli Pharaoh to let the 
people go ; and at the same time told them, he knew 
surely that he would not comply to it. Exod. iii. IS, 19: 
'' And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, un« 
to the king of Egypt, and you shall say unto him ; The 
Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us ; and now 
let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the 
wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God." 
And, <^ I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you 
go." So our blessed Saviour, the evening wherein he 
was betrayed, knew that Peter would shamefully deny 
him before the morning ; for he declares it to him with 
asseverations, to show the certainty of it ; and tells the 
disciples, that all of them should be offended because of 
him that night ; Matt. xxvi. 31 — 35. John xiii. 38. 
Luke xxii. 31 — 34. John xvi. 32. And yet it was 
their duty to avoid these things ; they were very sinful 
things, which God had forbidden, and which it was their 
duty to watch and pray against ; and they were obliged to 
do so from the counsels and persuasions Christ used with 
them, at that very time, so to do ; Matt. xxvi. 41, '^ Watch 



SECT. XI. FROM OOD'^ MOtlAL CHARACtEtl* 381 

and pray, that ye enter not into temptation." So that 
whatever difficulty there can be in this matter, it can be 
no objection against any principles which have been main^ 
tained in opposition to the principles of Arminians ; nor 
does it any more concern me to remove the difficulty, than 
it does them, or indeed all that call themselves Christians, 
and acknowledge the Divine authority of the Scriptures. 
Nevertheless, this matter may possibly (God allowing) be 
more particularly and largely considered, in some future 
discourse on the doctrine of predestination. 

But I would here observe, that however the defenders 
of that notion of liberty of will which I have opposed, ex* 
claim against the doctrine of Calvinists, as tending to bring 
men into doubts concerning the moral perfections of God ; 
it is their scheme, and not the scheme of Calvinists, that 
indeed is justly chargeable with this. For it is one of the 
most fundamental points of their scheme of things, that a 
freedom of will, consisting in self-determination, without 
all necessity, is essential to moral agency. This is the 
same thing as to say, that such a determination of the wilb 
without all necessity, must be in all intelligent beings, in 
those things wherein they are moral agents, or in* their 
moral acts : and from this it will follow, that God's will is 
not necessarily determined, in anything he does, as a 
morpl ageniy or in any of his acts that are of a moral na^ 
ture : so that in all things, wherein he acts holily, justly, 
and truly, he does not act necessarily ; or his will is not 
necessarily determined to act holily and justly ; because, 
if it were necessarily determined, he would not be a mor-^ 
al agent in thus acting ; his will would be attended with 
necessity, which, they say, is inconsistent with moral 
agency : — ^** He cap act no otherwise 5 he is at no liberty 



382 OF A&M INIAN ARGUMENTS. PART tV. 

in the affair ; be is determined by unavoidable, invincible 
necessity : therefore such agency is no moral agency ; yea, 
no agency at all, properly speaking : a necessary agent is 
no agent : he being passive, and subject to necessitjr, 
what he does is no act of his, but an effect of a necessity 
prior to any act of his." This is agreeable to their man- 
ner of arguing. Now then, what is become of all our 
proof of the moral perfections of God ? How can we 
prove that God certainly will, in any one instance, do that 
which is just and holy, seeing his will is determined in the 
matter by no necessity ? We have no other way of prov- 
ing that anything certainly will be, but only by the ne- 
cessity of the event. Where we can see no necessity, but 
that the thing may be, or may not be, there we are una- 
voidably left at a loss. We have no other way properly 
and truly to demonstrate the moral perfections of God, 
but the way that Mr. Chubb proves them, in pp. 252, 
261, 262, 263, of bis Tracts, viz. that God must neces- 
sarily perfectly know what is most worthy and valuable 
in itself, which, in the nature of things, is best and fittest 
to be done. And as this is most eligible in itself, he, be- 
ing omniscient, must see it to be so : and being both om- 
niscient and self-sufficient, cannot have any temptation to 
reject it ; and so must necessarily will that which is best. 
And thus, by this necessity of the determination of God's 
will to what is good and best, w« demonstrably establish 
God's moral character. 

Corol. fVora things which have been observed, it ap- 
pears, that most of the arguments from Scripture, which 
Arminians make use of to support their scheme, are no 
other than begging the question. For in these their argu- 
ments, they determine in the first place, that without such 



SECT. XI. OF ARMINIAN ARGUMENTS. 383 

a freedom of will as they hold, men cannot be proper 
moral agents, nor the subjects of command, counsel, per- 
suasion, invitation, promises, threatenings, expostulations, 
rewards, and punishments ; and that without such free- 
dom, it is to no purpose for men to take any care, or use 
any diligence, endeavors, or means, in order to their avoid- 
ing sin, or becoming holy, escaping punishment, or obtain- 
ing happiness: and having supposed these things, which 
are grand things in question in the debate, then they heap 
up Scriptures, containing commands, counsels, calls, warn- 
ings, persuasions, expostulations, promises, and threaten- 
ings, (as, doubtless, they may find enough such ; the Bi- 
ble is confessedly full of them, from the beginning to the 
end) : and then they glory, how full the Scripture is on 
their side, how many more texts there are that evidently 
favor their scheme, than such as seem to favor the con- 
trary. But let them first make manifest the things in 
question, which they suppose and take for granted, and 
show them to be consistent with themselves, and produce 
clear evidence of their truth ; and they have gained their 
point, as all will confess, without bringing one Scripture. 
For none denies, that there are commands, counsels, prom- 
ises, threatenings, etc. in the Bible. But unless they do 
these things, their multiplying such texts of Scripture is in- 
significant and vain. 

It may further be observed, that such Scriptures as they 
bring are really against them, and not for them. As it 
has been demonstrated, that it is their scheme, and not 
ours, that is inconsistent with the use of motives and per- 
suasives, or any moral means vvhatsoever, to induce men 
to the practice of virtue, or abstaining from wickedness : 
their principles, and not ours, are repugnant to moral

agency, and inconsisteat with moral government, with law 
or precept, with the nature of virtue or vice, reward or 
punishment, and with everything whatsoever of a moral 
nature, either on the part of the moral governor, or in the 
state, actions, or conduct of the subject. 

SECTION XII. 

OF A SUPPOSED TENDENCY OF THESE PRINCIPLES TO ATHEISlt 

AND LICENTIOUSNESS. 

If any object against what has been maintained, that it 
tends to atheism ; I know not on what grounds such an ob- 
jection can be raised, unless it be, that some atheists have 
hdd a doctrine of necessity, which they suppose to be like 
this. But if it be so, I am persuaded the Arminians 
would not look upon it just, tiiat their notion of freedom 
and^ontingence should be charged with a tendency to all 
the errors that ever any embraced who have held such 
opinions. The Stoic philosophers, whom the Calvinists 
are charged with agreeing with, were no atheists, but the 
greatest theists, and nearest akin to Christians in their 
opinions concerning the unity and the perfections of the 
Godhead, of all the heathen philosophers. And Epicu- 
rus, that chief father of atheism, maintained no such doc- 
trine of necessity, but was the greatest maintainer of con- 
tingence. 

The doctrine of necessity, which supposes a necessary 
connection of all events, on some antecedent ground and 
reason of their existence, is the only medium we*have to 
prove the being of God. And the contrary doctrine of 
coutingence, even as maintained by Arminians (which 
certainly implies or infers that events may come into esL- 



9fiCT. %n. TCND TO ATHEISM. 88S 

istence, or begin to be, without dependence on anything 
foregoing, as their cause, ground, or reason,) lakes away 
all proof of the being of God ; which proof is summarily 
expressed by the apostle in Rom. i. 20. And this is a 
tendency to atheism with a witness. So that, indeed, it 
is the doctrine of Arminians, and not of the Calvrnist$, 
that is justly charged with a tendency to atheism ; it being 
built on a foundation that is the utter subversion of every 
demonstrative argument for the proof of a deity ; as has 
been shown, Part II. sect. iii. 

And whereas it has often been said, that the Calvinis- 
tic docttine of necessity saps the foundations of all religion 
and virtue, and tends to the greatest licentiousness of prac- 
tice ; this objection is built on the pretence, that our doc- 
trine renders vain all means and endeavors in order to be 
virtuous and religious. Which pretence has been already 
particularly considered in the fifth section of this Part ; 
where it has been demonstrated, that this doctrine has no 
such tendency : but that such a tendency is truly to be 
charged on the contrary doctrine ; inasmuch as the notion 
of contingence, which their doctrine implies, in its certain 
consequences, overthrows all connection, in every degree, 
between endeavor and event, means and end. 

And besides, if many ottver things, which have been 
observed to belong to the Arminian doctrine, or to be 
plain consequences of it, be considered, there will appear 
just reason to suppose that it is that which must ratbet 
tend to licentiousness. Their doctrine excuses all evil In- 
clinations, which men find to be natural ; because in such 
inclinations they are not self-determined, as such inclina- 
tkms are not owing to any choice or determination of their 

33 ' 



386 WHETHER THESE PBIliClPLE^ »AB¥ IV* 

own wills : — which leads men wholly to justify themselves 
10 all their wicked actions, so far as natural inclinatioa has 
had a hand in determining their wills to the coramissioa aS 
^them. Yea, these notions, which suppose moral neces- 
sity and inability to be inconsistent with blame or moral 
obligation, will directly lead men to justify the vilest acts 
and practices, from the strength of their wicked inclina- 
tions of all sorts ; strong inclinations inducing a moral ne- 
cessity ; yea, to excuse every degree of evil inclination, so 
far as this has evidently prevailed, and been the thing 
which has determined their wills : because, so far as an- 
tecedent inclination determined the will, so far the will was 
without liberty of indifference and self«-deterniinatioa. 
Which at last, will come to this, that men will justify 
themselves in all the wickedness they commit. It has 
been observed^already, that this scheme of things does 
exceedingly diminish the guilt of sin, and the difference 
between the greatest aiid smallest offences ;"* and if it be 
pursued in its real consequences, it leaves room for no such 
thing as either virtue or vice, blame or praise, in the 
world .f And then, again, how naturally does this notion ^ 
o|f the sovereign self-determining power of the will, in all 
things, virtuous or vicious, and whatsoever deserves either 
reward or punishment, tend to encourage men to put off 
the work of religion and virtue, and turning from sin to 
God ; it being that which they have a sovereign power 
to determine themselves to, just when they please; or if 
not, they are wholly excusable in going on in sin, because 
of their inability to do any other.

If it should be said, that the tendency of this doctrine 
of necessity to licentiousness appears by the improvement 
many at this day actually make of it, to justify themselves 
in their dissolute courses : I will not deny that some men 
do unreasonably abuse this doctrine, as they do many other 
things which are true and excellent in their own nature : 
but I deny that this proves the doctrine itself has any ten- 
dency to licentiousness. I think, the tendency of doc- 
trines, by what now appears in the world, and in our na- 
tion in particular, may much more justly be argued from 
the general effect which has been seen to attend the pre- 
vailing of the principles of Anninians, and the contrary 
principles ; as both have had, their turn of general preva- 
alence in our nation. If i( be indeed, as is pretended, 
that Calvinistic doctrines undermine the very foundatioQ 
of all religion and morality, and enervate and disannul all 
rational motives to holy and virtuous practice ; and that 
the contrary doctrines give the inducements to virtue and 
goodness their proper force, and exhibit religion in a ra- 
tional light, tending to recommend it to the reason of 
mankind, and enforce it in a manner that is agreeable to 
their natural notions of things : I say, if it be thus, it is 
remarkable that virtue and religious practice should pre- 
vail most, when the former doctrines, so inconsistent with 
it, prevailed almost universally : and that ever since the 
latter doctrines, so happily agreeing with it, and of so 
proper and excellent a tendency to promote it, have been 
gradually prevailing, vice, profaneness, luxury, and wicked- 
ness of all sorts, ^nd contempt of all religion, and of every 
kind of seriousness and strictness of conversation; should 
proportionably prevail ; and that these things should thus 
accompany one another, and rise and prevail one with

that this happy remedy (discovered by the free ioquiriesy

but tbal the consequence should be the reverse of amend- 
ment ; that in proportion as the remedy takes place, aod 
is thoroughly applied, so the disease should prevail ; aod 
the very same dismal effect take place, to the highest de- 
gree, which Calvinistic doctrines are supposed to have so 
great a tendency to ; even the banishing of religion and 
virtue, and tlie prevailing of unbounded licentiousness of 
manners. If these things are truly so, they are very re- 
markable, and the matter of very curious s]>ecuIation. 

SECTION xm. 

CONCERNING THAT OBJECTION AGAINST THE REASONING BY 
WHICH THE CALVINISTIC DOCTRINE IS SUPPORTEP, THAT 
IT IS METAPHYSICAL AND ABSTRUSE. 

It has often been objected against the defenders of Cal- 
vinistic principles, that in their reasonings they run into 
nice scholastic distinctions, and abstruse metaphysical sob- 
tilties,and set these in opposition to common sense. And 
it is possible, that, after the former manner, it may be al- 
leged against th6 reasoning by which I have endeavored 
to confute the Arminian scheme of libcfrty and moral 
agency, that it is very abstracted and metaphysical, — Con* 
cerning this, I would observe the following things. 

I. If that be made an objection against the foregoipg 
reasoning, that it is mciaphy9%C(Ui or may properly be re- 



9£CT. %nu AND ABSTRUSfi EfiASONlNO. 389 

duced to the aeience of metaphysicsy it is a very imperti- 
nent objection ; whether it be so or no, is not worthy of 
any dispute or controversy. If the reasoning be good, it 
is as frivolous to inquire what science it is properly redu- 
ced to, as what language it is delivered fin : and for a 
man to go about to confute the arguments of his oppo- 
nent, by telling him his arguments are metaphysical, 
would be as weak as to tell him, his arguments could not 
be substantial, because they were written in French or 
Latin. ' The question is not, whether what is said be 
metaphysics, physics, logic or mathematics, Latin, French, 
English, or Mohawk ? But, whether the reasoning be 
good, and the arguments truly conclusive ? The fore- 
going arguments are no more metaphysical, than those 
which we use against the papists, to disprove their doc- 
trine of transubstantiation ; alleging, it is inconsistent with 
the notion of corporeal identity, that it should be in ten 
thousand places at the same t^ime. It is by metaphysical 
arguments only we are able to prove, that the rational 
soul is not corporeal ; that lead or sand cannot think ; 
that thoughts are not square or round, or do not weigh a 
pound. The arguments by which w^ prove the being 
of God, if handled closely and distinctly, so as to show 
their clear and demonstrative evidence, must be meta- 
physically treated. It is by metaphysics only, that we 
can demonstrate that God is not limited to a place, or is 
not mutable ; that he is not ignorant or forgetful ; that it 
is impossible for him to lie or be unjust ; aud that there 
is one God only, and not hundreds or thousands. And^ 
indeed, we have no strict demonstration of anything, ex- 
cepting mathenratical truths, but by metaphysics. We 
can have no proof, that is properly demonstrative! of any 

33* 



890 or MBTAPflTSlCAL PART IT. 

one proposition, relating to the being and nature of God, 
bis creation of the world, the dependence of all things on 
him, the nature of bodies or spirits, the nature of^our own 
souls, or any of the great truths of ofiorality and natural 
religion, but what is metaphysical. I am willing my ar« 
guments should be brought to the test of the stricteat and 
justest reason, and that a clear, distinct, and determinate 
meaning of the terms I use, should be insisted on ; but let 
not the whole be rejected, as if all were confuted, by fix- 
ing on it the epithet metaphysicaL 

H. If the reasoning which has been made use of, be in 
some sense metaphysical, it will not follow, that therefore 
it must needs be abstruse, unintelligible, and akin to the 
jargon of the schools. I humbly conceive, the foregoing 
reasoning, at least to those things which are most mate- 
rial belonging to it, depends on no abstruse definitions, or 
distinctions or terms without a meaning, or of very ambigu- 
ous and undetermined signification, or any points of such 
abstraction and subtiliy, as tends to involve the attentive un* 
derstanding in clouds a,nd darkness. Tliere is no high de- 
gree of refinement and abstruse speculation, in determining 
that a thing is not before it is, and socannot be the cause of it- 
self ; or that the first act of free choice has not anotl>er act 
of free choice going before that, to excite or direct it ; or in 
determining, that no choice is made, while the miod re- 
mains in a state of absolute indifierence ; that preference 
and equilibrium never co-exist; and that therefore no 
choice is made in a state of liberty consisting in indiffer- 
ence : and that so far as the will is determined by mo« 
tives, exhibited and operating previous to the act of the 
will, so far it is not determined by the act of the will it- 
self; that nothing can begin lo be, which befote was not^ 



BtiCH;. XIII. AND ABSTinrftti IdSASOi^lNO. 3dt 

without a cause, or some antecedent ground or reason, 
why it then begins to be ; that eflfects depend on their 
causes, and are connected with them ; that Titiue is not 
the worse, nor sin the better, foP the strength of inclina* 
tion with which it is practised, and the difEcuIty which 
thence arises of doing otherwise ; that when it is already 
bfailibly known that the thing will be, it is not a thing 
contingent whether it will ever be or no ; or that it can 
be truly said, notwithstanding, that it is not necessary it 
should be, but it either'may be, or may not be. And the 
like might be observed of many other things which belong 
to the foregoing reasoning. 

If any shall still stand to it, that the foregoing reason- 
ing is nothing but metaphysical sophistry ; and that it 
must be so, that the seeming force of the arguments all 
depends on some fallacy and wile that is hid in the ob- 
scurity which always attends a great degree of metaphysi- 
cal abstraction and refinement ; and shall be ready to say, 
'^ Here is indeed something: that tends to confound the 
mind, but ndt to satisfy it : for who can ever be truly satis- 
fied in it, that men are fitly blamed or commended, pun- 
ished or rewarded, for those volitions which are not from 
themselves, and of whose existence they are not the cau- 
ses. Men may refine as much .as they please, and ad- 
vance their abstract notions, and make out a thousand 
seeming contradictions, to puzzle our understandings ; yet 
there can be no satisfaction in such doctrine as this: the 
natural sense of the mind of man will always resist it.*'*

I humbly conceive thai such an objector, if be has capa- 
city and humility 9 and calmness of spirit, sufficient impar- 
tially and thoroughly to examine himsel/, will find that 

or whether they have managed their arguments well or ill. As to 
the arguments 1 have made use of, if they are quibbles, they may 
be shown so : snch knots are capable of being untied, and the trick 
and cheat may be detected and plainly laid open, if this be fairly 
done, with respect to the grounds and reasons 1 have relied upon, I 
shall baye juat occasion, for the future, to be silent, if not to be 
ashamed of my argumentations. 1 am willing my proofs should be 
thoroughly examined ; and if there be nothing but begging the ques- 
tUm^ or mere logomachy, or dispute of words, let it be made raani&st, 
and shown how the seeming strength of the argument depends on 
my using words without a meaning, or arises from the ambiguity of 
terms, or my making use of words in an indeterminate and unsteady 
manner ; and that the weight of my reasons rests mainly on such a 
foundation : and then I shall either be ready to retract what 1 have 
urged, and thank the man that has done the kind part, or shall 
be justly exposed for my obstinacy. 

The same author is abundant in appealing, in this affair, from 
what he calls logomaehtf amd sophistry to experience. A person can 
experience only what passes in his own mind. But yet, as we may 
well suppose that all men have the same human faculties, so a main 
may well argue from his own experience to that of others, in things 
that show the nature of those faculties, and the manner of their 
operation. But tlien one has as good, right to allege his experience 
as another. As to my own experience, 1 find that in innumerable 
things I can do as I will ; that the motions of my body, in many re- 
spects, instantaneously follow the acts of my will concerning those 
motions ; and that my will has some command of my thoughts ; and 
that the acts of my will are my own, i. e. that they are acts of my 
will, the volitions of my own mind ; or, in other words, that what 1 
will, I will. Which I presume is the sum of what others experience in 
this affair. But as to finding by experience that my will is originally 
determined by itself; or that, my will first choosing what volition 
there shall be,. the chosen volition accordingly follows, and that this 
is the first rise of the determination of my will in any affair, or that 
any volition rises in my mind contingently ; 1 declare I know nothing 
in myself by experience of this nature ', and nothing that ever I expe-

he knows not really >vbat he would be at ; and, indeed, 
his difBcuIty is nothing but a mere prejudice, fixmi an in» 
advertent custoo^ry use of words, in a meaning that is 
not clearly understood, nor carefully reflected upon. Let 
the objector reflect again, if he has candor and patience 
enough, and does not ^corn to be at the trouble of close 
attention in the affair. He would have a man's volition 
he from himself. Let it he from himself, raost primarily 
and originally of any way conceivable ; that is, from, his 
own choice : how will that help the matter, as to his be* 
ing justly blamed or praised, unless that choice itself be 
blame or praiseworthy ? And how is the choice itself 
(an ill choice, for instance) blameVorthy, according to 
these principles, unless that be from himself too, in the 
same manner ; that is, from his own choice ? But the 
original and first determining choice in the affair is not 
from his choice : his choice is not the cause ^f it. And if 
it be from himself some other way, and not from bis choice, 
surely that will not help the matter. If it be not from 
himself of choice, then it is not from himself volunta- 
rily ; and if so, he is surely no more to blame, than if it 
were not from himself at alL It is a vanity to pretend it 
is a sufficient answer to this to say, that it is nothing 

rienced carries the least appearance or shadow of any such thin^, or 
gives me anj more reason to suppose or suspect any such thing, 
than to suppose that ifiy volitions existed twenty years before they 
existed, it is true, 1 find myself possessed of my volitions before I 
can see the ef!ectual power of any cause to produce them (for the 
power and efficacy of the cause is not seen but by the effect) ; and 
this, for aught I know, may make some imagine that volition has no 
cause, or that it produces itself. But I have no more reason fro^ 
hence to determine any such thing, than I have to determine tbat I 
gave myself my own being, or that I came into being accidentally 
without a cause, because 1 first found myself possessed of being, 
before I had knowledge of a caose of my being,

but metaphysical reGnemeot and subtilty, and so attended 
with obscurity and uqcertainty. 

If it be the natural sense of our minds, that what is 
blameworthy in a roan must be from himself, then it 
doubtless is also, that it must be from sogaetbing bad in 
himself, a bad choice^ or bad disposition. But then our 
natural sense is, that this bad choice or disposition is evil 
in itself y and the man blameworthy for it, on its own ac- 
cotmt, without taking into our notion of its blameworthi- 
ness another bad choice, or disposition going before this, 
from whence this arises : for that is a ridiculous absurdity, 
running us into an immediate contradiction, which our 
natural sense of blameworthiness has nothing to do with, 
and never comes into the mind, nor is supposed in the 
judgment we naturally make of the affiiir. As was dem- 
onstrated before, natural sense does- not place the moral 
evil of volitions and dispositions in the cause of them, 
but the nature of them. An evil thing's being from a 
man, or from something antecedent in him, is not essen- 
tial to the original notion we have of blameworthiness : 
but it is its being the choice of the heart ; as appears by 
t^is, that if a thing he from us, and not from our choice, 
it has not the nature of blameworthiness or ill-desert, ac- 
cording to our natural sense. When a thing is fi'om a 
man, in that sense, that it is from his will or choice, he is 
to blame for it, because his will is in it.: so far as the 
will is in it, blame is in it, and no further. Neither do 
we go any further in our notion of blame, to inquire 
whether the bad will be from a bad will : there is no 
consideration of the original of that bad will ; because, 
according to our natural apprehension, blame originally 
consists in it. Therefore a thing's being from a man 



SECT..XIII. A FAULT OF ARMINIAN WRITERS. 395 

is a secondary consideration in tbc notion of blame or ill- 
desert. Because those things, in our external actions, 
are most properly said to be from us, which are from our 
choice : and no other external actions, but those that are 
from us in this sense, have the nature of blame ; and 
they, indeed, not so properly because they are jfrow tw, 
as because we are in them, i. e. our wills are in them ; 
not so much because they are from sonf^ property of ours, 
as because they are owt properties. 

However, all these external actions being truly from 
iis, as their cause ; and we being so used, in ordinary 
speech, and in the common affairs of life, to speak of 
men's actions and conduct that we see, and that affect 
human society, as deserving ill or well, as worthy of blame 
or praise ; hence it is come to pass, that philosophers have 
incautiously taken all their measures of good and evil, 
praise and blame, from the dictates of common sense, 
about these overt acts of men ; to the running of every 
thing into the most lamentable and dreadful confusion. 
And therefore I observe : 

III. It is so far from being true (whatever may be pre- 
tended) that the proof of the doctrine which has been 
maintained depends on certain abstruse, unintelligible, 
metaphysical terms and notions, and that the Arminian 
scheme, without needing such clouds and darkness for its 
defence, is supported by the plain dictates of connmon 
sense, that the very reverse is most certainly true, and that 
to a great degree. It is fact that they, and not we, have 
confounded things with metaphysical, unintelligible notions 
and phrases, and have drawn them ifom the light of plain 
truth into the gross darkness of abstruse metaphysical pro- 
positions, and words without a meaning. Their pretended 



396 ARMtNtANS TOO KBTAPRTslcAL. PART IT. 

deraoDStrations depend very much on such unintelligible 
metaphysical phrases, as stlf^dtiermination and sorot^ 
reignty of the tnl ; and the metaphysical sense they put 
on such terms as necessity, contingency , action^ agency^ 
etc. quite diverse from their meaning as used in commoo 
speech ; and which, as they use them, are without any- 
consistent meaning, or any manner of distinct ideas ; as 
far from it as any of the abstruse terms and perplexed 
phrases of the peripatetic philosophers, or the most unio- 
telligible jargon of the schools, or the cant of the wildest 
fanatics.* Yea, we may be bold to say, these metaphysi- 
cal terms, on which they build so much, are what they use 
without knowing what they mean themselves; they !ire 
pure metaphysical sounds, without any ideas whatsoever 
in their minds to answer them ; inasmuch as it has been 
demonstrated, tiiat there cannot be any notion in the 
mind consistent with these expressions, as they pretend 
to explain them, because their explanations destroy them* 
selves. No such notions as imply self-contradiction and 
self-abolition, and this a great many ways, can subsist in 
the mind ; as there can be no idea of a whole which is 
less than any of its parts, or of solid extension without di- 
mensions, or of an effect which is before its cause. Armi- 
nians improve these terms as terms of art, and in their 
metaphysical meaning, to advance and establish those 
things which are contrary to common sense, in a high de- 
gree. Thus instead of the plain, vulgar notion of liberty, 
which all mankind, in every part of the face of the earth, 
and in all ages, have, consisting in opportunity to do as 
one pleases, they have introduced a new, strange liberty, 
consisting in indifference, contingence, and self-determina* 
tion, by which they involve themselves and others in great 



SECT. Xltt. ARMINIAN3 TOO METAPHYSICAL. 397 

obscurity and manifold gross inconsistence. So, instead 
of placing virtue and vice, as common sense places them 
very much, in fixed bias and inclination, and greater vir- 
tue and vice in stronger and more established inclination ; 
these, through their refinings and abstruse notions, suppose 
a liberty consisting in indifference, to be essential to all 
virtue and vice. So they have reasoned themselves, not 
by jnetaphysical distinctions, but metaphysical confusion, 
into many principles about moral agency, blame, praise, 
reward, and punishment, which are as has been shown, 
exceeding^ contrary to the common sense of mankind ; and 
perhaps to their own sense, which governs them in com- 
mon life.

CONCLUSION. 

Whether the things which have been alleged are lia- 
ble to any tolerable answer in the v^nys of calm, intelligi- 
ble, and strict reasoning, I must leave others to judge ; 
but I am sensible ihej are liable to one sort df answer. 
It is not unlikely, that some, who value themselves on 
the supposed rational and generous principles of the mod- 
em fashionable divinity, will have their indignation and 
disdain raised at the sight of this discourse, and on per- 
ceiving what things are pretpnded to be proved in it. 
And if they think it worthy of being read, or of so much 
notice as to say much about it, they may probably renew 
the usual exclamations, with additional vehemence and 
contempt, about the fate of the heathen^ Hobbes's neces- 
sity and making men mere m^ichines ; accumulating the 
terrible epithets of fatal, unfrustrabhy inevitable, irresist^ 
ibhy etc., and, it may be, with the addition of horrid and 
blasphemous; and perhaps much skill may be used to set 
forth things, which have been said, in colors wliich shall 
be shocking to the imaginations, and moving to the pas- 
sions of those who have either too little capacity, or too 
much confidence of the opinions they have imbibed, and 
contempt of the contrary, to try the matter by any serious 
and circumspect examination.''^ Or, difficulties may be

casion to mention, speaks once and again of those who hold the doc-

started and ioststed on, which do not belong, to the 
controversy ; because let them be more or less real, 
and hard to be resolved, they are not what are ow* 
iDg to anything distinguishing of this scheme from that 
of the Arminians, and would not be removed nor dimin- 
ished by renouncing the former, and adhering to the lat- 
ter. Or, some particular things may be picked out, 
which they may tliink sound harshest in the ears of the 
generality ; and these may be glossed and descanted on, 
with tart and contemptuous words ; and from thence, the 
whole treated with ti'iumph and insult. 

It is easy to see how the decision of most of the points 
in controversy betweea Calvtnists and Arminians depends 
on the determination of this grand article concerning the 
freedom of tjit will requisite to moral agency ; and that 
by clearing and establishing the Calvinistic doctrine in 
this point, the chief arguments are obviated by which 
Arminiah doctrines in general are supported, and the con- 
trary doctrines in general are demonstratively conOrmed. 
Hereby it becomes manifest, that God's moral govern- 
ment over mankind, bis treating them as moral agents, 

cessity , that some may have maintained ) and, if so, what doctrine of 
necessity it is that he means. — Whether I am worthy of the name of 
a philosopher, or not, would be a question little to the present purpose . 
If any, and ever so many, should deny it, I should not think it worth 
the while to enter into a dispute on that question : though at the 
same time, I might expect some better answer should be given to the 
arguments brought for the truth of the doctrine 1 maintain ; and 1 
Blight further reasonably desire, that it might be considered, wheth- 
er it does not become those who are tridy fcorthy of the name of 
philosophers, to be sensible that there is a difference between argu- 
ment and contempt; yea, and a difierence between the contemptible* 
ness of the person that argues, and the incohclQaivenesa of the ar-^ 
guments be offers. 



400 CONCLUSION. 

makiDg them the objecis of his commaDdSy counsels, calls, 
. warniags, expostulations, promises, threatenings, rewards, 
and punishments, is not inconsistent with a determining 
disposal of all events, of every kind, throughout the uni* 
verse, in his providence; either by positive efficiency or 
permission. Indeed, such a universal determining pro^ 
vidence infers some kind of necessity of all events, such a 
necessity as implies an infallible previous fixedness of the 
futurity of the event ; but do other necessity of moral 
events, or volitions of intelligent agents, is needful in order 
to this, than moral necessity ; which does as much ascer- 
tain the futurity of the event as any other necessity. But, 
as has been demonstrated, such a necessity is not at all 
repugnant to moral agency, and a reasonable use of com- 
mands, calls, rewards, punishments, etc. Yea, not only 
are objections of this kind against the doctrine of a uni- 
versal determining Providence, removed by what has 
been said ; but the truth of such a doctrine is demonstra- 
ted. As it has been demonstrated, that the futurity of 
all future events is established by previous necessity, ei- 
ther natural or moral ; so it is manifest, that the sovereign 
Creator and Disposer of the world has ordered this ne- 
cessity, by ordering his own conduct, either in designedly 
acting, or forbearing to act. For, as the being of the 
world is from God, so the circumstances in which it had 
its being at first, both negative and positive, must be or- 
dered by him, in one of these ways ; and all the necessa- 
ry consequences of these circumstances must be ordered 
by him. And God's active and positive interpositions, 
after the world was created, and the consequences of these 
interpositions ; also every instance of his forbearing to in- 
terpose, and the sure consequences of this forbearance ;

must all be determined according to his pleasure. Apd 
therefore every event, which is the consequence of any- 
thing whatsoever, or that is connected with any foregoing 
thing or circunirtance, either positive or negative, as thp 
ground or reason of its existence, must be ordered of God ; 
either by a designing efficiency and interposition, or a de- 
signed forbearing to operate or interpose. But, as has 
been proved, all events whatsoever are necessarily con- 
nected with sonjething foregoing, either positive or nega- 
tive, which is the ground of its existence. It follows^ 
therefore, that the whole series of events is thus connect- 
ed with something in the state of things, either positive or 
negative, which is original in the series ; t. e. something 
which is connected with nothing preceding that, but God's 
own immediate conduct, either his acting or forbearing to 
act. From whence it follows^ that as God designedly or- 
ders his own conduct, and its connected consequences, it 
must necessarily be, that he designedly orders all things. 
The things which have been said obviate some of the 
chief objections of Arminians against the Calvinistic doc- 
trine of the total depravity and corruption of man^s na- 
ture, whereby his heart is wholly under the power of sin, 
and he is utterly unable, without the interposition of sove- 
reign grace, savingly to love God, believe in Christ, or 
do anything that is truly good and acceptable in God's 
sight. For the main objection against this doctrine is, that 
it is inconsistent with the freedom of man's will, consist- 
ing in indifference and self-determining power ; because 
it supposes man to be under a necessity of sinning, and 
that God Inquires things of him, in order to his avoiding 
eternal dainnation, which he is unable to do; and that 
this doctrine is >vholly inconsistent witl) the sincerity of 

34* 



^ 



403 coBTCLrsionr. 

counsels, invitations, etc. Now., this doctrine supposes tio 
other necessity of sinning, than a moral necessity ; which, 
as has been shown, does not at all excuse sin ; and sup- 
poses no other inability to obey any command, or perform 
any duty, even the most spiritual and exalted, but a moral 
inability, which, as has been proved, does not excuse per- 
sons in the non-performance of any good thing, or make 
them not to be the proper objects of commands, counsels, 
and invitations. And, moreover, it has been shown, that 
there is not, and never can be, either in existence, or so 
much as in idea, any such freedom of will consisting in in- 
difference and self-determination, for the sake of which, 
this doctrine of original sin is cast out ; and that no such 
freedom is necessary, in order to the nature of sin, and a 
just desert of punishment. 

The things which have been observed do also take off 
the main objections of Arminians against the doctrine of 
efficacious grace ; and, at the same time, prove the grace 
of God in a sinner's conversion (if there be any grace or 
Divine influence in the affair) to be efficacious^ yea, and ir- 
resisiible too ; if by irresistible is meant, that which is at- 
tended with a moral necessity, which it is impossible should 
ever be violated by any resistance. The main objection 
of Arminians against this doctrine is, that it is inconsistent 
with their self-determining freedom of will ; and that it is 
repugant to the nature of virtue, that it should be wrought 
in the heart by the determining efficacy and power of ano- 
ther, instead of its being owing to a self-moving power ; 
that, iii that case, the good which is wrought, would not 
be our virtue, but rather God^s virtue ; because it is not 
the person in whom it ic wrought, that is the determining 
author of it, but God that wrought it in him. But the 



CONCLUSION. 403 

things which are the foundation of these objections have 
been considered ; and it has been demonstrated, that the 
liberty of moral agents does not consist in self-determin* 
ing power ; and that there is no need of any such liberty 
in order to the nature of virtue ; nor does it at all hin-> 
der, but that the state or act of the will may be the virtue 
of the subject, though it be not from self-determination, 
but the determination of an intrinsic cause ; even so as to 
■ cause the event to be morally necessary to the subject of 
it. And as it has been proved, that nothing in the state 
or acts of the will of man is contingent ; but that, on the 
contrary, every event of this kind is necessary by a moral 
necessity ; and has also been now demonstrated, that the 
doctrine of a universal determining Providence follows 
from that doctrine of necessity which was proved before ; 
and so, that God does decisively, in his providence, order 
all the volitions of moral agents, either by positive influ- 
ence or permission ; and it being allowed, on all hands, 
that what God does in the affair of man's virtuous voli- 
tions, whether it be more or less, is by some positive in- 
fluence, and not by mere permission, as in the afl^ir of a 
sinful volition : ' if we put these things together, it will fol- 
low, that God's assistance or influence must be determin- 
ing and decisive, or must be attended with a moral ne- 
cessity of the event ; and so that God gives virtue, holi- 
ness, and conversion to sinners, by an influence^ which 
determines the effect, in such a manner, that the effect 
will infallibly follow by a moral necessity, which is what 
Calvinists mean by efiBcacious and irresistible grace. 

The things which have been said do likewise answer 
the chief objections against the doctrine of God's untver- 
sal and absolute decree, and afford infallible proof of this

doctrioe ; and of the doctrine of cbiohUe^ eternal^ person" 
oZ election in particular. The main objections against 
these doctrines are, that they infer a necessity of the voli* 
tions of moral agents, and of the future moral state and 
acts of men ; and so are not consistent with those eternal 
rewardsb^and punishments, which are connected with con* 
version and impenitence ; *nor can be made to agree with 
the reasonableness and sincerity of the precepts, calls, 
counsels, warnings, and expostulations of the word of God ; 
or with the various methods and means of grace which 
God uses with sinners to bring them to repentance ; anid 
the whole of that moral government \<^hich God exercises 
towards mankind : and that they infer an inconsistence 
between the secret and revealed will of God^ and make 
God the author of sin. But all these things have been 
obviated in the preceding discourse. And the certain 
truth of these doctrines concerning God's eternal purpo- 
ses, will follow from what was just now observed con- 
cerning God's universal providence ; how it infallibly' fol- 
lows from what has been proved, that God orders all 
events, and the volitions of moral agents amongst others, 
by such a decisive disposal, that the events are infallibly 
connected with his disposal. For if God disposes all 
events, so that the infallible existence of the events is de- 
cided by his providence, then he, doubtless, thus orders 
and decides things Tcnowinglyj and on design. God does 
not do what he does, nor order what he orders, accident- 
ally and unawares ; either without or heside his intention. 
And if there be a foregoing design of doing and ordering 
as he does, this is the same with a purpose or decree* 
And as it has been showa that nothing is new to God, in 
any respect, but all things are perfectly and equally in bis 



CONCLUStOJ^. 4o5 

view from eteroity ; hence it will follow, that his desigos 
or purposes are not things formed anew, founded on any 
new views or appearances, but are all eternal purposes. 
And as it has been now shown how the doctrine of deter- 
mining efficacious grace certainly follows from things pro- 
ved in the foregoing discourse ; hence will necessarily fol- 
low the doctrine of particular, eternal, absolute election. 
For if men are made true saints no otherwise than as God 
makes them so, and distinguishes them from others, by an 
efficacious power and influence of his, that decides and 
fixes the event ; and God thus makes some saints, and 
not others, on design or purpose, and (as has been now 
observed) no designs of God are new ; it follows, that 
God thus distinguished from others, all that*ever become 
true saints, by his eternal design or decree. I might also 
show how God's certain foreknowledge must suppose an 
absolute decree, and how such a decree can ^e proved to 
a demonstration from it : but that this discourse may not 
be lengthened out too much, that must be omitted for the 
present. 

. From these things it will inevitably follow, that how- 
ever Christ in some sense may be said to die for all^ and 
to redeem all visible Christians, yea, the whole world, by 
his death ; yet there must be something particular in the 
design of his death, with respect to such as he intended 
should actually be saved thereby. As appears by what 
has been now shown, God has the actual salvation or re- 
demption of a certain number in his proper al)^olute de- 
sign, and of a certain number only ; and therefore such a 
design ' only can be prosecuted in anything God does, in 
order to the salvation of men. God pursues a proper 
design of the salvation of the elect in giving Christ to die, 



406 CONCLVBIOlf. 

and prosecutes such a design with respect to do other, 
most strictly speaking ; for it is impossible that God should 
prosecute any other design than only such as he has ; he 
certainly does not, in the highest propriety and strictness 
of speech, pursue a design that he has not. And, indeed, 
such a particularity and limitation of redemption will as 
infallibly follow, from the doctrine of God's foreknow- 
ledge, as from4bat of the decree. For it is as impossible 
in strictness of speech, that God should prosecute a de- 
sign, or aim at a thing, which lie at the same time most 
perfectly knows will not be accomplished, as that he should 
use endeavors for that which is beside his decree. 

By the things which ha?e been proved are obviated 
some of the main objections against the doctrine of the 
infallible and necessary J7er«et;erance of saints, and some 
of the main foundations of this doctrine are established. 
The main prejudices of Arminians against this doctrine 
seem to be these : they suppose such a necessary, infalli- 
ble perseverance to be repugnant to the freedom of the 
will ; that it must be owing to man's own self-determin- 
ing power, that hejirst becomes virtuous and holy; and 
so, in like manner, it must be left a thing contingent, to 
be determined by the same freedom of will, whether be 
will persevere in virtue and holiness ; and that otherwise 
bis continuing steadfast in faith and obedience would not 
be his virtue, or at all praiseworthy and rewardable ; nor 
could his perseverance be properly the matter of Divine 
commands, counsels, and promises, nor his apostasy be 
properly threatened, and men warned against it. Whereas, 
we find all these things in Scripture : there we (ind stead- 
fastness and perseverance in true Christianity represen- 
ted as the virtue of the saints, spoken of as praiseworthy 



CONCLUSION. 407 

in them, and glorious rewards promised to it ; and also 
find, that God makes it the subject of his commands, coun- 
sels, and promises ; and the contrary, of tbreatenings and 
warnings. But the foundation of these objections has 
been removed, in its being shown that moral necessity 
and infallible certainty of events is not inconsistent with 
these things ; and that as to freedom of will lying in the 
power of the will to determine itself, there neither is any 
such thing, nor any need of it in order to virtue, reward, 
commands, counsels, etc. 

And as the doctrines of efficacious grace and absolute 
election do certainly follow from things which have been 
proved in the preceding discourse ; so some of the main 
foundatipns of the doctrine of perseverance are thereby 
established. If the beginning cf true faith and holiness, 
and a man's becoming a true saint at first, does not de- 
pend on the self-determining power of the will, but on 
the determining efficacious grace of God ; it may well be 
argued, that it is also with respect to men's being contin- 
ued saints, or persevering in faith and holiness. The con- 
version of a sinner being not owing to a man's self-deter- 
mination, but to God's determination, and eternal election, 
which is absolute, and depending on the sovereign will of 
God, and not on the free will of man as is evident from 
what has been said ; and it being very evident, from the 
Scriptures, that the eternal election which there is of saints 
to faith and holiness, is also an election of them to eter- 
nal salvation : hence their appointment to salvation must 
also be absolute, and not depending qn their contingent, 
self-determining will. From all which it follows, that it 
is absolutely fixed in God's decree, that all true^ saints 
shall persevere to actual. eternal salvation. 



408 CONCLUSIOK. 

But I must leave 9II these things to the consideration 
of the fair and impartial reader ; and when he has maturely 
weighed them, I would propose it to his consideration, 
whether many of the 6rst reformers, and others that suc- 
ceeded them, whom God in their ^ay made the chief pil- 
lars of his church, and greatest instruments of their de- 
liverance from error and darkness, and of the support of 
the cause of piety among them, have not been injured, 
in the contempt with which they have been treated by 
many late writers, for their teaching and maintaining such 
doctrines as are commonly called Cahinisiic. Indeed, 
some of these new writers, at the same time that they 
have represented the doctrines of these ancient and emi- 
nent divines as in the highest degree ridiculous, and con- 
trary to common sense, in an ostentation of a very gen- 
erous charity, have allowed that, they were honest, well- 
meaning men : *yea, it may be, some of them, as though 
it were in great condescension and compassion to them, 
have allowed that they did pretty well for the day which 
they lived in, and considering the great disadvantages they 
labored under : when, at the same time, their manner 
of speaking has naturally and plainly suggested to the 
minds of their readers, that they were persons, who 
through the lowness of their genius, and greatness of the 
bigotry with which their minds were shackled and thoughts 
confined, living in the gloomy caves of superstition, fondly 
embraced, and demurely and zealously taught, the most 
absurd, silly, and monstrous opinions, worthy of the 
greatest contempt of gentlemen possessed of that noble

as d^ey, and on far better grounds. And really all the 
Anninians on earth might be challenged, without arrogance 
or vanity, to make these principles of theirs, wherein they 
mainly differ from their fathers, whom they so much de- 
spise, consistent with common sense ; yea, and perhaps 
to produce any doctrine ever embraced by the blindest 
bigot of the church of Rome, or the most ignorant Mussul* 
man, or extravagant enthusiast, that mjght be reddced to 
more demonstrable inconsistences, and repugnances to 
common sense and to themselves ; though their inconsis- 
tences indeed may not lie so deep, or be so artfully veil* 
ed by a deceitful ambiguity of words, and an ]ndetermi<> 
nate signification of phrases. I will not deny, that these 
gentlemen, many of them, are men of great abilities, and 
have been helped to higher attainments in phibsopby 
than those ancient divines, and have done great service 
to the church of God in some respects : but I humbly 
conceive, that their differing from their fathers, with such 
magisterial assurance, in these points in divinity, must be 
owing to some other cause than superior wisdom. 

It may also be worthy of consideration, whether the 
great alteration which has been made in the state of things 
in our nation, and some other parts of the Protestant world, 
in this and the past age, by the exploding so generally 
Calvinistic doctrines, that is so often spoken of as worthy 
to be greatly rejoiced in by the friends of truth, learning, 
and virtue, as an instance of the great increase of light in 
the Christian cluirch ; I say, it may be worthy to be con- 
sidered, whether this be indeed a happy change, owing to 
^ any such cause as an increase of true knowledge and un- 
derstanding in things of religion ; or whether there is not 

reason to fear, that it may be owing to some worse cause*

410 CONCI.U8IOK. 

Aod I desire it may be considered^ whether the bold- 
ness of some writers may not be worthy to be reflected on. 
who have not scrupled to say, that if these and those 
things are true (which yet appear to be the demonstrable 
dictates of reason, as well as the certain dictates of the 
mouth of the Most High), then God is unjust and cruelj 
and guilty of manifest decejt and double dealing, and the 
like. Yea, some have gone so far, as conBdently to assert, 
that if any book which pretends to be Scripture, teaches 
such doctrines, that alone is sufficient warrant for mankind 
to f€]ect it, as what cannot be the word of God. Some, 
who have not gone so far, have said, that iAhe Scripture 
seems to teach any such doctrines, so contrary to reason, 
we are obliged to find out some other interpretation of 
those texts where such doctrines seem to be exhibited. 
Others express theinselves yet more modestly : they ex- 
pi'ess a tenderness and religious fear, lest they should re- 
ceive and teach anything that should seem to reflect on 
God's moral character, or be a disparagement to h^ me- 
thods of administration, in his moral government; and 
therefore express themselves as not daring to embrace 
some doctrines, though they seem to be delivered in 
Scripture, according to the more obvious and natural con- 
struction of the words. But indeed it would show^ a truer 
modesty and humility, if they would more entirely rely on 
God's wisdom and discerning, who knows infinitely better 
than we what is agreeable to bis own perfections, and 
never intended to leave these matters to the decision of 
the wisdom and discerning of men : but by bis own uner- 
ring instruction, to determine for us what the truth is; 
knowing how little our judgment is to be . depended on, 
and how extremely prone vain and blind men are to err 
in such matters. 



CONCLUSION. 411 

The truth of the case is, that if the Scripture plainly 
taught the opposite doctrines to those that are so much 
stumbled at, viz. the Arminian doctrine of free will, and 
others depending thereon, it would be the greatest of all 
difficulties that attend the Scriptures, incomparably great- 
er than its containing any, even the most mysterious of 
those doctrines of the first reformers, which our late free- 
thinkers have so superciliously exploded, — Indeed, it is a 
glorious argument of the divinity of the holy Scriptures, 
that they teach such doctrines, whicb in one age and 
another, through the blindness of men's minds, and strong 
prejudices of their hearts, are rejected as most absurd and 
unreasonable by the wise and great men of the world; 
which yet, when they are most carefully and strictly ex- 
amined, appear to be exactly agreeable to the most de- 
monstrable, certain, and natural dictates of reason. By 
such things it appears, that the foolishness of God is 
wiser than mm; and God does as is said in 1 Cor. f. 19, 
20 : " For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the 
wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the 
prudent. Where is the W'ise ? where is the scribe ? where 
is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish 
the wisdom of this world ? " And as it is used to be in 
time past, so it is probable it will be in time to come, as 
it is there written, in ver. 27 — 29. " But God hath cho- 
sen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise ; 
and God hath chosen the w^ak things of the world, to 
confound the things that are mighty; and base things of 
the world, and things which are despised, hath God cho- 
sen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to iiought 
things that are ; <hat no flesh should glory in his pre- 
sence.*' Amen,

REMARKS 



OV THE 



ESSAYS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY 
AND NATURAL RELIGION : 

IN A LETTER TO A MINISTER OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLANI>. 

Br THE Rev. JONATHAN EDWARDS, 

President of the CoUege of Ntvo Jersey^ and Author of the late Inqui- 
ry into the Modern Mftions of the Freedom of Will, 

REV. SIB, 

The intimations you have given me of the use which 
has, by some, been made of what I have written on the 
Freedom of the Will, etc., to vindicate what is said on 
the subject of liberty and necessity by the author of the 
Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural He- 
ligion, has occasioned my reading this author's essay on 
that subject with particular care and attention. And I 
think it must be evident to every one that has read both 
his Essay and my Inquiry, that our schemes are exceed* 
ing reverse from each other. The wide difference ap- 
pears particularly in the following things. 

This author supposes, that such a necessity takes 
place with respect to all men's actions, as is inconsistent 
with liberty,* and plainly denies that men have any lib- 
erty in acting. Thus, in p. 168, after he had been speak- 
ing of the necessity of our determinations, as connected 
with motives, he concludes with saying, <' In short, if 
motives are not under our power or direction, which is 
confessedly the fact, we can at bottom have no libertt." 
Whereas, I have abundanjiiy expressed it as my mind, 

* Pagtts 160, 16], 164, 165, and many other places. 



^ 418 

that man, in his moral actions, has true liberty ; and that 
the moral necessity, which universally takes place, is not 
in the least inconsistent with anything that iS' properly 
called liberty, and with the utmost liberty that can be de- 
sired, or that can possibly exist or be conceived of.^ 

I find that some are apt to think, that in that kind of 
moral necessity of men's volitions, which I suppose to be 
universal, at least some degree of liberty is denied ; that 
though it be true 1 allow a sort of liberty, yet those who 
maintain a self-determining power in the will, and a liberty 
of contingence and indifference, hold a higher sort of free- 
dom than I do : but I think this is certainly a great mis- 
take. 

Liberty, as I have explained it, in p. 49^ and other pla- 
ces, is the power J opiaortuniiyy or advarUagey that any 
one has to do as he meases, or conducting, in ant res- 
pect, according to his pleasure ; without considering bow 
his pleasure comes to be as it is. It is demonstrable, and 
I think has been demonstrated, that no necessity of men's 
volitions that I maintain is inconsistent with this liberty : 
and I think it is impossible for any one to rise higher in 
his conceptions of liberty than this. If any imagine they 
desire higher, and that they conceive of a higher and 
greater liberty than this, they are deceived, and delude 
themselves with confused, ambiguous- words, instead of 
ideas. If any one should here say, " Yes, I conceive of 
a freedom above and beyond the liberty a man has of con- 
ducting in any respect as he pleases, viz. a liberty of cAoo- 
sing as be pleases." Such a one, if he reflected, would 
either blush or laugh at his own instance. For, is not 
choosing as be pleases, conducting, in some respect, 
according to his pleasure, and still without determining 
how he came by that pleasure ? If he says, '* Yes, I 
came by that pleasure by my own choice." If he be a 
man of common sense, by this time he will see bis own 
absurdity : for he must needs see that bis notion or con- 
ception, even of this liberty, does not contain any judg- 

• lAqairy, pp. 40—45, 1113, J94, 887—397, 310, 3i7, 33(h-346' 



419 

ment or conception how he conies by that choice wbieb 
first determines his pleasure/ or which originally fixed his 
own will respecting the affair. Or if any shall say, " That 
a man exercises liberty in this, even in determining his 
own choice, but not as he pleases, or not in consequence 
of any choice, preference, or inclination of his own, but 
by a determination arising contingently out of a state of 
absolute indifference ;" this is not rising higher in his 
conception of liberty ; as such a detern[)i nation of the 
will would not be a voluntary determination of it. Surely, 
he that places liberty in a power of doing something not 
aecording to his own choice, or from his choice, has not 
a higher notion of it, than he that places it in doing as be 
pleases, or acting from his own election. If there were a 
power in the mind to determine itself, but not by its choice 
or according to its pleasure, what advantage would it give ; 
and what liberty worth contending for would be exerci- 
sed in it ? Therefore-, no Arminian^ Pelagian or Epicu- 
rean, can rise higher in his conceptions of liberty than 
the notion of it which I have explained : which notion is 
apparently, perfectly consistent with the whole of that 
necessity of men's actions which I suppose takes place. 
And I scruple not to say, it is beyond all their wits to in- 
vent a higher notion, or form a higher imagination of lib- 
erty ; let them talk of sovereignty of the willy self-deter^ 
mining power ^ self-motion^ self-direction, arbitrary decis' 
ion, liberty ad vtrumvis, power of choosing differently 
in given cases, etc. etc. as long as they will. It is appa- 
rent that these men, in their strenuous affirmation, and 
dispute about these thi-ngs, aim at they know not what, 
fighting for something they have no conception of, substi- 
tuting a number of confused, unmeaning words, instead 
of things and Instead of thoughts. They may be chal- 
lenged clearly to explain what they would have : they 
never can answer the challenge. 

The author of the Essays, through his whole essay on 
liberty and necessity, goes on that supposition, that in or- 
der to the being of real liberty, a man must have a free- 



490 

■ « 

dam that is opposed to moral Decessity : and yet be sup* 
'poses, p. 175, that suck a liberty must signify a power 
in the mind of acting wiilwiU and against motives^ a pow^ 
er of acting without any viewj purpose^ or desi^^ and 
even of acting in contradiction to our own desires and 
OffcrsionSf ana to all our principles of action;, and is em 
absurdity altogether inconsistent Ufith a rational nature* 
Now, who e^er imag'med such a liberty as this, a higher 
sort or degree of freedom, than a liberty of following one's 
own views and purposes, and acting agreeable to his owa 
inclinations and passions ? Who wiU ever reasonably sup- 
pose that liberty, which is an absurdity altogelher incon- 
sistent with a rational nature, to be a kind of liberty above 
that which is consistent with the nature of a rational, in- 
telligent, designing agent. 

The author of the Essays seems to suppose such a ne- 
cessity to take place as is inconsistent with some sup- 
posable pow£r of arbitrary choice ;* or that there is^ 
some liberty conceivable, whereby men's own actions 
might be more properly in their powER,t and by 
which events might be more dependent on ourselves ;^ 
contrary to what I suppose to be evident, in my Inquiry .^ 
What way can be imagined, of (far actions being more ifi 
our power, from ourselves, or dependent on ourselves^ 
than their being from our power to fulfil our own choice, 
to act from our own inclination, pursue our own views, 
and execute our own designs ? Certainly, to be able to 
act thus, is as properly having our actions in our power, 
and dependent on ourselves, as a being liable to be the 
subjects of acts and events, contingendy and fortuitously, 
without desire, view, purpose, or design, or any principle 
of action, within ourselves ; as we must be, according to 
this author's own declared sense, if our actions are per- 
formed with that liberty that is opposed to moral necessity. 

This author seems every where to suppose, that neces*- 
sity, most properly so called, attends all men's actions ; 

* Pa^e 169. t Pages 191, 195, 197, 206. 

X Page 183. § Pages 409, 410. 



aacf that the terms neeestary^ WMtvcidabU^ imponibte^ etc 
are equally applicable to the case of moral and natural 
necessity. In p. 173^ he says, The idea of necessary 
and unavoidable equally agrees, both, to moral andphynr 
cat necessity. And in p. 184, All things that fall ost^ 
in the natural and moral world are alike necessary, B. 
174, This inclination and choice is unavoidably caused 
or occasioned by the prevailing motive. In this lies t^ 
necessity of our actions, thu, in such circumstances, it 
iffos impossible toe could act otherwise. He often ex*> 
presses himself in like manner elsewhere, speaking ifi 
strong terms of men's actions as unavoidable, what they 
cannot forbear, liaving <no potrer over their own aetions^ 
the order of them being unalterably fixed, and inseparably 
linked together, etc.* 

On the contrary, I have largely declared, that the eon* 
nection between antecedent things and consequent oaea^ 
which takes place with regard to the acts of men's will% 
which is called moral necessity, is called by the name<iif 
necessity improperly; and that all such terms as mu^ 
cannot, impossible, unable, irresistible, unavoidable, it^ 
vincible, etc. when applied here, are not applied in their 
proper signification, and are either used nonsensically, and 
with perfect insignificance, or in a sense quite diverse from 
their original and proper meaning, and their use in com- 
mon speech :f and that such a necessity as attends tbe 
acts of men's wills, is more properly called certainty than 
necessity ; it being no other than the certain connection 
between the subject and predicate of the prof)osition which 
affirms their existence.;): 

Agreeable to what is observed in my Inquiry ,<^ I think 
it' is evidently owing to a strong prejudice in person's 
minds, arising from an insensible habitual perversion and 
misapplication of such*like terms as necessary, impossible,

tifia&/e« unavoidaNty inmnciblef etc. that they are ready 
to tbitik, that to suppose a certain connection of men's 
▼oiilions, witliout any foregoing motives or inclinations, or 
any preceding moral influence whatsoevei^ is truly and 
properly to suppose such a strong irrefragable chain of 
causes and effects, as stands in the way of, and makes ut* 
leriy vain, opposite desires and endeavors, like immovable 
aod impenetrable mountains of brass ; and impedes cor 
liberty like walls of adamant, gates of brass, and bars of 
iron ; whereas, all such representations suggest ideas fts 
fcr from the imth as ihe east is from the west. Nothing 
that I maintain, supposes that men are at all hindered by 
toy fatal necessity, from doing, and even willing and 
ehoosingy as they please, with full freedom ; yea, with 
the highest degree of liberty that ever was thought of, or 
that ever could possibly enter into the heart of any maa 
to conceive. 1 know it is in vain to endeavor to make 
some persons believe this, or at least fully and steadily to 
believe it : for if it be demonstrated to them, stilt the old 
prejudice remains, which has been long fixed by the use 
of the terms necessary^ musty cannot, imposribte, etc. ; the 
association with these terms of certain ideas inconsistent 
with liberty, is not broken, and the judgment is powerfully 
warped by it ; as a thing that has been long bent and 
grown stiff, if it be straightened, will return to its former 
curvity again and again. 

The author of the Essays most manifestly supposes, 
that if men had the truth concerning the real necessity of 
all their actions clearly in view, they would not appear 
to themselves, or one another, as at all praiseworthy or 
culpable, or under any moral obligation, or accountable 
for their actions:* which supposes that men are npt to 
be blamed or praised for any of their actions, and are not 
under any obligations, nor are truly accountable for any 
thing they do, by reason of this necessity ; which is very 
contrary to what I have endeavored to prove throughout 
the third part of my Inquiry. I humbly conceive it is

there sliown, that this is so far from the truth, that the 
moral necessity of men's actions, whicli truly take place, 
is requisite to the being of virtue and vice, or anything 
praiseworthy or culpable: that the liberty of indifference 
and contingence, which is advanced in opposition to that 
necessity, is inconsistent with the being of these ; as it 
would suppose that men are not determined in what they 
do by. any virtuous or vicious principles, nor act from any 
motives, intentions, or aims whatsoever ; or have any end, 
either good or bad, in acting. And is it not remarkable, 
that this author should suppose, that, in order to men's 
actions truly having any desert, they must be performed 
teiihout any view, purpose, design, or desire, or any 
principle of action, or anything agreeable to a rational 
nature 1 As it will appear that he does, if we compare 
pp. 206 and 207 with p. 175. 

The author of the Essays supposes, that God has deep* 
ly implanted in man's nature a strong and invincible ap- 
prehension, or feeling, as he calls it, of a liberty, and con- 
ttngence of his own actions, opposite to that necessity 
which truly attends them ; and which in truth does not 
agree with real fact,* is not agreeable to strict philosoph- 
ic truth,t< is contradictory to the truth of thin«/s,J and 
which truth contradicts,*^ not tallying ^vith the real plan:|| 
and that, therefore, such feelings are deceitfu],1F are in real- 
ity of the delusive kind.** He speaks of them as a wise d'e- 
lusion,ff as nice artificial feelings, merely that conscience 
may have a connmandinir power :%% meaning plainly, that 
these feelings are a cunning artifice of the Author of nature, 
to make men believe they are free when they are not.^^ 
He supposes that by these feelings, the moral world has a 
disguised appearance. |||| And other things of this kind he 
Says. He supposes, that all self-approbation and ail re-

connected wkh this way of thinking, all the ideas wbtcfa 
ai present are suggested by the words oughi^ skouUf 
arise from this delusion, and would entirely vanish with- 
out it.* 

All which is very contrary to what I have abundantly 
insisted on and endeavored to denKmstrate in my Inquiry ; 
where I have largely shown, that it is agreeable to the 
natural sense of mankind, that the moral necessity or cer- 
tainty that attends men's actions is consistent with praise 
and blame, reward and punishment ;f and that it is agree- 
able to our natural notions, that moral evil, with its de- 
sert of dislike and abhorrence, and all. its other ill deserv- 
ings, consists in a certain deformity in the nature of the 
dispositions and acts of ilie heart, and not in the evil of 
something else, diverse from these, supposed to be their 
cause or occasion 4 

I might well ask here, whether any one is to be found 
in the world of mankind, who is conscious to a sense or 
feeling, naturally and deeply rooted in his mind, that, in 
order to a man's performing any action that is praise or 
blameworthy, he must exercise, a liberty that implies and 
signifies a power of acting without any motive, view, de- 
sign, desire, or principle of action? For such a liberty, 
this author supposes, that roust be which is opposed to 
moral necessity, as I have already observed once and again« 
Supposing a man should actually do good, independent 
of desire, aim, inducement, principle, or end; is it a dic- 
tate of invincible natural sense, that his act is more meri- 
torious or praiseworthy, than if he liad performed it for 
some good end, and bad been governed in it by good 
principles and motives 7 and so 1 might ask on the con- 
trary, with respect to evil actions.^ 

The author of the Essays supposes that the liberty

without necessity, which we have a natural feeling of^ 
implies coniingence : and speaking of this contingence, be 
sometimes calls it by the name of chance. And it is evi* 
dent, that his notion of it, or rather what he says about it, 
implies things happening loosely y fortuitously^ by accident^ 
and without a cause,'* Now, I conceive the slightest reflec- 
tion may be sufficient to satisfy any one, that such a contin- 
gence of men's actions, according to our natural sense, is 
so far from being essential to the morality or merit of those 
actions, that it would deslroy it ; and that on the contrary, 
the dependence of our actions on such causes, as inward in- 
inclinations, incitements, and ends, is essential to the being 
of it. Natural sense teaches men, when they see anything 
done by others of a good or evil tendency, to inquire 
what their intention was : what principles and views they 
were moved by, in order to judge how far they are to be 
justified or condemned ; and not to determine, that, in 
order to their being approved or blamed at all, the ac- 
tion must be performed altogetlier fortuitously, proceed- 
ing from nothing, arising from no cause. Concerning this 
matter, 1 have fully expressed my mind in the Inquiry. f 
If the liberty, which we have a natural sense of as ne- 
cessary to desert, consists in the mind's self-determination, 
without beini( determined by previous inclination or mo- 
tive, then indifference is essential to it, yea, absolute in- 
difference ; as is observed in my Inquiry4 But men 
naturally have no notion of any such liberty as this, as 
essential to the morality or demerit of their actions ; but, 
on the contrary, such a liberty, if it were possible, would 
be inconsistent with our natural notions of desert, as is 
largely shown in the Inquir}'.<^ If it be agreeable to nat- 
ural sense, that* men must be indifferent in determining 
their own actions ; then, according to the same, the more

tbey are determined by incfinationy either good or bad, 
the less they have of desert : the more good actions are 
performed from good disposition, the less praiseworthy ; 
and the more evil deeds are from evil dispositions, the 
less culpable ; and, in general, the more men's actions 
are from their hearts, the less they are to be commended 
or condemned : which all must know is very contrary to 
natural sense. 

Moral necessity is owing to the power and government 
of the inclination of the heart, either habitOal or occasion- 
al, excited by motive: but, according to natural and com- 
mon sense, the more a man does anything with full incli- 
nation of )ieart, the more is it to be charged to his account 
for his condemnation, if it be an ill action, and the more 
to be ascribed to him for his praise, if it be gck>d. 

If the mind were determined to evil actions by contin- 
gence, from a slate of indifference, then, either there would 
be no fault in them, or else the fault would be in being so 

Cerfectly indifferent, that the mind was equally liable to & 
ad or good determination. And if this indifference be 
liberty, then the very essence of the blame or fault would 
lie- in the liberty itself, or the wickedness would, primari- 
ly and summarily, lie in being a free agent. If there 
were no fault in being indifferent, then there would be no 
fault in the determination's beincf ain^eable to such a state 
of indifference : that is, there could no fault be reasonably 
found with this, viz. that opposite determinations actually 
happen to take place indifferently^ sometimes good and 
sometimes bsTd, as continvence governs and decides. And 
if it be a fault to be indifferent to good and evil, tiien such 
indifference is no indifference to good and evil, but is a 
determination to evil, or to a fault; and such an mdiffer* 
ent dis|K>sition would be an evil, faulty disposition, ten- 
dency, or determination of mind. So inconsistent are 
these notions of liberty, as essential to praise or blame.

sive sense of a liberty of contingence, to be, io truth, the 
foundation of all the labor, care and industry of mankind ;*

aod that if men's practical ideas had been formed an ike 
plan of universal necessity ^ the ignava ratio, the inactive 
doctrine of the Stoics^ tvottld have followed ; and thai . 
there would have been no room for forethought about 
futurity J or any sort of industry and care ;* plainly mi- 
implying, that in this case men would see and know that 
all their industry and care signi6ed nothing, was in vain, 
and to no purpose, or of no hene6t ; events being Gxed 
in an irrefragable chain, and not at all depending on their 
care and endeavor; as he explains himself, particularly, 
in the instance of men's use of means to prolong life :f not 
orily very contrary to what F largely maintain in ray In- 
quiry, X but also very inconsistently with his own scheme, 
in what he supposes of the ends for which God has so 
deeply implanted this deceitful feeling in man's nature ; 
in which he manifestly supposes men's care and industry 
not to be in vain and of no bene6t, but of great use, yea, 
of absolute necessity, in order to the obtaining the most 
important ends and necessary purposes of human life, and 
to fulfil the ends of action to the best advantage ; as be 
largely declares.<5> Now, how shall these things be re- 
conciled ? That, if men had a clear view of real truths 
they would see that there was no room for their care and 
industry, because they would see it to be in vain, and of 
no benefit ; and yet that God, by having a clear view of 
real truth, sees that their being excited to care and indus* 
try will be of excellent use to mankind, and greatly for 
the benefit of the world, yea, absolutely necessary in or- 
der to it : and that therefore the great wisdom and good- 
ness of God to men appears, in arlAilly contriving to put 
them on care and industry for tlieir good, which good 
could not be obtained without them ; and yet both these 
things are maintained at once, and in the' same sentences 
and words by this author. The very reason he, gives, 
why God has put this deceitful feeling into men, contra- 
dicts and destroys itself; that God in his great goodness 

• Page 189. f Pages 184, 185. % Especially part iy. sect, v, 

{ Pages 188— lOdf and in many other places. 



' 428 

to men gave them such a deceitful feeling, because it was 
very useful and necessary for them, and greatly for their 
benefit, or excites them to care and industry for their own 
good, which care and industry is useful and necessary to 
that end :* and yet the very thing that this great benefit of 
care and industry is given as a reason for, is God's deceiv* 
ing men in this very point, in making them think their 
care and industry to be of great benefit to them, when in* 
deed it is of none at all ; and if they saw the real truth, 
they would see all their endeavors to be wholly useless, 
that there was no room for them, and that the event does 
not at all depend upon them.* 

And besides, what this author says, plainly implies (as 
appears by what has been already observed), that it is 
necessary men should be deceived, by be ng made to be- 
lieve that future events are contingent, and their own fu- 
ture actk»ns free, with such a freedom as signifies that 
their actions are not the fruit of their own desires, or de- 
signs, but altogether contingent, fortuitous, and without a 
cause. But how should a notion of liberty, consisting in 
accident or loose chance, encourage care and industry? 
I should think it would rather entirely discourage every 
thing of this nature. For surely, if our actions do not de- 
pend on our desires and designs, then they do not depend 
on our endeavors, flowing from our desires and designs. 
This author himseff seems to suppose, that if men had in- 
deed such a libeity of contingence, it would render all en- 
deavors to determine or move men's future volitions in 
vain : he says, that, in this case, to exhorty to instruct ^ to 
promise, or to threaten, would be to no purpose.f Why ? 
Because (as he himself gives the reason) then our will 
would- be capricious and arbitrary, and toe should be 
throum loose altogether, and our arbitrary power covld 
do tit good or ill only by accident. But if such a loose 
fortuitous state would render vain others' endeavors upon 
us, for the same reason would it make useless our endea- 
vors on ourselves: for events tliat are truly contingent 

• Ptj^et 188, 189, «te. rp^ges 17872137214^ 



% 

and accidental, and altogether loose from and independept 
of all foregoing causes, are independent on every forego- 
log cause within ourselves, as well as in others. 

I suppose Uiat it is so far from being true, that our 
minds are naturally possessed with a notion of such liber- 
ty as this, so strongly that it is impossible to root it out, 
that indeed men have no such notion of liberty at all, and 
that it is utterly impossible, by any means whatsoever, to 
implant or introduce such a notion into the mind. As no 
such notions as imply self-contradiction and self-abolition 
can subsist in the mind, as I have shown in my Inquiry ;** 
I think a mature, sensible consideration of the matter, 
sufficient to satisfy any one, that even the greatest and 
most learned advocates themselves for liberty of indiffer- 
ence ^nd self-determination, have no such notion ; and 
that indeed they mean something wholly inconsistent with, 
and directly subversive of, what they strenuously affirm, 
and earnestly contend for. By a man's having a power 
of determining his own will they plainly mean a power 
of determiniug his will as he pleases, or as he chooses ; 
whicb supposes that the mind has a choice, prior to its 
going about to confirm any action or determination to it. 
And if tliey mean that they determine even the original or 
prime choice, by their own pleasure or choice, as the thing 
that causes and directs it ; I scruple not most boldly to af- 
firm that they speak they know not what, and that of 
which they have no manner of idea ; because no such con- 
tradictory notion can come into, or have a moment's sub- 
sistence in, the mind of any man living, as an original or 
first choice beinm caused, or brought into being, by choice. 
After all, they say, they have no higher or other concep- 
tioB of liberty, than that vulgar notion of it, which I con- 
tend for, viz. a man's having power or opportunity to do 
as he chooses : or if they bad a notion that every act of 
cboice was determined by choice, yet it would destroy

their notion of the contingence of choice; for then no one 
act of choice would arise contingently, or from a state of 
indifference, but every individual act, in all the series, 
would arise from foregoing bias or preference, and from a 
cause predetermining and fixing its existence ; which in- 
troduces at once such a chain of causes and effects, each 
preceding link decisively fixing the following, as they 
would by all means avoid. 

And such kind of delusion and self-contradiction as thisy 
does not arise in men's minds by nature ; it is not owing 
to any natural feeling which God has strongly fixed in 
the mind and nature of man ; but to false philosophy, and 
strong prejudice, from a deceitful abuse of words. It is 
artificial ; not in the sense of the author of the Eissays, 
supposing it to be a deceitful artifice of God ; but artificial 
as opposed to natural, and as owing to an artificial, deceit- 
ful management of terms, to darken and confound the 
mind. Men have no audi thing when they fii-st begin to 
exercise reason ; but must have a great deal of time to 
blind themselves with metaphysical confusion, before they 
can embrace and Test in such definitions of liberty as are 
given, and imagine they understand them. 

On the whole, I humbly conceive, that whosoever will 
give himself the trouble of weighing what I have offered 
to consideration in my Inquiry, must be sensible, that such 
a moral necessity of men's actions as I maintain, is not at 
all inconsistent with any liberty that any creature has, or 
can have, as a free, accountable, moral agent, and subject 
of moral government ; and that this moral necessity is so 
far from being inconsistent with praise and blame, and the 
benefit and use of men's own care and labor, that, on the 
contrary, it implies the very ground and reason, why men's 
actions are to be ascribed to them as their own,nn that 
manner as to infer desert, praise and blame, approbation 
and remorse of conscience, reward and punishment ; and 
that it establishes the moral system of the universe, and 
God's moral government, in every respect, with the prop* 



431 

er use of motives, exhortations, commands, counsels, prom- 
ises, and threatenings ; and the use and beneGt of endeav- 
ors, care, and industry : and that therefore there is no 
need that the strict philosophic truth should be at all con^ 
cealed from men ; no danger in cantemplation and pro* 
found discovery in these things. So far from this, that 
the truth in this matter is of vast importance, and extreme- 
ly needful to be known ; and that the more clearly and 
perfectly the real fact is known, and the more constantly 
It is in view, the better; and particularly that the clear 
and full knowledge of that, which is the true system of 
the universe, in these respects, would greatly establish 
the doctrines which teach the true Christian scheme of 
Divine administration in the city of God, and the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, in its most important articles; and that 
these things never can be well established, and the oppo- 
site errors, so subversive of the whole Gospel, which at 
this day so greatly and generally prevail, be well confuted, 
or the arguments by which they are maintained answered, 
till these points are settled : while this is not done, it is, 
to me, beyond doubt, that the friends of those great Gos- 
pel truths will but poorly maintain their controversy with 
the adversaries of those truths : they will be obliged often 
to dodge, shufBe, hide, and turn their backs : and the lat- 
ter will have a strong fort, from whence they never can 
be driven, and weapons to use, which those whom they 
oppose will find no shield to screen themselves from ; and 
tbey will always puzzle, confound, and keep under the 
friends of sound doctrine ; and glory and vaunt themselves 
ID their advantage over them ; and carry their affairs with 
a high hand, as they have done already for a long time 
past. 

I conclude, sir, with asking your pardon for troubling 
you with so much said in vindication of myself from the 
imputation of advancing a scheme of necessity, of a like 
nature with that of the author of the <^ Essays on the 
Principles of Morality and Natural Religion.'' Consider- 



432 

ing that what I have said is not only in vindication of mjH 
self, but, as I think, of the most important articles of mor* 
al philosophy and religion ; 1 trust in what i know of 
your candor, that you will excuse 

Your obliged friend and brother,
