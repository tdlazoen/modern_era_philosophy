Crichoffs in WMu Russia, JamuryilTfn^y/ 

Among the various species 07* 
modifications of liberty, of which 
on different occasions we have heard 
s6' much in England^ I do not re- 
collect ever seeing anjr thing yet of- 
fered in behalf of the liberty of mak^ 
ing one's own terms in money-bargains. 
From so general and universal a ne»

as you well know^ that this meek and 
unassuming species of liberty has beei^ . 
suffering much injustice.

Igi' k word, the proposition I have 

been accustomed to lay down to my-

^ •.'*•. one, viz. that^o man 6f ripe years and

his eyes open, might to be hindered, with 
a view to his advantage, from making 
such bargain, in the way of obtaining 
money, ^ he thinks fit : nor, (what is a 
necessary consequence) amf body hin^ 
dered from supplying him, upon any 
terms he thinks prop^ to accede to. 

This proposition, were it to be re- 
ceived, would level, you see, at one

which we must also add arportion of 
the multifarious, and as Iittte>heard-

On this occasion, were it any indU

my part would be a smooth and ea^ 
one. '* You, who fetter cOntraotss

This^ I say, would be a short and

In favour of the restraints opposed

LETTER II. 

Seasons for Restraint. — Prevention of 

Usury. 

I Will begin with the prevention of 
usury: because in the sound of the 
word usury lies> I take it, the main 
strength of the argument : or, to speak 
strictly, of what is of more import- 
ance than all argument, of the hold 
which the opinion I am. combating 
has obtained on the imaginations and 
passions of mankind. 

Usury is a bad thing, and as such 
ought to be prevented: usurers are a 
bad sort of men, a very bad sort of 
men, and as such ought to be punish- 
ed and suppressed. These are among 

the 



Prevention of Usury. 7 

the string of propositions which every 
man finds handed down to him from 
his progenitors: whieh most men are 
disposed to accede to without exami- 
nation, and indeed not unnaturaily 
nor even unreasonably disposed, for 
it is impossible the bulk of mankind 
should find leisure, bad they the abi- 
lity, to examine into the grounds of 
an hundredtb part of the rules and 
maxims, which they find themselves 
obliged to- act upon. Very good apo^ 
logy this for John Trot: but a little 
more inquisitiveness maybe required, 
of legislators. 

You, my friend, by whom the true 
force of words is so well understood, 
have, I am sure, gone before me in 
perceiving, that to say usury is a 
thing to be ' prevented, is neither 
more nor less than begging the mat* 
ter ia question. I know of but two 

definitions 



S Lett. II. Reasom far Restraint. 

m 

definitions that can possibly be given 
of usury; one is, the taking of a 
greater interest than the law allows 
of: this may be styled the political 
or legal definition. The other is the 
taking of a greater interest than it is 
usual for men to give] and take : this 
may be styled the moral one: and 
this, where the law has not interfered, 
is plainly enough the only one. ' It is 
plain, that in order for usury to be 
prohibited by law, a positive descrip- 
tion must have ^been found for it by 
law, fixing, or rather superseding, 
the moral one. To say then that 
usury is a thing that ought to be 
prevented, is sa3ring neither more nor 
less, than that the utmost rate of in- 
terest which shall be taken ought to 
be fixed; and that fixation enforced 
by penalties, or such other means, 
if any, as may answer the purpose of 

preventing 



Prevention of Usury. 9 

preventing the breach of it. A law 
punishing usury supposes^ therefore, 
a law fixing the allowed legal rate of 
interest : and the propriety of the pe* 
nal law must depend upon the pro- 
priety of the simply-prohibitive, or, 
if you please, declaratory, one. 

One thing then is plain ; that, an- 
tecedently to custom growing from 
convention, there can be no such 
thing as usury : for what rate of in- 
terest is there that can naturally be 
more proper than another ? what na« 
tural fixed price can there be for the 
use of money more than for the use of 
any other thing? Were it not then 
for custom, usury, considered in a 
moral view, would not then so much 
fis admit of a definition : so far from 
having existence, it would not so 
much as be conceivable: nor there- 
fore could the law, in the definition 

B 3 it 



10 Lett, II. Brasons for Restraint. 

it took upoD itself to give of such 
offence, have so much as a guide to 
steer by. Custom therefore is the 
sole basis, which, either the moralist 
in his rules and precepts, or the le- 
gislator in his injunctions, can have 
to build upon. But what basis can 
be more weak or unwarrantable, as a 
ground for coercive measures, than 
custom resulting from free choice ? 
My neighbours, being at liberty, have 
liappened to concur among them- 
selves in dealing at a certain rate of 
interest. I, who have money to lend, 
and Titius, who wants to borrow it 
of me» would be glad, the one of us 
to accept, the other to give, an in- 
terest somewhat higher than theirs: 
why is the liberty they exercise to b» 
maite a pretence for depriving me and 
TttiuE of ours f 

Nor 



Prevention qf Usury. 1 1 

Nor has blind custom^ thus made 
the sole and arbitrary guide^ any 
thing of steadiness or uniformity ia 
its decisions ' it has varied^ from age 
to age, in the same country: it Ta-* 
ries, from country to country, in the 
same age : and the legal rate has va- 
ried along with it : and indeed, with 
regard to times past, it is from the 
legal rate, more readily than from 
any other source, that we collect the 
customary. Among the Romans, till 
the time of Justinian, we find it as 
high 'as 12 per cent.: in England, so 
late as the time of Henry VI IL, we 
find it at 10 per cent. : succeeding 
statutes reduced it to 8, then to 6, 
and lastly to 5, where it stands at 
present. Even at present in Ireland 
it is at 6 per cent. ; and in the West* 
Indies at 8 per cent; and in Hin- 
dostan, where tliere is no rate limited 

by 



IS Lett. II. Reasons/or Restraint. 

by law, the lowest caatomary rate is 
10 or 12, At Constantinople, ia cer- 
tain cases, as I have been well in- 
formed, thirty per cent, is a com- 
mon rate. Now, of ail these widely 
different rates, what one is there, that 
is intrinsically more proper than aoo- 
ther? What is it that evidences this 
propriety in each instance ? what but 
the mutual convenience of the par- 
ties, as manifested by their consent? 
It is convenience then that has pro- 
duced whatever there has been of cus- 
tom in the matter: "What can there 
then be in custom, to make it a bet- 
ter guide than the convenience which 
gave it birth ? and what is there in 
convenience, that should make it a 
worse guide in one case than in ano- 
ther ? It would be convenient to me 
to give' 6 per cent, for money: I 
wish to do so. " No," (says the law) 
" you

you shan't." — Why so ? " Because 
it lis not convenient to your neigh- 
bour to give above 5 for it." Can 
any thing be more absurd than such 
a reason ? 

Much has not been ''done^ I thinks 
hy legislators as yet in the way of fix- 
ing the price of other commodities: 
and, in what little has been done^ 
the probity of the intention has, I 
believe, in general, been rather more 
unquestionable than the rectitude of 
the principle, or the felicity of the 
result. Putting money out at interest, 
is exchanging present money for fu- 
ture : but why a policy, which, as 
applied to exchanges in general^ 
would be generally deemed absurd 
and mischievous, should be deemed 
necessary in the instance of this par- 
ticular kind of exchange, mankind 
are as yet to learn. For him wha 

takes 



14 Lett. II. Reasons for RestrainL 

tftkes as much as be caa get for the 
use of aay other sort of things an. 
house for instance^ there is no parti- 
cular appellation, nor any mark of 
disrepute : nobody is ashamed of do- 
ing so^ nor is it usual so much as to 
profess to do otherwise. Why a man 
\vho takes as much as he can get^ be 
it six, or seven, or eight, or ten per 
cent, for the use of a sum of money, 
should be called usurer, should be 
loaded with an opprobrious name, any 
more than if he had bought an house 
with it, and made a proportionable 
profit by the house, is more than I can 
see. 

Another thing I would also wish 
to learn, is, why the legislator should 
be more anxious to limit the rate of 
interest one way, than the other? 
why he should set his face against the 
owners pf that species of property 

more 



PreoerUian of Usury. 15 

more than of any other? why he 
should make it his business to prevent 
their getting more than a certain price 
for the use of it^ rather than to prevent 
their getting less? why, in short, he 
should not take means for making it 
penal to offer less, for example, than 
5 per cent, as well as to accept more ? 
Let any one that can, find an answer 
to these questions; it is more than I 
can do: I except always the distant 
and imperceptible advantage, of sink- 
ing the price of goods of all kinds; 
aaad, in that remote way, multiplying 
the future enjoyments of individuals^ 
But this was a consideration by far too 
distant and refined, to ha^e been the 
original ground for confining the limi- 
tation to this side^

LETTER III. 

Reasons for Restraint. — Prevention of 

Prodigality. 

Having done with sounds^ I come 
gladly to propositions j which, as far 
as they are true in point of fact, may 
deserve the name of reasons. And 

4 

first, as to the e£Scacy of such restric- 
tive laws with regard to the prevention 
of Prodigality. 

That prodigality is a bad thing, 
and that the prevention of it is a pro- 
per object for the legislator to propose 
to himself, so long as he confines him- 
self to, what I look upon as, proper 
measures, I have no objection to allow, 
at least for the purpose of the argu- 
ment^ 



Prevention of Prodigality. 17 

ment j though, were this the principal 
question, I should look upon it as in- 
cumbent on me to place in a fair light 
the reasons there may be for doubting^ 
how far, with regard to a persua arriv- 
ed at the age of discretion, third per- 
sons may be competent judges ; which 
of two pains may be of greater force 
and value to him, the present pain of 
restraining his present desires, or the 
future conjiingent pain he may be ex- 
posed to suffer from the want to which 
the expense of gratifying these desires 
may hereafter have reduced him. To 
prevent our doing mischief to one 
another, it is but too necessary to put 
bridles into all our mouths : it is ne«^ 
cessary to the tranquillity and very be- 
ing of society : but that the tacking 
of leading-strings upon the backs of 
grown persons, in order to prevent 
their doing themselves a mischief, is 

not 



18 Lett. III. Reasons for Restraint. 

not necessary either to the being or 
tranquillity of society, however con- 
ducire to its well-being, I think can- 
not be disputed. Such paternal, or, if 
you please, maternal, care, may be a 
good work, but it certainly is but a 
work of supererogation. 

For my own part, I must confess, 
that so long as such niethods only are 
employed, as to me appear proper ones, 
and such there are, I should. not feel 
myself disinclined to see some measures 
taken for the restraining of prodigality : 
but this I cannot look upon as being 
of the number. My reasons I will 
DOrW endeavour to lay before you. 

In the first plaee, I take it, that it 
is neither natural nor usual for prodi- 
gals, as such, to betake themselves to 
this method, I mean, that of giving 
a rate of interest above the ordinary 

one^ to supply their wants. 

In 



Prevention of Prodigality. 1 9 

In the first place, no man, I hope 
you will allow, prodigal or not prodi-* 
gal, ever thinks of borrowing money 
to spend, so long as he has ready money 
of his own, or effects which he can 
turn into ready money without loss. 
And this deduction strikes off what,,. 
I suppose^, you will look upon as the 
greatest, proportion of tl^e persons, 
subject, at any given tioie, to the im-^ 
yy^tatil^n of prodigality. 

In the next place, no mam, in such 
a country a& Great Britain at least, 
has occasion, nor is at aU likely, ta 
take up money at an extraordinary 
rate of interest, who has security to 
give, equal to that upon which money 
rs commonly to be had at thie highest 
ordinary rate« While so many ad- 
vertise^ as are to be seen every day 
advertising, money to be lent at five 
per cent* what should possess a man^ 

who 



so Lett* III. Reasons for RestrainL 

who has any thing to offer that can 
be called a security, to give, for ex- 
ample^ six per cent, is more than I 
can conceive. 

You may say, perhaps, that a man 
who wishes to lend his money out up- 
on security, wishes to have his inter- 
est punctually, and that without the 
expense, and hazard, and trouble, 
and odium of going to law ; and 
that, oix this account, it is better to 
have a sober man to deal with than a 
prodigal. So far I allow you 5 but 
were you to add, that on this ac- 
count it would be necessary for a pro- 
digal to offer more than another man, 
there I should disagree with you. In 
the first place, it is not so easy a thing, 
nor, I take it, a common thing, for 
the lender upon security to be able to 
judge, or even to form any attempt 
to judge, whether the conduct of 

one 



Pirtoention of Prodigality. t\ 

oae who offers to borrow his money 
13 or is not of such a cast, a$ to bring 
him under this description. The 
question, prodigal or not prodigal, 
depends upon two pieces of informa- 
tion ; neither of which, in general^ 
is ve^ easy to come at : on the one 
hand, the amount of his means and 
reasonable expectations $ on the other 
hand, the amount of his expenditure^ 
The goodness or badness of the se- 
curity is a question of a very differ- 
ent nature : upon this head, every 
man has a known and ready means of 
obtaining that sort of information, 
which is the most satisfactory the na- 
ture of things affords, by going to 
his lawyer. It is accordingly, I take 
it, on their lawyer's opinion^ that 
lenders in general found their deterr 
mination in these cases, and not upon 
Any calculations they may have form^

ed> concerniog the receipt and vs^ea- 
diture of the borrower. Bat even 
supposing a man's dispositioB to pro- 
digality to be ever so well ktiowD, 
there are always eaongh to be fband, 
to whom anch a disposition would be 
rather an ioducemeat than an <i»bjec- 
tion, so long as they were satisfied 
. with the security. Every body knows 
the advantage to be made io case of 
mortgage, by foreclosing or forcing a 
sale: and that this advantage is not 
uncommonly looked out for, will, I 
believe, hardly be doubted by any 
«ne, who has had any occasion to ob- 
serve the conrse of bnstness in the 
court of Chancery. 

Id short, so long as a prodigal has 
any thing to pledge, or to dispose of, 
whether in possession, or even in re- 
version, whether of a certain or even 
of a contingent nature, I see not, 
how 



Prevention of Prodigality.- 38 

how he can receive the smallest beaoe- 
£t, from any laws that .are, or can be 
made to fix the rate of interest. For» 
suppose the Jaw to be efficacious as 
far as it goes^ and that the prodigal 
can find none of those monsters called 
tisuriers to deal with him^ does he lie 
quiet? No such thing; he ^oes on 
end gets the money he wants» by sd- 
ling his interest instead of borrow* 
ing. He goes on, I say: for if he. has 
prudence enough to stop him apy 
where, he is not that sort of man^ 
whom it can be worth while for the law 
to attempt stopping by such meansL 
It is plain enough then, that to a 
prodigal thus circumstanced, the law 
cannot be-of any service ; on the con? 
trary , it may, and in many :cases must^ 
be of disservice to him, by denying 
him the option of a resource, which, 
how disadvantageous soever, could 

not

24 Lett, III. Reasons for Restraint. 

not well have proved more so^ but 
would naturally have proved less so, 
than those which it leaves still open 
to him. But of this hereafter. 

I now come to the only remaining 
class of prodigals, viz. those who have 
nothing that can be called a security to 
offer. These, I should think, are not 
more likely to get money upon an ex- 
traordinary rate of interest, than an or* 
dinary one. Persons who either feel, 
or find reasons for pretending to feel, 
a friendship for the borrower, can not 
take of him more than the ordinary 
rate of interest : persons who have no 
such motive for lending him, will not 
lend him at all. If they know him 
for what he is^ that will prevent them 
of course: ami e^n though they 
should know nothing of him by any 
other circumstance, the very circum- 
stance of his not being able to find a 

friend 






Preveniion of Prodigality. 25 

friend to trust him at the highest or- 
'dinary rate, will be sufficient reason to 
a stranger for looking upon him as a 
man, who, in the judgment of his 
friends, is not likely to pay. 

The way that prodigals run into 
debt, after they have spent their sub- 
stance, is, I take it, by borrowing of 
their friends and acquaintance, at or* 
dinary interest, or mx)re commonly at 
no interest^ small sums, such as each 
man may be content to lose, or be 
ashamed to ask real security for; and 
^s prodigals have generally an exten- 
sive acquaintance ( extensive acquaint- 
ance being at once the cause and effect 
of prodigality), the sum total of the 
money a man may thus find means to 
squander, may be considerable, tho' 
^ach sum borrowed may, relatively to 
the circumstances of the lender, have 
)been inconsiderable. This I take to 

c be

he the race which prodigals, who have 
spent their all, run at present, under 
the present system of restraining laws: 
and this, and no other, I take it, would 
be the race they would run^ were those 
laws out of the way. 

Another consideration there is, I 
think, which will compleat your con* 
viction,'if it was not compleat be* 
fore^ of the inefficacy of these laws, 
as to the putting any sort of restraint 
upon prodigality. This is, that there 
is another set of people from whom 
prodigals get what they want, and al- 
ways will get it, so long as credit lasts, 
in spite of all laws against high in* 
terest; and, should they find it neces- 
sary, at an expense more than equal 
to an excess of interest they might 
otherwise have to give. I mean the

triple interest, 15 per cent.: in the 
way of trading, then, a man can a& 
ford to be at least three times as ad>> 
venturous, as he can in the way of 
lending, and with equal prudenoe.

was accustomed to deal with in his 
solvent days, he sees a person who 
may accept of any rate of profit, 
without the smallest danger from any 
laws that are, or can be made against 
usury. How idle, then, to think of 
stopping a man from making six, or 
seven, or eight per cent, interest,

portionable.

portionable, he may in this way make 
thirty or forty per cent, or any ratd 
you please. And as to the prodigal, 
if he cannot get what he wants upon 
these terms^ what chance is there of 
his getting it upon any terms^ sup- 
posing the }aws against usury to be 
away ? This then is another way, in 
which, instead of serving, it injures 
him, by narrowing his option, and 
driving him from a market which 
might have proved less disadvantage- 
ous, to a more disadvantageous one. 

As far as prodigality, then, is con* 
cerhed, I must eonfess, I cannot see 
the use of stopping the current of ex- 
penditure in this way at the fosset, 
when there are so many unpreventa- 
ble ways of letting k run out at the 
bung-hole.

much money drop at ooce out of the 
pockets of the prodigal, who would 
hare gone on wasting it, into the till 
of the frugal tradesman, who will lay 
it up, is not worth the inquiry for 
the present purpose : what is plain is, 
that, so lar as the saving the pro- 
digal from paying at an extraordinary 
rate for what he gets to spend, is the 
object of the law, that object is not 
«t all promoted, by 6xing the rate of 
interest upon money borrowed. Oa 
the contrary, if the law has any ef- 
fect, it runs, counter to that object: 
tioce, were he to borrow, it would 
only he, in, as far as ,he could borrow 
at a rate inferior to that at which 
Otherwise he would be obliged to buy, 
Preventiog his borrowing at an extra- 
rate, may have the' effect of increasing 
l)is distress, but cannot have the effect 
of lesseniug it : allowing his bCtrrowing

at such a rate» might have the effect 
of lessening his distress, but could not 
have the effect of increasing it. 

To put a stop to prodigality, if in- 
deed it be worth while, I know but 
of one effectual course thai can be 
taken, in addition to the incompleat 
and insufficient courses at present 
pisacticable, and that is, to put the 
convicted prodigal under an inierdicty 
as was practised formerly among the: 
Romans, and is still practised among 
the French, and other nations who* 
have taken the Roman law for the 
ground-work of their own. Bot to 
discuss the expediency, or sketch out. 
the details of such an institution, be* 
longs not to the present purpose.

Reasons for Restraint. — Protection of 

Indigence. 

Besides prodigah^ there are 
three other classes of persons^ and 
but three^ for whose security I can 
conceive these restrictive laws to have 
been designed. I mean the indigent^ 
the rashly enterprizing^ and the sim- 
ple : those whose pecuniary necessities 
may dispose them to give an interest 
above the ordinary rate^ rather than 
hot have it, and those who, from rash- 
ness, may be disposed to venture upon 
giving such a rate, or from careless- 
ness combined with ignorance, may 
be disposed to acquiesce in it. 

In 



Protection of Indigence. 33 

In speaking of these three different 
classes of persons, I must beg leave to 
coiisider one of them at a time : and 
accordingly, in speaking of the^ indi>- 
gent, I must consider indigence in the 
first place as untinctured with simpli- 
city. On this occasion, I may sup- 
pose, and ought to suppose, no parti- 
cular defect in a man's judgment, or 
his temper^ that should mislead him, 
more than the ordinary run of men. 
He knows what is his interest as 
well as they do, and is as well dis^ 
posed and able to pursue it as they are. 

I have already intimated^ what I 
think is undeniable, that there are 
no one or two or other limited num- 
ber of rates of interest, that can be 
equally suited to the unlimited num- 
ber of situations, in respect of the de- 
gree oi exigency y in which a man is li- 
able to find himself :. insomuch- that 

C3 to 



34 Lett. IV. Seasons for Restraint 

to the situation of a man, who by the 
use of money can make for example 
11 per cent., six per cent, is as well 
adapted, as 5 per cent, is to the situ* 
ation of him who can make but 10 ; 
to that of him who can make 12 per 
cent, seven, and so on. So, in the case 
of his wanting it to save himself from 
a loss, (which is that which is most 
likely to be in view under the name 
of exigency J if that loss would amount 
to 1 1 per cent. 6 per cent, is as well 
adapted to his 'situation, as 5 per 
cent, would be to the situation of 
him, who had but a loss amounting 
to ten per cent, to save himself from 
by the like means. And in any case, 
though, in proportion to the amount 
of the loss, the rate of interest were 
even so great, as that the clear saving 
should not amount to more than one 
per cent, or any fraction per cent, yet 

so 



Protection of Indigence. 9& 

so long as it amounted to any thingj^ 
he would be just so much the better 
for borrowings even on such compa* 
ratively disadvauti^eous terms. If^ 
instead of gain^ we put any other 
kind of benefit or advantage — if^ in- 
stead of loss> we put any other kind 
of mischief or inconvenience^ of equal 
Talue> the result will be the same. 

A man is in one of these situations^ 
suppose, in which it would be for his 
lidvantage to borrow^ But his cir« 
cumstances are such, that it would 
pot be worth any body's while to lend 
him, at the highest rate which it is 
proposed the law should allow i ia 
short) he cannot get it at that rate. If 
he thought he catdd get it at that rate^, 
most surely he would not give a 
higher : he may be trusted for that ^ 
£[>r by the supposition he has nothing 
defective ia his understandings But 

thfib 



36 Lett. IV. Reasons for Restraint. 

the fact is, he cannot get it at that 
lower rate. At a higher rate, how- 
ever, he could get it : and at that 
rate, though higher, it would be 
worth his while to get it : so he 
judges, who has nothing to hinder 
him from judging right ; who has 
every motive and every means for 
forming a right judgment ; who has 
every motive and every means for 
informing himself of the circum- 
stances, upon which rectitude of judg- 
ment, in the case in question, de- 
pends, The legislator^ who knows 
nothing, nor can know any thing, of 
any one of all these circumstances, 
who knows nothing at all about the 
matter, comes and says to him — ^^ It 
signifies nothing ; you shall not 
have the money : for it would be 
** doing you a mischief to let you 
*« borrow it upon such terms." — 

And

And this out of prudence and lov- 
ing-kindness ! — ^There may be worse 
Cruelty: but can there be greater 
folly? 

The folly of those who persist, as 
is supposed, without reason, in not 
taking advice, has been niuch expa* 
tiated upon. But the folly of those 
who persist, without reason, in forcing 
their advice upon others, has been 
but little dwelt upon, though it is, 
perhaps, the more frequent, and the 
more flagrant of the two. It is not 
often that one man is a better judge 
for another, than that other is for 
himself, even in cases were the ad- 
viser will take the trouble to make 
himself master of as many of the ma- 
terials for judging, as are within the 
reach of the person to be advised.

LETTER V. 

Reasons for Restraint — Protection of 

Simplicity. 

I Come, lastly, to the case of the 
simple. Here, in the first place, I 
think I am by this time entitled to 
observe, that no simplicity, short of 
absolute idiotism, can cause the in* 
dividual to make a more groundless 
judgment than the legislator, who 
in the circumstances above stated, 
should pretend to confine him to any 
given rate of interest, would have 
made for him. 

Another consideration, equally con* 
elusive, is, that were the legislator's 
judgment ever so much superior to 
the individuaFs, how weak soever 

that 



40 Lett, V, Reasons for Restraint. 

that may be, the exertion of it on this 
occasion can never be any otherwise 
than useless, so long as there are so ma- 
ny similar occasions, as there ever must 
be, where the simpUcity of the indi- 
vidual is equally likely to make him 
a sufferer, and on which the legisla- 
tor cannot interpose with effect, nor 
has ever so much as thought of 
interposingi 

Buying goods with money, or upon 
credit, is the business of every day : 
borrowing money is the business, on- 
ly, of some particular exigency, which, 
in comparison, can occur but seldom. 
Regulating the prices of goods in ge- 
neral would be an endless task, and no 
legislator has ever been weak enough 
to think of attempting it. And sup- 
posing he were to regulate the prices, 
what would that signify for the pro- 
tection of simplicity, unless he were 



Protection of Simplicity. 4 1 

to regulate also the quantum of what 
each man should buy? Such quan- 
tum is indeed regulated^ or rather 
means are taken to prevent buying 
altogether ; but in what cases ? la 
diose only where the weakness is ad- 
judged to have anrived at such a pitich, 
as to render a man utterly unqualified 
for the management of his affairs : in^ 
shorty when it has arrived at the lengtl^ 

of idiocy. 

• But in what degree soever a man^s 
weakness may expose him to imposi- 
tion, he stands much more exposed 
to it, in the way of buying goods, 
than in the way of borrowing money. 
To be informed, beforehand, of the 
ordinary prices of ail the sorts of 
things, a man may have occasion to 
buy, may be a task of considerable 
variety and extent. To- be informed 
of the ordinary rate of interest, is to 

be 



42 'Lett. V. Seasons for Restraint. 

be informed of one single fact, too in- 
teresting not to have attracted atten- 
tion, and too simple to have escaped 
the memory. A few per cent, en- 
bancement upon the price of goods, 
is a matter that may easily enough 
pass unheeded ^ but a single per cent, 
beyond the ordinary interest of money, 
is a stride more conspicuous and start- 
ling, than many per cent, upon the 
price of any kind of goods. 

Eren in regard to subjects, which, 
by their importance would, if any, 
justify a regulation of their price, 
such as for instance land, 1 question 
whether there ever was an instance 
where, without some such ground as, 
on the one side fraud, or suppression 
of facts necessary to form a judgment 
of the value, or at least ignorance of 
such facts, on the other, a bargain was 
rescinded, merely because a man had 
sold 



Protection of Simplicity. 43 

sold too cheap, or bought too dear.^ 
Were I to take a fancy to give a 
hundred years purchase instead of 
thirty, for a piece of land, rather 
than not have it, I don't think there 
is any court in England, or indeed 
any where else^ that would interpose 
to hinder me^ much less to punish 
the seller with the loss of three tifnes 
the purchase money, as in the case of 
usury. Yet when I had got my piece 
of land, and paid my money, repent- 
ance, were the law ever so well dis- 
posed to assist me, might be unavail- 
ing: for the seller might have spent 
the money, or gone off with it. But, 
in the case of borrowing money, it is 
the borrower always, who, according 
to the indefinite, or short term for 
which money is lent, is on the safe 
side: any imprudence he may have 
committed with regard to the rate 

of 



44 Lett. V. Reasons for RestrainL 

of interest, may be corrected at anjr 
time : if I find I have given too high 
an interest to one man, I have no 
inore to do than to borrow of another 
at a lower rate, and pay off the fi^rst : 
if I cannot find any body to lend me 
at a lower, there cannot be a more 
certain proof that the first was not in: 
reaUty too high. But of this hereafter.K

ISTTERVL 

Mischiefs of the anti-usurious Lotos. 

JN the preceding letters, I have ex* 
Binined all the modes I can think of> 
in which the restraints, imposed by 
the laws against nsnry, can have been 
fancied to be of service. 

I hope it appears by this time, that 
there are no ways in which those laws 
can do any good. Bat there are se»> 
vera], in which they can not bat do 
mischief. 

The first I shall mention, is that of 
precluding so many people, altoge- 
ther, from the getting the money they 
stand in need of, to answer their re- 
^spective exigencies^ Think what a 

distress 



46 Lett. VI. Mischitfs qf the 

distress it would produce, were the 
liberty of borrowing denied to every 
. body : denied to those who have such 
security to offer, as renders the rate 
of interest^ they have to offer, a suffi- 
cient inducement, for a man who has 
money, to trust them with it. 'Just 
that same sort of distress is produced, 
by denying that liberty to so many 
people, whose security, though, if 
they were permitted to add some- 
thing to that rate, it would be suffi- 
cient, is rendered insufficient by their 
being denied that liberty. Why the 
misfortune, of not being possessed of 
that arbitrarily exacted degree of se- 
curity, should be made a ground for 
subjecting a man to a hardship, which 
is not imposed on those who are free 
from that misfortune, is more than I 
can see. To discriminate the former 
class from the latter, I can see but 
this

this one circuiiisd»nce, viz. that their 
necessity is grepiter. This it is by the 
very supposition: for were it not^tbey 
could not ,be^ what they are supposed 
to he> willing to give more to be re« 
Itemed itovk it* In this point of view 
then^ the sole tendency of the law is^ 
to heap distress upon distress* 

A second mischi^ is, that of r^i* 
dering the terms so much the worse^ 
to a multitude of those, whose circum* 
stances exempt them from being pre^ 
eluded altogether from getting the 
money they have occasion for* In 
this case, the mischief, though nece9<» 
sarily less intense than in the other, is 
much more palpable and conspicuous* 
Those who cannot borrow may get 
what they want, so long as they have 
any thing to sell. But while, out of 
loving^ki0dness> or whatsoever other 
motiv«> the law precludes a man from 

borrowing.

Every body knows that forced sales 
are attended with a loss : and, to tfaiii

no proportion^ When a man's move- 
ables are taken in execution, they 
are, I believe, pretty well sold, if, 
after all expenses paid, the produce 
amounts to two-thirds of what it 
would cost to replace them. Id this 
way the providence and loving-kind- 
ness of the law costs him 33 per cent, 
and no more, supposing, what is sel- 
dom the case, that no more of the ef- 
fects are taken than what is barely 
necessary to make up the money due.

this case, any other expedient, than 
that of hiring a man to break his en- 
gagement, and to crush the hand that 
has been reached out to help him. Iii 
the case of informers in general, there 
iias been no troth pKghted, nor bene6t

but be manifest even to the criminal, 
is, that it is by the adherence to his

of such engagement, instead of doing 
jnischief he is doing good: in the 
case of usury this is what no man call 
^now, and what one can scarcely think 
it possible for any man, who, in the 
character of the borrower, has been 
coticerned in siich a transaction, td

is impossible any account should have 
been taken, it was indeed conformed 
to : in some of those instances, people

stained from lending altogether ; in 
others of those instaneesr, people lent 
their money at th6 reduced legal rate.

Having proved^ as I hope, by this 
time, the utter impropriety of the law*^ 
lianiting the rate of interest, in every 
case that can be conceived, it may be 
rather matter of curiosity, than any 
thing else, to inquire, how fhr the 
law, on this head, is consistent with ' 
itself, and with any principles upoii^ 
which it can have built. 

1. Drawing and re-drawing is a' 
practice, which it will be sufficient 
here to hint at. It is perfectly well 
known to all merchants, and may be 
so to all who are not merchants, by 
consulting Dr. Smith. In this way,

he has shewn how money may be, and 
has been^ taken up, at so high a rate^ 
as 13 or 14 per cent,; a rate nearly three 
times as high as the utmost which the 
law professes to allow. The extra in-* 
terest is in this case masked under the 
names of commission, and price of ex^ 
change* The commission is but small 
upon each loan, not more, I thinks 
than one half per cent. : custom having 
stretched so far but no farther, it might 
be thpught dangerous, pjerhaps, to 
venture upon any higher allowance 
tinder that name. The charge, being 
repeated a number of times in the 
course of the year, makes up in fre* 
quency what it wants in weight« The 
transaction is by this shift rendered 
more troublesome, indeed, but not 
less practicable, to such parties as are 
agreed about it. But if i^sury is good 
for merchants, I don't very well see 

what 



Usury allotved. 75 

what should make it bad for every- 
hody else. 

2. At this distance from all the 
fountains of legal knowledge^ I will 
n6l pretend^ to say> whether the prac* 
tice of selling accepted bills at an under 
value, would hold good against all at^ 
tacks. It strikes my recollection as a 
pretty common one, and I think it 
'could not be brought under any of 
the penal statutes against usury. The 
adequateness of the consideration 
might, for ought I knoWi» be attacked 
with success, in a court of equity; 
or, perhaps, if there were sufficient 
evidence (which the agreement of the 
parties might easily prevent) by an 
auction at common law, for money had 
and received. If the practice be really 
proof against all attacks, it seems to 
afford an effectual, and pretty com-

opinion, he should omit to do so, the 
blan^e will lie, not on my industry^ 
but on his negligence. 

These, it may be said^ should they 
even be secure and effectual evasions^ 
are still but evasions, and, if charge- 
able upon the law at all, are charge- 
able not as inconsistencies but as over- 
sights. Be it so. Setting these aside, 
then, as expedients practiced or practi-

beg leave to remind you of two 
others, practised from the day of its

^advantage. If there be a case in 
which the allowing of such extraor*

which is so particularly adapted to 
the situation of the lowest poor* that

admit, that the liberty which this 
branch of trade enjoys, is no more 
than what it is perfectly right it 
should enjoy. What I want to know 
is, what there is in the class of men, 
embarked in this trade, that should 
render beneficial to them, a liberty, 
which would be ruinous to every body 
else. Is it that sea adventures have 
less hazard on them than land adven- 
tures? or that the sea teaches those, 
who have to deal with it, a degree of 
forecast and reflection which has been 
denied to landmen ? 

It were easy enough to give farther 
and farther extension to this charge of 
inconsistency, by bringing under it 
the liberty given to insurance in all

It is one thing, to find reasons why 
it is fit a law should have been made : 
it is another to find the reasons why it

thing to justify a law: it is another 
thing to account for its existence. In 
the present instance, the former task, 
if the observations I have been trou-

sible one. The other, though not

that naturally presents itself upon all 
such occasions. The case is> that ia 
matters of law more especially, such is 
the dominion of authority over our 
minds, and such the prejudice it creates 
in favour of whatever institution it has 
taken under its wing^ that, after all 
manner of reasons that can be thought 
of, in favour of the institution, have 
been shewn to be insufficient^ we still 
cannot forbear looking to some unas- 
signable and latent reason for its effi*

In the conceptions of the more con- 
siderable part of those through whom 
our religion has been handed down to 
us, virtue, or rather godliness, which 
was an improved substitute for virtaej 
consisted in self-denial : not in self-de- 
nial for the sake of society, but of self- 
denial for its own sake. One pretty 
general rule served for most occasions: 
not to do what you had a mind to do; 
or, in other words, not to do what 
would be for your advantage. By 
this of course was meant temporal ad- 
vantage : to which spiritual advantage 
was understood to be in constant and

is what most men have a mind to do r 
because he who has money gets^ as far* 
as it goes, most other things that he

was to get money : indeed why should 
he, when he was not so much as ta 
keep what he had got already ? To 

lend money at interest, is to get mo- 
ney, or at least to try to get it : of 
course it was a bad thing to lend mo- 
ney upon such terms. The belter the 
terms, the worse it was to lend upon

the mother and the daughter chorch

By degrees, as old conceits gave 
place to new, nature so far prevailed, 
that the. objections to getting money 
in general, vf ere pretty well over-ruled : 
but still this Jewish way of getting it, 
was too odious to be endured. Chris* 
tians were too intent upon plaguing 
Jews, to listen to the suggestion of 
doing as Jews did, even though mo- 
ney were to be got by it. Indeed the 
easier method, and a method pretty 
much iuvvogue, was, to let the Jews

been, that it would be to no purpose 
for a man to try to get five per -cent.

contrive to get so much, there would 
be any harm in it. But the sages of

him by that law may be ever so much

never to fall short of them. So close 
is the combination thus formed be-

of expenditure,' that a disposition to 
' spend finds favour in the eyes even of 
those who know that a man's circum-

which he has fallen, throws the veil of 
^sompassion over his injustice. 

. The condition of the man of thrift 
is the reverse. His' lasting opulence 
procures him a share, at least, of the 
same envy, that attends the prodigal's 
transient display : but the use he makes 
of it procures him no part of the fa- 
vour which attends the prodigal. In 
the satisfactions he derives from that 
use, the pleasure of possession, and tl^e

Could there be any doubt of the dis- 
favour which attends the cause of the 
money-lender, in his competition with 
the borrower, and of the disposition 
of the public judgment to sacrifice the 
interest of the former to that of the 
latter, the stage would afford a com-

of it. It is the business of the drama* 
tist to study, and to conform to, the 
humours and passions of those, on the 
jpleasitig of whom he depends for his

whether, among all the instances in

which the former was not recom-

for compound interest is discounten-

sort of usury. That, without an ex- 
press stipulation, the law never gives 
it, I wdl remember : whether, in case 
t)f an express stipulation, the law al- 
lows it to be taken, I am not absolute-

that interest should become principaK 
At any rate, I think the law can- 
not well punish it under the name of 
usury.

If the^borrower pays the interest at

he -chooses rather to expend it: be ex- 
pects to receive it at the day, or what 
meant. the engf^ement? if he fails of 
receiving it, he is by so much a loser. 
The borrower, by paying it at the 
day, is no loser : if he does not pay it 
at the day, he is by so much a gainer : 
a pain of disappointment takes place 
in the case of the one, while no such 
pain takes place iu the case of the 
other. The cause of him whose con-

ferred to that of him whose conten- 
tion is to avoid a loss: contrary to the 
reasonable and useful maxim of that 
branch of the common law which has 
acquired the name of equity. The 
gain, which the law in its tenderness 
thus bestows on the defaulter, is an 
encouragement, a reward, which it 
holds out for breach of faith, for 
iniquity, for indolence, for negli* 
gence. . 

. The loss, which it thus throws up^ 
on the forbearing lender, is a punish- 
ment which at inflicts on him for his 
forbearance : the power which it gives 
him of avoiding that loss, by prose- 
cuting the borrower upon the instant 
of failure, is thus converted into a re- 
ward which it hdds out to him for his 
bard-heartedness and rigour. Man is

It may be iflipossible,* say you, H 
cpften is impossible, for the borrower 
to pay the interest at the d&y : and 
you say truly. What is the inference ? 
That the creditor should not have it in 
'his power to ruin the debtor for not 
paying at the day, and that he should 
receive a compensation for the loss oc^ 
casioned by such faihre.'-^l^e has it 
jn his power to ruin him, and he has 
it not in his power to obtain such 
tK>mpensation. The judge, were it 
possible for an arrested debtor to find 
-his way into a judge's chamber instead 
of a spunging-house, might award f^ 
proper respite, suited to the circum-

perhaps at the debtor's, perhaps ten 
times, perhaps a hundred times the 
amount of that satisfaction. Such is 
the result of this tenderness of the 
law. 

It is in consequence of such tender-

118 Lett. XIL Maintenance 

antique laws against what are called 
Maintenance and Champerty. 

To the head of Maintenance, I think 
you refer, besides other offences which 
are not to the present purpose, that 
of purchasings upon any terms, any 
Claim^ which it requires a suit at law, 
or in equity, to enforce. 

Champerty, which is but a particu^^ 
kr modification of this sin of MaiQte«> 
Qance, is, I think, the furnishing a 
man who has such a claim, with regard 
to a real estate, such money as he may 
have occasion for, to carry on such 
claiinf u^on the terms of receiving a 
part of the estate in case of success. 

What the penalties are for these 
offences 1 do not recollect, nor do I 
think it worth while hunting for themi 
though I have Blackstone at my elbow^ 
They are at any rate^ sufficiently se- 
vere

as the bargain is made vmdi 

To iliastrate the mischievQiiaiiesff of 
the laws by which they have bean 
created^ give me leave to tell yooa 
story, which is but to6 trae an one> 
and which happened to fall within my 
own observation. 

A gentleman of my acquaintance 
had succeeded, during his minority^ ta 
an estate of about 30001. a year : I 
won't say where. His guardian^ con- 
cealing from him the value of the 
estate, which circumstances rendered 
it easy for him to do, got a convey- 
ance of it from him» during his non* 
age, for a trifle. Immediately upon the 
ward's coming of age, the guardian^ 
keeping him still in darkness, found 
means to get the conveyance confirm* 
ed. Some years afterwards, the ward 

discovered the value of the inheritance 

he

he had be6n tbrowiog atvay. Private' 
representations proving, as it may he 
imagined, ioeffectnal, he applied to a 
court of eijuity. The suit was in some 
forwardness : the opioioo of the ablest 
counsel highly encouraging : but mo- 
ney there remained none. We all know 
but too well, that, in spite of the un- 
impeachable integrity of the bench, 
that branch of justice, which is parti- 
cularly dignified with the name of 
equity, is only for those who can af- 
fi«d to throw away one fortune for the 
chance of recovering another. Two 
persons, however, were found, who, 
between them, were content to defray 
tbe expense of the ticket for this lot- 
tery, on condition of receiving half the 
prize. The prospect now became en- 
couraging: when unfortunately one 
of the adventurers, in exploring the 
recesses of the bottomless pit, happen-

^ to dig up one of the old statutes 
against Champerty. This blew up the 
whole project: however the defend- 
ant, understanding that, some how or 
other, his antagonist had found sup- 
port, had thought fit in the mean time 
to propose terms, which the plaintiflf^ 
after his support had thus dropped from 
under him, was very glad to close with. 
He received, I think- it was» SOOOI.; 
and for that he gave up the estate, 
which was worth about as much year- 
ly, together with the arrears, which 
were worth about as much as the 
estate. 

Whether, in the barbarous age 
which gave birth to these .barbarous 
precautions, whether, even under the 
2enith of feudal anarchy, such fetter- 
ing regulations could have had reason 

> 

on their side, is a question of curiosity 
rather than use. My notion is, that 

G there

tbere never was a iimej tliat there oe- 
rer cbuld hare been, or can be a time, 
when the pushing of suitors away from 
court with one hand, while they are 
beckoned into it with another, would 
not be a policy equally faithless, in- 
consistent, and absurd. But, what 
every body must acknowledge, is, 
that, to the times which called forth 
these laws, and in which alone they 
could have started up, the present are 
as opposite as light to darkness. A 
mischief, in those times, it seems, but 
too common, though a mischief not to 
be cured by such laws, was, that a 
man would buy a weak claim, in 
hopes that power might convert it 
into a strong one, and that the sword 
of a baron, stalking into court with a 
rabble of retainers at his heels, might 
strike terror into the eyes of a judge 
upon the bench. At present, what 
carea 



y 



and Champerty. 1^ 

cares au English judge for the swords 
of an hundred barons? — ^Neither fear- 
i»g nor hoping^ hating nor loving, 
the judge of our days is ready with 
oqual phlegm to administer, upon aH 
occasions, that system, whatever it be, 
of justice, or injustice, which the law 
has put into his hands. A disposition 
so consonant to duty could not have 
then been hoped for : one more con- 
sonant is hardly to be wished. Wealth 
has indeed the monopoly of justice 
against poverty : and such monopoly 
it is the direct tendency an^ necessary 
effect of regulations like these to 
strengthen and confirm i But with 
this * monopoly no judge that lives 
now is at all chargeable. The law 
created this monopoly : the law, when 
ever it pleases, may dissolve it. 

I will not however so far wander 
from my subject as to inquire what 

6 S measure 



1*4 Lett.XII. Maintenance 

mjeasure might have, been necessary to 
afford a full relief to the case of that 
unfortunate gientleman^ any more than 
to the cases of so many other g6nt)e^ 
men who might be founds as unfortu- 
nate as he. I will not insist upon so 
atrange and so inconceivable an ar- 
rangement, as that of the judge's see- 
ing both parties face to face in the first 
instance, observing what the facts are 
in dispute, and declaring, that as the 
facts should turn out this way or that 
way, such or such would be his decree. 
At present, I confine myself to the 
removal of such part of the mischief, 
as may arise from the general conceit 
of keeping men out of difficulties, by 
cutting them off from such means of 
relief as each man's situation may af- 
ford. A spunge in this, as in so ma- 
ny other cases, is the only needful, and 
only availing remedy : one stroke of 

it 



I and Champerty. 125 

it for the musty laws against mainte- 
nance and champerty : another for the 
more recent ones against usury. Con- 
sider, for example, what would have 
respectively been the effect of two such 
strokes, in the case of the imfortunate 
gentlemen I have been speaking of. 
By the first, if what is called equity 
has any claim to confidence, he would 
have got, evem after paying off his 
champerty- usurers, 15001. a year ia 
land, and about as much in money : 
instead of getting, and that only by aa 
accident, 30001. once told. By the 
other, there is no saying to what a de^ 
gree he might have been benefited. 
May I be aUowed to stretch so far in 
favour of the law as to suppose, that 
80 small a sum as 5001. would have 
carried him through his suit, in the 
course of about three years ? I am sen- 
sible, that may be thought but a short 

sum. 



126 Lett. XII. Maintenance 

sunij and this but a short terrn^ for a 
suit in equity: but^ for the purpose 
of illustration, it may serve as well as 
a longer. Suppose he had sought this 
necessary sum in the way of borrow* 
ing ; and had been so fortunate, or, as 
the laws against the sin of usury would 
s^le it, so unfortunate, as to get it tf 
200 per cent. He would- then ha^^ 
purchased his 60001. a year at the price 
of half as much once paid, visi. SQOQt.; 
instead of selling it at that price. Whe* 
tber, if no such laws against usury bad 
been in being, he could have got the 
money,, even at that rate, I will not pre^ 
tend to say : perhaps he might not 
\we got it under ten tknes that rate, 
perhaps he might hate got it at the 
tenth part of that rate. Thus far, I 
thmk, we may say, that he might, and 
probably would, have been the better 
for the repeal of those laws : hut thus

tending to owe you nothing, I shall 
begin with acknowledging, that, as far 
as your track coincides with mine, I 
^ould come much nearer the truth, 
were I to say I owed you every thing. 
Should it be my fortune to gain any

weapons which you have taught me to

whether it be fit to restrain rashness^

and waste. 

Of prodigals I shall say no more at

sons for thinking, that it is. not among 
them that we are to look for the nar 
tural customers for money at high 
rates of interest. As far as those rea^ 
sons are conclusive, it will follow, that, 
of the two sorts of men you mention

the latter. As to these, what your de- 
finition is of projectors, and what de- 
scriptions of persons you meant to in- 
clude uoder the censure conveyed by 
that name, might be material for the 
purpose of judging of the propriety of 
that censure, but makes no differ-

were the severalclasses of persons mad©

be disposed to pick out this or that

order to exempt them from such cen-

rate> is at all times, and always will be, 
to be had upon the very best security, 
that the best and most prosperous old- 
established trade can afford. Traders 
in general, I believe, it is commonly 
understood, are well enough inclined to 
enlarge their capital, as far as all the 
money they can borrow at the highest 
legal rate, while that rate is so low as 5 
per cent, will enlarge it. How it is pou- 
eible therefore for a project, be it ever 
so promising, to afford, to a lender at 
any such rate of interest, terms equal- 
ly advantageous, upon the whole, with 
those he might be sure of obtaining 
from an old-established business, is 
more

more tham I can conceive. Loans of 
money may certainly chance, now and 
then, to find their way into the poc- 
kets of projectors i^ well as of other 
men : but when this hfappens, it must 
be tfaroilgh incautiousness, or friend- 
ship, or the expectation of some colla- 
teral benefit, and not through any 
idea of the adirantageousness of the 
trtmsaction/ in the light of a pecuniary 
bargain. 

I should not expect to see it alleg- 
ed, that there is any thing, that should 
i^ender the number of well-grounded 
projects, in comparison of the ill- 
grounded, less in time future, than it 
has been in time past. I am sure at 
least that I know of no reasons Why it 
should be so, though I know of some 
reasons, which I shall beg leaveto sub* 
mit to you by and by, which appear to 

me 



144 Lett.XUI. To Dr. Smith, 

me pretty good ones, why the advan- ' 
tage should be on the side of fatarity. 
But, unless thf stock of weD-grauDded- - 
projects is already spent, and the whole 
stock of ill-grounded projects th^' 
ever were possible, are to be looked 
for exclusively in the tijne to come, 
the jcensure you have passed on {H-ojec-' 
tors, ipeasuriag still the extent of it by 
that of the operation of the laws in the^ 
defence of which it is employed, looks 
as far backward as forward: it con- 
demns, as rash and ill-grounded, all- 
those projects, by which our species 
have been successively advanced from- 
tiiat state in which acorns were their. 
food, and raw hides - their cloathing, 
to the state in which it stands at pre- 
sent: for .think. Sir, letme beg of you,

ment^ project? whether whatever is 
now establishment^ was not, at one time^ 

innovation ? 

How it is that the tribe of welU 
grounded projects, and of prudent pro- 
jectors (if by this time I may have 
your leave for applying this epithet to 
some at least among the projectors of 
time past), have managed to struggle 
through the obstacles which the laws 
in question have been holding in their 
way, it is neither easy to know, nor 
necessary to inquire^ Manifest enough^ 
I think, it must be by this time, that 
difficulties, and those not inconsider^ 
able ones, those laws must have been 
holding up, in the way of projects of 
all sorts, of improvement (if I may say 
so) in every line, so long as they have 
had existence : reasonable therefore it 
must be to conclude, that, had it not 
been for these discouragements, pro- 

H jects 



146 Lett. XIII. To Dr. Smith, 

jects of all sorts^ well-grounded and 
saccessful ones, as well as others, would 
have been more numerous than they 
have been: and that accordingly, on 
the other hand, as soon, if ever, as these 
discouragements shall he removed^ 
projects of all sorts, and among the 
rest, well-grounded and successful 
ones, will be more numerous than 
they would otherwise have been: in 
^hort, that, as, without these discou- 
ragements, the progress of mankind 
in the career of prosperity, would have 
been greater than it has been under 
them in time past; so, were they to be 
removed, it would be ^at least proper* 
tionably greater in time future. 

That I had done you no injustice, 
in assigning to your idea of projectors 
so great a latitude, and that the unfa- 
vourable opinion you have professed 
to entertain of them is not confined to 

the

find outy if he can, among all these 
periods, any one at which the condi- 
tion of the country was not more pros-

preceding it : spite of so many wars, 
and fires, and plagues, and all other 
public calamities, with which it has 
been at different times aiBicted, whe- 
ther by the hand of God, or by the 
misconduct of the sovereign. No very

manifest for the most jaundiced eye to 
escape seeing it : — But what and whom 
are we to thank for it, but projects,

not imagine your penetration would 
suffer yon to rest satisfied with it^ still 
less can I suppose that, if you^ were 
not, your candour would allow you. 
to make use of it as if you were. 

To prevent your resting satisfied 
with it, the following considerations 
would, I think, be sufficient. 

In the first place, of the seven pe- 
riods which you have pitched upon, 
as so many stages for the eye to rest 

H 3 at. 



154 Lett. XIII. To 2>r. Smith, 

at in viewing the progress of prospe- 
rity^ it is only during the three last, 
that the country has had the benefit, 
if SQCh we are to call it, of these laws : 
for it is to the reign of Henry VIII. 
that we owe the first of them. 

Here a multitude of questions might 
be started: Whether the curbing of 
projectors formed any part of the de- 
sign of that first statute, or whether 
the views of it were not whoHy con- 
fined to the reducing the gains of that 
obnoxious and envied class of men, 
the money-lenders ? Whether projec- 
tors have been most abundant before 
that statute,or since that statute? And 
whether the nation has suflnsred, as you 
might say — benefited, as I should say, 
most by them, upon the whole, dur- 
ing the former period or the latter? 
All these discussions, and many more 
that might be started, I decline engag- 
ing 



on Prig€ct$ in Aftf^ Xc I4fj 

ing io^ as mQre likely to retard^ than 
to {otwaxA^ our coming to any agree- 
ment conoerning the main question. 

In the next place, I must heve take 
the liberty of referring yon to the 
proof, which J think I have already 
given, of the proposition, that the re* 
straints in question could never have 
had the effect, in any degree, of lessen- 
ing the proportion of bad projects to 
good ones, but only of diminishing, 
•8 far as their influence may have ex- 
tended, the total number of projects, 
good and bad together. Whatever 
therefore was the general tendency of 
the projecting spirit previously to the 
first of these laws, such it must have 
remained ever since, for any effect 
which they could have had in purify- 
ing and correcting it. 

But what may appear more sa1is£BK;- 
tory perhaps than both the above con- 
siderations^ 



156 Lett. XIII. To Dr. Smm, 

siderations, and may ^ord us the 
best help towards extricating ourselves 
from the perplexity, which the plea I 
have beea combating' (and which I 
thought it necessary to bring to view,' 
fts the best that could be urged) seems 
much better calculated to plunge us 
into, than bring us out of, is, the con- 
sideration of the small effect which the 
greatest waste that can be conceived to 
have been made within any compass of 
time, by injudicious projects, can have 
had on the sum of prosperity, even in 
the estimation of those whose opinion 
is most unfarourable to projectors, in 
comparison of the effect which within 
the same compass of time must have 
been produced by prodigality, 
-, Of the two causes, and only two 
causes, which yon mention, as contri- 
buting to retard the accumulation of 
national wealth, as far as the conduct 
of

ing, as I observed before^ is the one» 
and prodigality is the other : but the 
detriment^ which society can peceive 
even from the concurrent efficacy of 
both these causes^ you represent on se-

and, if I do not naisapprehend you^ 
too inconsiderable^ either to need^ or 
to warrant, the interposition of govern-^ 
ment to oppose it. Bcf this as it may 
with regard to projecting and pro- 
digality taken together, with regard 
to prodigality at least, I am certain 1 
do not misapprehend you. On this 
subject you ride triumphant, and 
chastise the ^' impertinence and pre 
'^ sumption of kings and ministers,'^

That the employing the expedients

without exceptioD, improper^ and in 
floany cases even ridiculous. I agree 
with you : nor will I here step aside 
from my subject to defend from that

a former part of these papers. But 
bowever presumptuous and imperti« 
nent it may be for the sovereign to at- 
tempt in any way to check by legal 
restraints the prodigality of individaals, 
to attempt to check their bad manage^ 
ment by such restraints^ seems abun* 
dantly more so. To err in the way oS 
prodigality is the lot» thcmgh, as you 
well observe, not of mam/ men, in 
comparison of the whole mass of man-

fit to make a prodigal of is to be found 
in every alehouse, and under every

kedge. But e?en to err in the way of 
projectiDg is the lot only of the privi- 
leged few. Prodigality^ though not 
8o common as to make any very ma- 
terial drain from the general mass of 
wealthy is however too common to be 
regarded as a mark of distinction or 
as a singularity. But the stepping 
aside from any of the beaten paths of 
trf^c, is regarded as a singularity^ as 
serving to distinguish a man from other 
men. Even where it requires no ge- 
nius^ no peculiarity of talent, as where 
it consists in nothing more than the 
finding out a new market to buy or 
sell in, it requires however at least a 
degree of courage^ which is not to be 
found in the common herd of men. 
What shall we say of it, where, in 
addition to the vulgar quality of cou- 
rage, it requires the rare endowment 
of genius, as in the instance of all those 

successive

successive enterprises by which arts 
and manufactures have been brought 
from their original nothing to their 
present splendour ? Think how smatt 
a part of the community these must 
make, in comparison of the race of 
prodigals ; of that very race, whicb> 
were it only on account of the smaU« 
ness of its number, would appear too 
inconsiderable to you to deserve at-» 
tention. Yet prodigality is essentially 
and necessarily hurtful, as far as it goes, 
to the opulence of the state : project- 
ing, only by accident. Every prodi-^ 
gal, without exception, impairs, by the 
very supposition impairs, if he does 
not annihilate, his fortune. But it 
certainly is not every projector that 
impairs his : it is not every projector 
that would have done so, had there 
been none of those wise laws to hih-. 
der him :. for the fabrib of national 

opulence^ 



* 



16« Lett. XIII. To Dr. Smithy 

opulence^ that fabric of whtcfa you 
proclaim, with so generous an exulta^ 
tion, the continual increase, that fa* 
brie, in every apartment of which, 
innumerable as they are, it required 
the reprobated hand of a projector to 
lay the first stone, has required some 
hands at least to be employed^ and 
successfully employed. When in com- 
parison of the number of prodigals, 
which is too inconsiderable to deserve 
notice, the number of projectors of 
all kinds is so much more inconsi-^ 
derable — and when from this incon- 
siderable number, must be deducted, 
the not inconsiderable proportion of 
successful projectors — and from this 
remainder again, all those who can 
carry on their projects without need d 
borrowing — ^think whether it be possi- 
ble, that this last remainder could af-

ground, and beg you once more to 
consider, whether, of all that host of 
manufactures, which we both exult in 
as the causes and ingredients of na^

that could have existed at first but in 
the shape of a project. But, if a re-

gulation^ the tendency and effect of 
which is merely to check projects^ 
in as far as they are projects^ without 
any sort of tendency^ as I have shewn, 
to weed out the bad ones^ is defensible 
in its present state of imperfect effica* 
cy^ it should not only have been de- 
fensible, but much more worthy of 
our approbation, could the efficacy of 
it have been so far strengthened and 
compleated as to have opposed, from 
the beginning, an unsurmountable bar 
to all sorts of projects whatsoever: 
that is to say, if, stretching forth its 
hand over the first rudiments of soci" 
ety, it had confined us, from the be^ 
ginning, to mud for our habitations, 
to skins for our cloathing, and to 
acorns for our food.

rity, is tlie natural state not only of 
the road to opulence, but of every 
other track of human life. In the war 
which industry and ingenuity main^^ 
tain with fortune, past ages of igno- 
rance and barbarism form the forlorn 
hope, which has been detached in ad- 
vance, and made a sacrifice of for the 
sake of future. The goldeti age, it is 
but too true, is not the lotJ^of the ge- 
neration in which we live: but, if it 
is to be found in any part of the track 
marked out for human existence, it 
will be found, I trust, not in any part 
which is past, but in some part which 
is to come. 

But to return to the laws against 

I 2 usury. 



172 LEtT.XIII. To Dr. Smith, 

usury i and their restraining influence 
on projectors. I haye made it^ I hope, 
pretty apparent; that these restraints 
have no power or tendency to pick 
but bad projects from the good. > Is it 
worth while to add, which I think I 
may do with some truth, that the ten- 
dency of them is rather to pick the 
good out from the bad } Thus much 
at least may be said» and it comes 
to the same thing, that there is one 
case in which, be the project what it 
may, they may haye the effect of 
checking it, and another in which they 
can have qp such effect; and that the 
first has for its accompaniment, and 
that a necessary one, a circumsitance 
which has a strong tendency to sepa- 
rate and discard every project of the. 
injudicious stamp, but which is want- 
ing in the other case. I mean, in a 
word, the benefit of discussion. 

It 



on Prefects in Arts, Xc. 178 

It is evident enough, that upon all 
such, projects^ whatever be- their na* 
tare, as find funds sufficient to carry 
theoi on, in the hands of him whose 
invention gave them .birth, these laws 
are pjerf^ctly, and if by this time you 
.will allow me to say so, very .happily, 
without power. But for these there 
has not necessarily been any other 
judge, prior to experience, than the , 
inventor's p wn partial affection . It is 
not only not necessary that they should 
have had, but it is natural enough 
thai they should not have had, any 
sDcb judge: since in most cases > the 
advantage to be expected from , tbe 
project depends upon the exclusive 
property in it, and consequently 
upon the concealment of the princi- 
ple. Think, on the other hand, how 
different is the lot. of that enterprise 
which depends upon the good opinion 

of

of a suppliant at Jeast : happy H, in 
the imagination of hii judge, he adds 
not to Ihat degrading character, ihat 
of a visionary entbusiastor an impodtori 
At any rate, there are, in this case, two 
wits, set to sift into the merits of the 
project for one, which was employed 
upon that same task in the other case: 
and 'of tbeK two there i^ one, whose 
prejudices are certainly not most like- 
ly to be on the favonrable side. True 
it is, that in the jumble of occurrences, 
an over-sanguine projector may stum- 
ble upon a patron as over-Sangnine a* 
himself; and the wi^es may bribe the 
judgment of the one, as they did ' of 
the other. The opposite case, how- 
ever, you will allow, 1 think, to be by

ral welfare, which, on so many occa- 
sions, are made by third persons against 
men's wills, shall the parties them- 
selves be restrained from making, when 
they do it of their own choice ? To tie 
men neck and . heels, and throw them

of, is altogether out of the question :

a fit of old-womanish tenderness, to pull 
him away ? Laying even public interest 
ont of the^ question,^ and: considering 
nothitig but the feelings of the indivi- 
. duals immediately concerned, a legis- ^ 
lator would scarcely do so, who knew 
the value of hope, << the most preqious 
" gift of heaven." 

Consider, Sir, that it is not with the . 
inv^tion-lottery (that great branch: of 
the project lottery, for the sake of 
which I am defending the whole, and 
must continue so to do until you- or 
somebody else can shew me how ^ to 
defend it on. better temis), it is not I 
say with. the. invention-lottery, as with 
the mine-lottery, the privateerings 
lottery, and so many other lotteries, 
which you speak of, and in no instance, 
I think, very much to their advantage.

you of the best means of relieving the 
projector from the load of discoun^ei^

far as the pressure of them falls parti* 
cularly upon him. In my own. view

is more common with manjkind, than 
\o g^ve opposite receptions, tocou^

from the sagie principle, let us ac* 
commodate our views to that con- 
tingency.

45 far as confined to ihe present case; 
should be, to provide, in favour of 
projectors only, a dispensation from 
the dgour of the antirusurious laws: 
soich, ibr instance, as is enjoyed by 
persons engaged in the carrying trade^ 
m virtue of the indulgence . given to 
loans made on the footing of respond 
dentia QT bottomry. As to abuse, I 
see not why the danger of it should be 
greater in this case than in those. Whe- 
ther a sum of money be embarked, or 
not embarked, in such or such a new 
manufacture on land, should not, in its 
owu nature, be a fact much more dif- 
ficult to ascertain^ than whether it be 
embarked, or not embarked, in such 
or such a trading adventure by sea: 
and, in the one case as in the other, 
the payment of the interest, as well as 
the repayment, of the: principal,, might 
be made to depend upon the success 

of

tax upon justice, the effect may be, 
Uiat after he has paid the tax, he may, 
withitMit gettiug justice by the pay<* 
QEient, lose bread by it : bread, the 
Tpfaole quantity on which be depended 
for the subsistence of faiaisdf and his

Half justice, where it is to be bad, is 
better than no justice : but without

there is no getting a grain of justice. 

A tax on necessaries is a tax on this 
or that article, of the commodities 
which happen to be numbered among 
necessaries : a tax on justice is a tax 
on all necessaries put together. A 
tax on a necessary of life can only 
lessen a man's share of that particular 
sort of article : a tax on justice may 
deprive a man, and that in any pro* 
portion, of all sorts of necessaries. 

This is not yet the worst. It is not 
only a burthen that comes in the train 
of distress, but a burthen against which 
no provisioh can be made. 

All other taxes may be either fore- 
seen as to the time, or at any rate pro- 
vided for, where general ability is not 
wanting : in the instance of this tax, 
it is impossible to foresee the moment 
of exaction, it is equally impossible to

LAW-TAXES. 



Taxes on law-proceedings consti- 
tute in rtiany, and perhaps in all na- 
tions, a part of the resources of the 
state. They do so in Great Britain : 
they do so in Ireland. In Great Bri- 
tain, an extension of them is to be 
found among the latest productions 
of the budget : in Ireland, a further 
extension of them is among the inea> 
sures of the day. It is this impending 
extension that calls forth the publica- 
tion of the present sheets, the substance 
of

doom upon tfaousands, not to say mil-^ 
lioDs^ of innocent and injured subjects, 
without consideration or remorse. 

Mark well, that of all sorts of men, 
it is the poor, and they the more cer- 
tainly in proportion to their poverty, 
that are despoiled in this way of the 
protection of the law : the protection 
of the law« that inestimable jewel, 
which in the language of that very 
law is defined the citizen's universal 
and best birth-right: the poor and 
him that has none to help him, these 
are they to whom the help of the law 
is thus unfeelingly refused. The rich, 
were it from them that this great safe- 
guard were withholden, have shields 
of their Qwn to ward oflF the attacks of 
injury : the natural influence of wealth, 
the influence of situation, the power 
of connexion, the advantages of edu- 
cation, and intelligence;^ which go

hand in hand with wealth. The poor 
has but one strong hold, the protec- . 

tion of the law : and out of this the 
fina^ncier drive's him without vouch- 
safing him a thought, in company 
with the herd of malefactors. 

The poor^ on account of the igno- 
rance and intellectual incapacity inse- 
parably attached to poverty^ are de- 
barred generally^ as perhaps it is ne- 
cessary, were it only for their own 
sake, they should be universidly, from 
the sweets of political power : but are 
not so many unavoidable inequalities 
enough, without being added to by 
unnecessary injustice ? 

Such is the description of those 
from whom this sum total of all rights 
is torn away with one hand, while ten- 
dered with the other : what are their 
numbers in proportion to the sum to- 
tal of subjects I I fear to sfty — ^perhaps

at the lowest rate, on the plaintiff's side alone. 
[See Sdiieffer on Costs, 1793.] The arerage 
expense of civil .suits of all sorts, taking equity 
causes into the account, can surely not be rated 
at less than double that amount, on that one 
side. The average expenditure of an English 
suliriect, infants and adults, rich as well as poor, 
Udsen together, has been computed by Davenant 
(as quoted on this occasion somewhere by Adam 
Smith) at 8L a year. Six years income then u 
what a man must have in advance, before he can 
be admitted to take his chance for justice. Of 
many estimates which Dr. Anderson had met 
with, SOI. was the highest, and he takes but teiv 
pounds. [Interest of Great Britain with regard 
to her colonies^ London, 1793.] No man then 
we may say at any rate, can have the benefit of 
justice, in the ordinary way, either in making 
good a just claim, or saving himself from an un-

more deplorable than that of either of 
the other two. I mean those^ who

progress^ see their substance swallowed

the bread they asked for, first rob 
theni of their money, and then turn 
them out of doors. To an unpreju-

this occasion a picture almost too near 
the truth to be termed an apologue.

If in all cases the practice is wicked, 
]Q some it is more particularly prepos* 
terous. In civil causes, and other 
causes where the injury to individuals 
affords a natural interest to prosecute, 
artificial expenses are cruelty and 
breach of faith : in a large class of pe- 
na,l causes, in which for want of such 
natural interest, prosecutors must be 
engaged by factitious inducements, or 
the law be a dead letter, the cruelty 
and treachery are crowned by blunder 
and inconsistency. ' Beckoned into 
court with one hand, men are driven 
away with the other. But, costly as the 
attractive power frequently is, the re- 
pulsive force is apt to be much stronger. 
Rewai^d is subsequent, distant, uncer-

Trouble, expense, and odium, are cer-

In favour of this species of imposi- 

* His speeies of tax would stand absolutely 
done in point of depravity, were it not for the 
tax on drugs, as far at it extends, to those used ia 
medicine. This, as being also a tax upon dis- 
tress, is so far in specie the same> but is nothing 
to it in degree. To recover a shilling in the 
way of justice, it will cost you at least 241. of 
which a good part in taxes: but to be admitted: 
to buy a shiHing^s worth of medicine for a shil- 
hng, it does not cost yon threepence. Hospi-^ 
tals for the sick are not uncommon r there are 
none for harassed and impoverished suitors* / 
There are Lady Bauntifuls that relieve the sick 
firom the tax on medicines, and the price of them 
into the bargain : but a Lady Bountiful must be 
bountiful indeed, to take the place of attorney 
and counsel, as well as of physician and apothe-^ 
cary, and supply a poor man with as many 
^, pounds worth of latUatM and pleas, as he must 
have to recover a shilling. A man cannot, as 
we have seen, insure himself against law suits : 
Imt a man may insure himself, and many tiSou- 
sands actually do insure themselves, against sick* 
ness. But these reliefs are neither certain nor 

general ;: 



aa They throw the Burthen^ 

tioD^ I have seen two arguments pro- 
duced. 

One is, that in this case as in others, 
the burthen of an establishment ought 
to lie on those by whom the benefit is 
reaped. The principle is incontrover- 
tible : the matter of fact supposed by 
the application of it is not true. 

The argument, were it just, would 
not extend beyond so much of the 
produce of the tax as is requisite for 
defraying the charge of this part of the 
national establishment. Whether it be 
confined or no within these bounds, 
was perhaps never thought worth en- 
general : and after all, a lax on him who baa 
had a leg or an arm broken, a tax on bim who 
has had a fit of the ague, gout, rheumatism, or 
stone, will be the worst possible species of tax, 
next to a tax on justice. 

. N. B. The tax on quack medicines, that is, 
on unknown and unapproved medicines, leav- 
ing aU known and approved ones untouched, 
611s hi a less degree, if at all, under this censure.

and it seems to be resorted to from 
time to time, : with as little scruple, as 
an extension of the: customs or excise. 
But let this pass. 

As to the notion of a connexity in 
this case betwixt the benefit and the 
burthen, it has.been countenanced by 
an authority too respectable, not to 
deserve the most serious notice i* but 
come it from whom it will, it is a 
mere illusion.. The persons on whom 
the whole of the burthen is cast^ are 
precisely those, who have the least en- 
joyment of the benefit : the security 
which other people enjoy for nothing, 
without interruption, and every mo- 
ment of' their lives, they who are so

tion to what pecuniary expense may

which is of most value ? which most 
worth paying for ? — a possession thus 
cruelly disturbed, or the same posses- 
sion free from all disturbance ? — So 
&r then from being made thus wan* 
tonly to pay an extra price, a man 
who stands in this unfortunate pre- 
dicament, ought rather to receive an 
indemni6cation at the public expense,, 
fpr his time and trouble : and the dan- 
ger of insidious or collusive contests, 
in the view of obtaining such an in- 
demnity, is the only objection I can 
see, though perhaps a conclusive one, 
against the, granting it. 

Litigation may in this point of 
view be compared to war in sober sad- 
ness, as war has been to litigation in

the way of pleasaatrjr. The suitor is 
th« forlorn hopo in this forensic warf* 
fare. To throw upon the suitor the 
expeose of admiaisteriug justice, in 
addition to the trouble and the risk 
of suing for it, is as if> in case of an 
invasion, you were to take the inhabi-* 
tants of the frontier, and force thmn^ 
not only to serve for nothing, but ta 
defray of thenaselves the whole expen- 
diture of the war. 

What in our times is become inve«* 
terate practice, is stigmatized as a 
' species of iniquity without a prece* 
dent, by Saint Pauh " Who is there,** 
demands the Apostle, ^' who is there 
tlmt ever goes to war at his own 
charge ?" — *^ Alas, r cries the pooi^ 
suitor, ^^ I do.'* 

The other argument in favour of a 
set of taxes of this kind,* is, that they 
are a check to litigation. 

Litigation is a term not altogether 

free 



-'1. 



^i^m^jMfeMi^^aA . 



96 No Check to Idtigiousnes^, 

free from ambiguity. It is used some** 
times in a neutral sense^ to denote 
the prosecnting or defending a suit, 
though perhaps more frequently in a 
bad one. In its neutral sense, it ex- 
presses the irreproachable exercise of 
an essential right r in a bad sense a 
species of misconduct practised under 
the notion of exercising such a right. 

In the first sense, taxes can never 
have been recommended by any man 
as a check to litigation : in this sense, 
an avowed desire of checking litiga- 
tion, would be neither more nor less 
than an avowed desire of denying jus- 
tice. 

In a bad sense again, the word 
ia used on two different occasions r 
where the suit, whatever be the import- 
ance of the matter in dispute, is on 
the part of the person spoken of as 
maintaining it, e^ groundless one : and 

.where 



but an Encouragement. 47 

Where the suit, however well grounded 
on his part in point of titles is on ac> 
count of the supposed unimportance 
of the matter in dispute, deemed a /n- 
volous, a- tricing, a trivial one : and in 
. either case, it is t^ course applicaUe 
to the situation of either plaintiff or 
defendant ; though it is apt to fix in 
the first instance and most readily up- 
on the situation of the plaintifi", as be- 
ing the party, who by taking the first 
step on the commencement ot the suit, 
exhibits himself as the author of it. 

On either side, litigation, when 
groundless, may be accompanied or 
not, with what the lawyers call in 
genere malitia, meaning consciousness of 
misdoing, and in this particular case 
■ntalafidesy consciousness of the ground-

where it is well grounded^ and in the

contending parties cannot in point of 
law be actually in the rights though 
either or both may think themsdves 
no, the impediment cannot operate to 
the denial of justice, but it must ope* 
rate to the prevention of groundless li« 
tigation at the same time. Prevent 
him who is in the right from institute 
ing a suit, you prevent him who is in 
the wrong from defending one. But 
neither is litigaticm prevented, any 
further than as justice is denied. So 
far then as this case extends, it is stilt 
but the other side of the same effect^ 
the denial qf justice.

these laws are thus far the sole canse^ 
setting out of the question the imper^ 
fectioQS of the judicial system, and 
the hope of seeing evidence peridi, 
or the guilty view of fabricating it, a 
fnan ^ill find no motive for instit«« 
ting a suit for an ordinary pecuniary 
demand, without believing himself to 
be in the right : for if he is in the 
wrong, disappointment, waste of time, 
fruitless trouble, and so. much ex-*

9te by the supposition what he knows

although he knows himself to be in

to stand a suit from a thousand other

the party most oppressed by it. The 
party* most oppressed is the complain*

hands of juj^ce. But, so as there does

Another iojastice.^-r-The poorer a

to expose himself to such a consump*

St Why resorted to, 

- A tax so impolitic and so grievous, 
a tax thus demonstrated to be the 
worst of taxes^ how comes it ever 
to have been made choice of, and 
when made choice of, acquiesced in ? 
— These are not questions of mere 
curiosity: for acquiescence under a 
tax, :and that so general, forms at first 
glance no inconsiderable presumptioQ 
in its favour. A presumption it doea 
form: but when demonstration faaa 
sh^wn itself, presumptions are at an 
end. 

How comes the tax to have been 
made choice of? — One cause we have* 
seen already in another shape; the 
unscrutinized notion of its supposed 
tendency to check litigation: litiga*

chief, . is the very misthief which the

It is the wealthy alone, that either, by 
fortune, situation, education, inteUi-. 
gence, or influence, are quali&ed to 
take the lead in legislation : and the 
characteristic property of this tax, is 
to be favourable to the wealthy, and 
that in proportion to their wealth.; 
Other taxes affond a man no indenini-- 
fication for the wealth they take froto.

you could not teil exactly to how ma*

tice^ you might be sure you dpened 
them to some. Though yoa would 
still leave the burthen but too heavy, 
you would at any rate make it propor- 
tionably more supportable. 

If by taking off these taxes, you re^ 
duced the expense of a common action 
from 9SI. to sol., you might open 
the door, suppose, to one in five of 

those 



0S Whf resorted to, 

those against whom it is shut at pre* 
tent. Eren this would be something : at 
any rate whatever were the remaining 
quantum of abuse, which you still suf- 
fered to subsist^ you would have the 
consolation at least of not being active- 
ly instrumental in producing 4t. To 
jfeform in toto a system of procedure is 
a work of time and difficulty, and 
firould require a rare union of legal 
knowledge with genius :— repealing a 
tax may require discernment, candour, 
philanthropy, and fortitude ; but is a 
work of no difficulty, requires no extra- 
ordinary measure of science, nor even 

« 

90 much time as the imposing of one. 

But by whatever plea the continu- 
ance of the subsisting taxes of this 
kind may be apologized for, nothing 
can be said in favour of any new addi- 
tion to the burthen. The subsisting 
ones, it may be said, have been acqui- 
esced in, and men are used to them : 

in 



and acquiesced under. 63 

in this respect at least they have the ad<* 
vantage of any new ones which could 
be substituted in the room of them. 
But even this iaimoral plea, which puts 
bad and good upon a level, effacing all 
distinction but that between established 
and not established, even this faint plea 
is mute against any augmentation of 
this worst of evils^ 

To conclude — Either I am much 
mistaken, or it has been proved— 
that a law tax is the worst of all taxes^ 
actaal or possible : — ^that for the most 
part it is a denial of justice, that at 
the best, it is a tax upon distress :-— 
that it lays the burthen, not where 
there is most, but where there is least, 
benefit: — ^that it co-operates with 
every injury, and with every crime :-— 
that the persons on whom it bears 
hardest, are those on whom a bur- 
then of any kind lies heaviest, and^ 
that they compose the great majority 

of 



64 Recapitulation. 

of the people : — that so far from being 
a check, it is an encouragement to li- 
tigation : and that it operates in direct 
breach of Magna Charta^ that venera- 
ble monument, commonly regarded as 
the foundation of English liberty. 
The statesman who cares not wbat 

• 

mischief he does, so he does it without 
disturbance, may lay on law taxes with- 
out end : he who makes a conscience 
to abstain from mischief will abstain 
from adding to them : he whose ambi- 
tion it is to extirpate mischief, will re- 
peal them. 

General error makes late, says a 
maxim in use among lawyers. It 
pnakes at any rate an apology for law : 
but when the error is pointed out, tb^ 
apology is gone.

NOTES 

TO THE 

SECOND EDITION. 



Mem. — ^Anno, 1796. At a dinner at Mr. M. 
P/s, in " ■■ Street, Mr. R. in the presence 

of Mr. William Pitt, (then Minister) took me 
aside, and told me that they had read my Pam- 
phlet on Law Taxes ; that the reasons against them 
were unanswerable, and it was determined there 
should be no more of them. 

Anno, 1804, July 10, 19, U, IS.—This being 
in the number of Mr. Addington's Taxes, Mr. 
Pitt, upon returning to office, took up all those 
Taxes in the lump. On the above days, this Tax 
was opposed in the House of Commons : and Mr. 
Wyndham, according to the report in the Times, 
on one of those days, spoke of this Pamphlet as 
containing complete information on the subject ; 
observing at the' same time, that it was out of 
print On behalf of administration^ nothing like 
an answer to any pf the objections was attempted : 
only the Attorney-General (Percival) said, that 

the 



66 



tbe addition fHoposed to those Tax€$, was no- 
more than equal to the depreciation of money. 

Mr. Addington, b^ore this* had recourse to the 
Tax on Medicine hece q>oken of, (p. 32.) So 
that, in the course of his short administration, if 
the representation here gtsn be covrect, he had 
had the misfortune to find out and impose the two 
worst species of taxation possible. Compare this 
with Denmark, and its courts oi Natural Proceditre^ 
called ReccmdHatiim Count. 

26th Febniary,1816. — Unallsriatcd by any ade- 
quate hope of use, too painful would be the task, of 
bun ting out, and holding up to ylew, Uie sidisequent 
additions, which this worst of oppressions has, in 
this interval of twenty years, been receiving. 

Money, it is said, must be bad, and no other 
taxes can be found. The justification being con- 
clusive, the tax receives its increase : next year» 
from the same hand, flow others in abundance. 

Grievous enough is the Jbtcomc Tax, called,, 
lest it should be thought to be what it is, the 
Prcperiy Tax, — Grievous that tax is, whatever be 
its name ; yet, sum for sum, compared with this, 
tax, it is a blessing. Instead of 10 per cent sup- 
pose it 80 per cent. Less bad would it be to add 
yet another 10 per cent, than a tax to an equal 
amount upon justice. 

Grievoua 



67 



Grievoui have been the additions, so lately and 
repeatedly made, to the taxes on Conveyancei and 
Agreements. Extensive the prohibitory part of 
the effect, though the pressure, — confined as 
usual to the poor, i. e. the great majority of -the 
community, who have none to speak for them,— 
is scarcely complained of by the rich. Yet, were 
all law-taxes taken o£F^ and the amount thrown 
upon Conve^iances and Agreements, this-^yen this 
—•would in reality be an indulgence. 

Whether the oppression be more or less griev- 
ous, is never worth a thought Will it be sub- 
mitted to? — ^This is the only question. Charity 
is kicked out of doors. Hope is fled. Faith and 
Piety remain, and atone for every things 

For a list of about twenty-eight other sources 
of factitious delay, vexation, and expense, and 
ihence of denial of justice, produced by the judges 
of former times, for the augmentation of lawyers' 
profit, their 0W9 included, — together with a list 
and summary account of the devices by which 
these burthens have been imposed, and by which 
Teclmical stands distinguished from Natural PrO" 
eedure, — see by the same author, Scotch Reform^

fade of the expenie that woald thus be occasion- 
ed j— or whether if, without any such objection, the 
Defendant had actually set out these accounts^ 
the Pbintiff could have been relieved from pur* 
suing the regular mode of procuring a copy of 
them, and thus incurring the above expense ;— or 
whether, if the expense had been instead of 
39,0001. only 28 or 27 thousand pounds, such 
an objection would have been listened to;— it is 
extremely difficult to say. 

The other case alluded to, is one in which 
from peculiar circumstances, it is not thought 
proper to mention the names of the parties. 
It is optional with a man to be a Plaintiff in 
a cause, it is not altogether so optional with 
him to be a Defendant The preceding case 
shews that it is not always safe for a man to 
become a Haintiff, without 28>000/. at least in 
his pocket, to begin with, over and above what 
is necessary for his maintenance. — ^The following 
case shews that a man may not be always able to 
resist a demand, however unjust it may be, with- 
out being able to support an outlay of at least 
800/. In the case in question, the writer of this 
has been assured, — and from authority, which he 
has peculiar reason for relying upon,— ^at the ex- 
pense of merely putting in an answer by one of the 
Defendants to a bill in Equity, amounted to the
