no genuine edition during theauthor^s lifetime, which lasted 
until 1679. But three years later his old publishery William 
Crooke, issued a volume entitled, TnuU of Mr. Th.ff.0/ 
Malmsbury^ containing in the first place the treatise en- 
titled Behemoth^ which is followed by three other pieces, and 
introduced by the following remarks : ** My duty, as well to

by the several spurious editions of the ' History of the Civil

committed above a thousand faults, and in above a hundred

vMi PREFACE. 

Hobbesy written to him shortly before the philosopher's death, 
and rehting to the same afTaify which in pm explains, in part 

modifies, his foregoing statements. This letter he prefixed 
to his new edition of Hobbes's apology for his own life and 
character, in x68o {Cansidemtions ufan the re^oHan^ kyaUy^ 
manners^ and religum of Thomas BiMes of Malmsbury 
written by himself by way if letter to a learned person)^ in- 
serting it in the following ** advertisement to the readers " : 
'*I do here present you with a piece of Mr. Hobbes's 
writing, which is not published from an imperfect MS., as 
his ' Dialogue of the Civil Wars of England ' was (by some 
that had got accidentally a copy of it) absolutely against his 
consent, as you may see by some passages out of some of 
his letters to me which I have here inserted. In his letter of 
June, 1679, ^^ saith: I would fain have published my 
* Dialogue of the Civil Wars of England ' long ago, and to 
that end I presented it to his Majesty ; and some days after, 
when I thought he had read it, I humbly besought him to 
let me print it; but his Majesty (though he heard me 
graciously, yet he) flatly refused to have it published. 
Therefore I brought away the book, and gave you leave to 
take a copy of it; which, when you had done, I gave the 
original to an honourable and learned friend, who about a 
year after died. The king knows better, and is more con- 
cerned in publishing of books than I am : therefore I dare 
not venture to appear in the business, lest it should ofiend 
him. Therefore I pray you not to meddle in the business. 
Rather than to be thought any way to further or counten- 
ance the printing, I would be content to lose twenty times 
the value of what you can expect to gain by it," &c. To 
this now may be added the following unprinted passage 
from a letter^ which was addressed at a still later date 
(August 19, 1679) ^7 ^c ^%^ philosopher to his friend 
John Aubrey (the end of it being inserted in Aubrey's 
Sketch of Hobbes's Life, published in " Letters from the 
Bodleian," voL il, ubi vid. p. 614), running thus : "I have 
been told that my book of the civil war is come abroad,

value of the cotiection s and additioos made in this edition 
will in part be seen fiom the notes at the foot of the page^ 
in which the more Important of them are indicated^ 

As to the book itself, it will give not a litde pleasure to 
any thinking reader, beings in the words of Warburton« 
^'fiill of shrewd remarks;" and it may be recommended 
as of high interest to the historical student as well as 
to the philosopher and politician. For, **in spite of his 
estrangement from the world around him, Hobbes continues 
to possess an increasing historical importance. Men and 
things change, but ideas expressed in words and in writing 
can soar above this change, and exercise an influence over 
the most distant epochs '* (Leopold von Ranke, History of 
England^ Engl, trans., voL iii. p. 576). And in confirmation 
of this view it may not be amiss also to quote the words by 
which a former editor (Mr. Maseres) justifies the republican 
tion of *« Behemoth." 

*'As Mr. Hobbes," he says (vol. ii. p. 65 7X "was a man 
of great ability and learning, and well acquainted with the 
history and forms of government of many different nations, 
both ancient and modem; and was also, as I believe, a very 
honest man and a great lover of truth; and as he lived 
through the two reigns of King James the First and King 
Charles the First, and through the Interregnum after King 
Charles's death to the Restoration of King Charles the 
Second, and through the next following eighteen years; 
and as he was, for the most part, resident in England 
during the ten years immediately preceding the civil war, 
and had conversed with t^everal of the most eminent persons 
who afterwards were engaged in it, both on the king's side 

' The words and passages which were never printed before, and 
aihongst them the EpisUe dedicatory, have been marked by asteriscs at 
the beginning and the end of them ; and the sentences which were 
erased in the MS., by farenthesez *[. . . .]* also. In the foot-notes 
I would chiefly draw attention to a number of corrections which are 
inserted in the MS. by the author's own hand.

and that of the Parliament — I thought he was a writer 
singularly fit to be oonstilted and citad at a witnesi of the 
several events and transactions in those preceding years of 
King Charles's reign, which might justly be considered as 
the causes of the unhappy contestt** &c 

It will be needful, perhaps, to give an explanation of the 
aged philosopher's complaint, quoted above (p. viii), as to 
the ' foolish title ' prefixed to previous editions of the pre- 
sent work. The fact is that the words, **or the Long Par- 
liament," now inserted according to the MS., had been left 
out in those editions, and consequently the meaning of the 
principal title {inz. Behemoth) failed to be suggested to the 
reader's mind ; which meaning, as will now be sufficiently 
evident, implies a relation of contrast to the better known 
Leviathan^ as representing the idea of a bwful government.

B* How could he then miscarry, having in every county • 
so many trained soldiers, as would, put together, have made 
an army of 60,000 men, and divers magazines of ammuni 
tion in places fortified ? 

A. If those soldiers had been, as they and all other of 
his subjects ought to have been, at his Majesty's command, 
the peace and happiness of the three kingdoms had con- 
tinued as it was left by King James. But the people were 
corrupted generally, and disobedient persons esteemed the 
best patriots. 

B. But sure there were men enough, besides those that * 
were ill-alTected, to have made an army sufficient to have 
kept the people from uniting into a body able to oppose 
him. 

A. Truly, I think, if the King had had money, he might 
have had soldiers enough in England. For there were very 
few of the common people that cared much for either of 
the causes, but would have taken any side for pay or plunder. 
But the King's treasury wa s verv low, and^his enemies, that ^ 
pretended the people'sf ease from taxes, and other specious 
tEing^, had the command of the purses of the city of London, 
and of most cities and corporate towns in England^nd of 
many parti cular persons besides. 

B. But how came the people to be so corrupted ? And 
what kind of people were they that could so' seduce them ? 

A. The seducers were of divers sorts. One sort were 
ministers ; ministers, as they called themselves, of Christ ; 
and sometimes, in their sermons to the people, God's 
ambassadors; pretending to have a right from God to 
govern every one his parish and their assembly the whole 
nation. 

Secondly, there were a very great number, though not 

' that did so. 



BEHEMOTH. Zkatt^gueu 

tiade^ having in admiration the great proeperity of the Low 
Countries after they had revolted from their monarch, the 
King of Spain, were inclined to think that the like change 
of government here, would to them produce the like pros- 
perity. 

Sixthly, there were a very great number that had either 
wasted their fortunes, or thought them too mean for the 
good parts which they thought were in themselves; and 
more there were, that had able bodies, but saw no means 
how honestly to get their bread. These longed for a war, 
and hoped to maintain themselves hereafter by the lucky 
choosing of a party to side with, and consequently did for 
the most part serve under them that had greatest plenty of 
money. 

Lastly, the people in general were so ignorant o ftheir 

duty, as that not one perhaps of ten th ousand knew~wKat 

right any ma n had^tp_ command ^W or what necessity 

there was of King or Co mmonwealth, for which he was to 

part with his money against his will ; but thought himself 

to~be so much master of whatsoever he possessed, that it 

could not be taken from him upon any pretence of common 

safety without his own consent / King, they though t, wa s 

but a title of ^hehighest honour, which gentleman^ knight, 

baronfearl, duke, were^ut steps to ascend to, with the help 

of liclTes; they had no rule of equity, but precedents and 

custom'; and he wa$ thought wisest and fittest to be chosen 

for j^ Parliament that was .most averse to the granting^f 

subsidies or other public payments. 

r £. In such a constitution of people, methinks, the King 

\ is already ousted of his government, so as they needed not 

")r ^ have taken arms for it For I cannot imagine how the 

^King should come by any means to resist them. 

A, There was indeed very great difficulty in the business. 
But of that point you will be better informed in the pursuit 
of this narration. 

B. But I desire to know first, the several grounds of the 
pretences, both of the Pope and of the Presbyterians, by 



Diaiog9ti i. BEHEMOTH. 

which they daim a right to govern 0% ts they do^ in chief: 

II and after that, horn whence, and when, crept in the pretences 

of that Long Parliament, for a democracy. 

A. As for the Papists, they challenge this right fifom a* 
text in Deut xvii. X2, and other like texts, according to the 
old Latin translation in these words : And hi thai aui pf 
pride shall refuse to obey the eommandmeni cf that priesif 
which shall at that time minister before the Lord thy God^ 
that man shall by the sentence of the judge be fut to death. 
And because, as the Jews were the people of God then, so 
is all Christendom the people of God now, they infer from 
thence, that the Pope, whom they pretend to be the high- 
priest of all Christian people, ought also to be obeyed in all 
his decrees by all Christians, upon pain of death. Again, 
whereas in the New Testament (Matt xxviii. x8-2o) Christ 
saith : All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go 
therefore and teach all nations^ and baptize them in the name 
of the Father^ and of the Son^ and of the Holy Ghost^ and 
teach them to observe all these things which I have commanded 
you: from thence they infer, that the command of the 
apostles was to be obeyed, and by consequence the nations 
were bound to be governed by them, and especially by the 
prince of the apostles, St Peter, and by his successors, the 
Popes of Rome. 

B. For the text in the Old Testament, I do not see how 
the commandment of God to the Jews, to obey their priests, 
can be interpreted to have the like force in the case of 
other nations Christian, more than upon nations unchristian 
(for all the world are God's people) ; unless we also grant, 
that a king cannot of an infidel be made Christian, with- 
out making himself subject to the laws of that apostle, or 
priest, or minister, that shall convert him. The Jews were 
a peculiar people of God, a sacerdotal kingdom, and bound 
to no other law but what first Moses, and afterwards every 
high-priest, did go and receive immediately from the mouth 
of God in Mount Sinai, in the tabernacle of the ark, and in 
the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. And for the text in 



1 
BEHEMOTH. Dial^gui u 

St Matthew, I know the words in the Gospel are not io 
Uaeh^ but ^, fnaki Mmples ; and that there is a great 
difference between a subject and a disciple> and between 
teaching and commanding. And if such texts as these 
must be so interpreted, why do not Christian kings lay down 
their titles of majesty and sovereignty, and call themselves 
the Pope's lieutenants? But the doctors of the Romish 
Church seem to decline that title of absolute power in their 
distinction of power spiritual and temporal; but this dis- 
tinction I do not very well understand. 

A. By spiritual power they mean the power to determine 
points of faith, and to be judges, in the inner court of con- 
science, of moral duties, and a power to punish those men, 
that obey not their precepts, by ecclesiastical censure, that 
is, by excommunication. And this power, they say, the 
Pope hath immediately from Christ, without dependence 
on any king or sovereign assembly, whose subjects they 
be that stand excommunicate. But for the power temporal, 
which consists in judging and punishing those actions that 
are done against the civil laws, they say, they do not pretend 
to it directly, but only indirectly, that is to say, so far forth 
as such actions tend to the hindrance or advancement of 
religion and good manners, which they mean when they say 
in ordine ad spiritualia. 

B. What power then is left to Kings and other civil 
sovereigns, which the Pope may not pretend to be his in 
crdine ad spiritualia f 

A. None, or very little. [And this power not only the 
Pope pretends to in all Christendom ; but most bishops 
also, in their several dioceses, jure divinoy that is, imme- 
diately from Christ, without deriving it from the Pope.] ' 

B, But what if a man refuse obedience to this pretended 
power of the Pope and his bishops ? What harm can ex- 

■ Thiunieme: 'And this power . . . from the Voi^C though erased 
m thi MS, by Hobbes*s own hand^ is not wanting in the text of Edd,^ 
where it has : ' some of his bishops,' instead of ' most bishops.' 



Ditt^tu I. BEHEMOTH. 

• 

commonicatkm do hinit especially if he be the iab}ect of 
,f Another sovereign? 

A. Vtry great harm. For by the Fope% or bishbp^s 
signification of it to the civil powcTi he shall be punished 
sufficiently. 

B. He were in an ill case then, that adventured to write 
or speak in defence of the civil power» that must be 
punished by him whose rights he defended, like Uzza, that 
was slain because he would needs, unbidden, put forth his 
hand to keep the ark from Ming. But if a whole nation 
should revolt fix)m the Pope at once, what effect could ex« 
communication have upon the nation? 

A, AVhy, they should have no more mass said, at least by 
any of the Pope's priests. Besides, the Pope would have . 
no more to do with them, but cast them off, and so they 
would be in the same case as if a nation should be cast off 
by their king, and left to be governed by themselves, or 
whom they would. 

B. This would not be taken so much for a punbhment 
to the people, as to the King ; and therefore when a Pope 
excommunicates a whole nation, methinks he rather ex- 
communicates himself than them. But I pray you tell me, 
what were the rights the Pope pretended to in the king- 
doms of other princes ? 

A, First, an exemption of all priests, friars, and monks, 
in criminal causes, from the cognizance of civil judges. 
Secondly, collation of benefices on whom he pleased, native 
or stranger, and exaction of tenths, first fruits, and other 
payments. Thirdly, appeals to Rome in all causes where 
the Church could pretend to be concerned. Fourthly, to 
be the supreme judge concerning lawfulness of marriage, 
that is, concerning the hereditary succession of Kings, and 
to have the cognizance of all causes concerning adultery 
and fornication. 

B, Good ! A monopoly of women. 
A. Fifthly, a power of absolving subjects of their duties, 

and of their oaths of fidelity to their lawful sovereigns, wRen 
the Pope should think fit for the extirpation of heresy. 



DMomi I. 

B. This power of absolving subjects of their obedience, 
as also that other of being judge of manners and doctrine, 
is as absolute a sovereignty as is possible to be ; and conse- 
quently there must be two kingdoms in one and the same 
nation, and no man be able to know which of his masters he 
must obey. 

A. For my part, I should rather obey that master that had 
the right of making laws and of inflicting punishments, than 
him that pretendeth only to a right of making canons (that 
is to say rules) and no right of co-action, or otherwise 
punishing, but by excommunication. 

B. But the Pope pretends also that his canons are laws ; 
and for punishing, can there be greater than excommunica- 
tion ; supposing it true, as the Pope saith it is, that he that 
dies excommunicate is damned? Which supposition, it 
seems, you believe not ; else you would rather have chosen 
to obey the Pope, that would cast your body and soul into 
hell, than the King, that can only kill the body. 

A* You say true. For it were very uncharitable in me to 
believe that all Englishmen, except a few Papists, that have 
been bom and called heretics ever since the Reformation of 
Religion in England, should be damned 

B, But for those that die excommunicate in the Church 
of England at this day, do you not think them also dammed ? 

A. Doubtless, he that dies in sin without repentance is 
damned, and he that is excommunicate for disobedience to 
the King's laws, either spiritual or temporal, is excommuni- 
cate for sin ; and therefore, if he die excommunicate and 
without desire of reconciliation, he dies impenitent You 
see what follows. But to die in disobedience to the pre- 
cepts anddoctrines of those men that have no authority or 
jurisdiction over us, is quite another case, and bringeth no 
such.danger with it. 

B. But what is this heresy, which the Church of Rome so 
cruelly persecutes, as to depose Kings that do not, when 
they are bidden, turn all heretics out of their dominions ? 

^ A. Heresy is a word which, when it is used without

passion, signifies a private opinion. So the different lecto 
of the old philosophers, Academians^ Peripatetics^ Epico* 
reans, Stoics, &c, were c^led heresies. But in the Chrbtian 
Church, there was in the signification of that word, compre- 
hended a sinful opposition to him, that was chief judge of 
j doctrines in order to the salvation of men's souls ; and coo- 
\ sequently heresy may be said to bear the same relation to 
the power spiritual, that rebellion doth to the power temporal, 
and is suitable to be persecuted by him that will preserve a 
power spiritual and dominion of men's consciences 

B, It would be very well (because we are all of us per- 
mitted to read the Holy Scriptures, and bound to make 
them the rule of our actions, both public and private) 
that heresy were by some law defined, and the particular 
opinions set forth, for which a man were to be condemned 
and punished as a heretic ; for else, not only men of mean 
capacity, but even the wisest and devoutest Christian, may 
fall into heresy without any will to oppose the Church ; for 
the Scriptures are hard, and the interpretations different of 
different men. 

A, The meaning of the word heresy is by law declared in 
an Act of Parliament in the first year of Queen Elizabeth ; 
wherein it is ordained, that the persons who had by the 
Queen's letters-patent the authority spiritual, meaning the 
High Commission, shall not have authority to adjudge any 
f natter or cause to be heresy ^ but only such as heretofore have 
been adjudged to be heresy by the authority of the canonical 
Scriptures^ or by the first four general CouncilSy or by any 
other general Council y where the same was declared heresy by 
the express and plain words of the said canonical Scriptures^ 
or such as hereafter shall be adjudged heresy by the high 
court of Parliament of this realm^ with the assent of the 
clergy in their convocation, 

B. It seems therefore, if there arise any new error that 
hath not yet been declared heresy (and many such may 
arise), it cannot be judged heresy without a Parliament. 
For how foul soever the error be, it cannot have been 



lo BEHEMOTH. DMogiti \. 

declared heresy neither in the Scriptures nor in the Councils ; 
because it was never before heard o£ And consequently 
there can be no error, unless it fall within the compass of 
blasphemy against God or treason against the King, for 
whidi a man can in equity be punished. Besides, who can 
tell what is declared by the Scripture, which every man is 
allowed to read and interpret to himself? Nay more, what 
Protestant, either of the laity or clergy, if every general 
Council can be a competent judge of heresy, is not already 
condemned? For divers Councils have declared a great 
many of our doctrines to be heresy, and that, as they pre- 
tend, upon the authority of the Scriptures. 

A. What are those points, that the first four general 
Councils have declared heresy? 

B. The first general Council, held at Nicsea, declared all 
to be heresy which was contrary to the Nicene Creed, upon 
occasion of the heresy of Arius, which was the denying the 
divinity of Christ The second general Council, held at 
Constantinople, declared heresy the doctrine of Macedonius ; 
which was that the Holy Ghost was created. The third 
Council, assembled at Ephesus, condemned the doctrine 
of Nestorius, that there were two persons in Christ The 
fourth, held at Chalcedon, condemned the error of Eutyches, 
that there was but one nature in Christ. I know of no 
other points condemned in these four Councils, but such as 
concern church-government, or the same doctrines taught by 
other men in other words. And these Councils were all 
called by the Emperors, and by them their decrees con- 
firmed at the petition of the Councils themselves. 

A. I see by this, that both the calling of the Council, and 
the confirmation of their doctrine and church-government, 
had no obligatory force but from the authority of the 
Emperor. How comes it then to pass, that they take upon 
them now a legislative power, and say their canons are 
laws f That text, all power is given to me in heaven and 
earthy had the same force then as it hath now, and conferred 
a legislative power on the Councils, not only over Christian 
men, but ""also*^ over all nations in the world.

the temporal rights of all other princes of the west; and so 
continued gaining upon them, till his power was at the 
highest in that three hundred years, or thereabout, which 
passed between the eighth and eleventh century, that is, be-, 
tween Pope Leo the Third and Pope Innocent the Third* 
For in this time Pope Zachary the First deposed Chilperic, 
then King of France, and gave the kingdom to one of his 
subjects, Pepin; and Pepin took from the Lombards a great 
part of their territory and gave it to the ChurdL Shortly 
after, the Lombards having recovered their estate, Charles 
the Great retook it, and gave it to the Church again ; and 
Pope Leo the Third made Charles Emperor. 

B. But what right did the Pope then pretend for the 
creating of an Emperor? 

A. He pretended the right of being Christ's vicar; and 
what Christ could give, his vicar might give ; and you know 
that Christ was King of all the world. 

B. Yes, as God; and so he g.iyes all the kingdoms of 
the.worldj^which nevertheless proceed from the consent of 
people, either for fear or hope. 

A. But this gift of the empire was in a more special 
manner, in such a manner as Moses had the government of 
Israel given him ; or rather as Joshua had it given him, to 
go in and out before the people as the high-priest should 
direct him. And so the empire was understood to be given 
him, on condition to be directed by the Pope. For when 
the Pope invested him with the regal ornaments, the people 
all cried out Deus dat^ that is to say, it is God thai gives 
it; and the Emperor was contented so to take it And from 
that time, all or most of the Christian Kings do put into 
their titles the words Dei gratia^ that is, by the gift of God ; 
and their successors use still to receive the crown and 
sceptre from a bishop. 

B. It is certainly a very good custom, for Kings to be 
put in mind by whose gift they reign ; but it cannot from 
that custom be inferred that they receive the kingdom 
by mediation of the Pope, or by any other clergy ; for 



BEHEMOTH. Dial^gta v 



was a name common to all Kings. Is not he a bishop 
now, to whom God hath committed the chaige of all the 
souls of his subjects, both of the laity and the clergy ? And 
though he be in relation to our Saviour, who is the chief 
pastor, but a sheep^ yet, compared to his own subjects, they 
are all sheep^ both laic and cleric, and he only shepherd 
And seeing a Christian bishop is but a Christian endued 
with power to govern the clergy, it follows that every Chris- 
tian king is not only a bishop, but an arch-bishop, and his 
whole dominion his diocese. And though it were granted, 
that imposition of hands is necessary from a priest; yet, see* 
ing Kings have the government of the dergy, that are his 
subjects even before baptism ; the baptism itself, wherein he 
is received as a Christian, is a sufficient imposition of hands, 
so that whereas before he was a bishop, now he is a Chris- 
tian bishop. 

A. For my part I agree with you : this prohibition of 
marriage to priests came in about the time of Pope Gregory 
the Seventh, and William the First, King of England ; by 
which means the Pope had in England, what with secular 
and what with regular priests, a great many lusty bachelors 
at his service. 

Secondly, that auricular confession to a priest was neces- 
sary to salvcUion. It is true that, before that time, confes- 
sion to a priest was usual, and performed for the most part 
by him that confessed, in writing. But that use was taken 
away about the time of King Edward III., and priests 
commanded to take confessions from the mouth of the 
confitent : and men did generally believe, that without con- 
fession and absolution before their departure out of the 
world, they could not be saved ; and having absolution from 
a priest, that they could not be damned. You understand 
by this, how much every man would stand in awe of the 
Pope and clergy, more than they would of the King ; and 
what inconvenience it is to a state for their subjects to con- 
fess their secret thoughts to spies. 

B. Yes, as much as eternal torture is more terrible than 



x6 BEHEMOTH. DtaloiHiU 

the obedience to the Church of Rome ; buti on the con« 
tnu7» whatsoever might give advantage to it against the civil 
power* Besides, they privately insinuated themselves with 
women and men of weak judgment, confirming their 
adherence to the Pope, and urging them, in the time of 
their sickness, to be beneficial to the Church ' by contribu« 
don of money, or building religious houses, or pious works 
and necessary for the remission of their sins. 

A I do not remember that I have read of any kingdom 
or state in the world, where liberty was given to any private 
man to call the people together, and make orations to 
them frequently, or at all, without first making the state 
acquainted, except only in Christendom. I believe the 
heathen Kings foresaw, that a few such orators would be 
able to make a great sedition. Moses did indeed command 
to read the Scriptures and expound them in the Synagogues 
every Sabbath-day. But the Scriptures then were nothing 
else but the laws of the nation, delivered unto them by 
Moses himself. And I believe it would do no hurt, if the 
laws of England also were often read and expounded in the 
several congregations of Englishmen, at times appointed, that 
they may know what to do ; for they know already what 
to believe. 

A, I think that neither the preaching of friars nor monks, 
nor of parochial priests, tended to teach men what, but 
whom to believe. For the power of the mighty hath no 
foundation but in the opinion and belief of the people. 
And~the^end which the Pope had in multiplying sermons, 
was no other but to prop and enlarge his own authority 
over all Christian Kings and States. 

Within the same time, that is, between the time of the 
Emperor Charles the Great and of King Edward the Third 
of England, began their second polity \ which was, to bring 
religion into an art, and thereby to maintain all the decrees 
of tlie Roman Church, by disputation, not only firom the 
Scriptures, but also from the philosophy of Aristotle, both

take the pains to examine. So that all sorts of people were 
fully resolved, that both the doctrine was true, and the 
Pope's authority no more than was due to him. 

^. I see that a Christian king, or state, how well soever 
provided he be of money and arms, where the Church of 
Rome hath such authority, will have but a hard match of it, 
for want of men. For their subjects will hardly be drawn 
into the field and fight with courage against their con- 
sciences. 

A. It is true that great rebellions have been raised by 
Church-men in the Pope's quarrel against kings, as in 

. England against King John, and in France against King 
Henry IV. ^Vherein the Kings had a more considerable 
part on their sides, than the Pope had on his; and shall 
always have so, if they have money. For there are but few 
whose consciences are so tender as to refuse money when 
they want it. But the great mischief done to kings upon 
pretence of religion is, when the Pope gives power to one 
king to invade another. 

B. I wonder how King Henry the Eighth could then so 
utterly extinguish the authority of the Pope in England, and 
that without any rebellion at home, or any invasion from 
abroad. 

A. First, the priests, monks, and friars, being in the 
height of their power, were now for the most part grown 
insolent and licentious ; and thereby the force of their 
arguments was now taken away by the scandal of their lives, 
which the gentry and men of good education easily per- 
ceived : and the Parliament consisting of such persons, was 
therefore willing to take away their power : and generally 
the common people, which from a long custom had been . 
in love with Parliaments, were not displeased therewith. ^ 
Secondly, the doctrine of Luther beginning a little before,/^ 
was now by a great many men of the greatest judgment so 
well received, as that there was no hope to restore the Pope 
to his power by rebellion. Thirdly, the revenue of abbeys y 
and all other religious houses, falling thereby into the King's

M ^ hands, and by him being disposed of to die most eminent 
I? v gentlemen in every county, could not but make them do* 






their best to confirm themselves in the possession of then^. 
Fourthly, King Henry was of a nature quick and severe in 
the punishing of such as should be the first to oppose his 
designs. Lastly, as to invasion from abroad, in case the 
Pope had given the kingdom to another princ^ it had been 
in vain ; for England is another manner of kingdom than 
Navarre. Besides, the French and Spanish forces were 
employed at that time one against another: and though 
they had been at leisure, they would have found perhaps no 
better success than the Spaniards found afterwards in 1588. 
Nevertheless, notwithstanding the insolence, avarice, and 
hypocrisy of the then clergy, and notwithstanding the doc« 
trine of Luther, if the Pope had not provoked the King by 
endeavouring to cross his marriage with his second wife, his 
authority might have remained in England till there had 
risen some other quarrel 

B. Did not the bishops, that then were, and had taken 
an oath, wherein was, amongst other things, that they should 
defend and maintain the Regal Rights of St. Peter (the 
words are, Regalia Sancti Fetn\ which nevertheless some 
have said are reguias Sancti Fein\ that is to say, St. Peter's 
Rules or Doctrine ; and that the clergy afterward did read it, 
being perhaps written in short-hand, by a mistake to the 
Pope's advantage regalia): did not, I say, the bishops 
oppose that Act of Parliament against the Pope, and against 
the taking of the oath of supremacy ? 

A, No, I do not find the bishops did many of them 
oppose the King ; for having no power without him, it had 
been great imprudence to provoke his anger. There was 
besides a controversy in those times between the Pope and 
the bishops, most of which did maintain that they exercised 
their jurisdiction episcopal in the right of God, as imme- 
diately as the Pope himself did exercise the same over the 
whole Church. And because they saw that by this Act of 
the King's in Pariiament they were to hold their power no 



BEHEMOTH. THaUjciu i. 

more of the Pope, and never thought of holding it of the 
King, they were perhaps better content to let that Act of 
Parliament pass. I n the reign of King Edward VI. the 
doctrine of Luther had taken so great root in England^-that 
they threw out also a great many of the Pope's new articles 
of faith ; which Queen Mary succeeding him restored again, 
together with all that had been abolished by Henry VIII., 
saving (that which could not be restored) the religious 
houses ; and the bishops and clergy of King Edward were 
partly burnt for heretics, partly fled, and partly recanted. 
And they that fled betook diemselves to those places beyond 
sea, where the reformed religion was either protected or not 
persecuted ; who, after the decease of Queen Mary, returned 
a^ain to favour and preferment under Queen Elizabeth, that 
yrestored the religion of her brother King Edward. And so 
/it hath continued till this day, excepting the interruption 
/ made in this late rebellion of the presbyterians and other 
/ democratical mea But though the Romish religion were 
now cast out by the law, yet there were abundance of people, 
and many of them of the nobility, that still retained the 
religion of their ancestors, who as they were not much 
molested in points of conscience, so they were not by their 
own inclination very troublesome to the civil government ; 
but by the secret practice of the Jesuits and other emissaries 
of the Roman Church, they were made less quiet than they 
ought to have been ; and some of them to venture on the 
most horrid act that ever had been heard of before, I mean 
the Gunpowder Treason. And upon that account, the 
Papists of England have been looked upon as men that 
would not be sorry for any disorders here that might 
possibly make way to the restoring of the Pope's authority. 
And therefore I named them for one of the distempers of 
the state of England in the time of our late King Charles. 

B. I see that Monsieur Mornay du Plessis, and Dr. 
Morton, Bishop of Durham, ^Titing of the progress of the 
Pope's power, and intituling their books, one of them, 
"The Mystery of Iniquity," the other, "The Grand Impos- 



..id 



IHaiegut I, 

ture," were both in the right. For I believe there was never 
such another cheat in the «'orId, and I wonder that the 
Kings and Sutes of Christendom never perceived it 

A. It is manifest they did perceive it How else durst 
they make war, 'as they have done*, against the Pope, and 
some of them take him out of Rome itself and cany him 
away prisoner? But if they would have freed themselves 
from his tyranny, they should have agreed together, and 
made themselves every one, as Henry VIII. did, head of the 
Church within their own respective dominions. But not agree- 
ing, they let his power continue, every one hoping to make 
use of it, when there should be cause, against his neighbour. 

B. Now, as to that other distemper by Presbyterians, 
how came their power to be so great, being of themselves, 
for the most part, but so many poor scholars ? 

A. This controversy between the Papist and the Reformed 
Churches could not choose but make every man, to the 
best of his power, examine by the Scriptures, which of them 
was in the right ; and to that end they were translated into 
vulgar languages ; whereas before, the translation of them was 
not allowed, nor any man to read them but such as had 
express license so to da For the Pope did concerning the 
Scriptures the same that Moses did concerning Mount 
Sinai. Moses suffered no man to go up to it to hear God 
speak or gaze upon him, but such as he himself took with 
him ; and the Pope suffered none to speak with God in the 
Scriptures, that had not some part of the Pope's spirit in 
him, for which he might be trusted. 

B. Certainly Moses did therein very wisely, and accord- 



23 BEHEMOTH. Diai0gU€i. 

Refonned Church here^and to the bishops and pastors there- 
in, was cast off; and every man became a judge of religion, 
and an interpreter of the Scriptures to himselfl 

B. Did not the Church of England intend it should be 
so ? What other end could they have in recommending the 
Bible to me, if they did not mean I should make it the rule 
of my actions ? Else they might have kept it, though open 
to themselves, to me sealed up in Hebrew, Greek, and 
Latin, and fed me out of it in such measure as had been 
requisite for the salvation of my soul and the Church's 
peace. 

A. I confess this licence of interpreting the Scripture was 
the cause of so many several sects, as having lain hid till 
the beginning of the late King's reign, did then appear to 
the disturbance of the commonwealth. But to return to 
the story. Those persons that fled for religion in the time 
of Queen Mary, resided, for the most part, in places where 
the Reformed religion was professed and governed by an 
assembly of ministers \ who also were not a little made use 
of (for want of better statesmen), in points of civil govern- 
ment Which pleased so much the English and Scotch 
Protestants that lived amongst them, that at their return 
they wished there were the same honour and reverence 
given to the ministry in their own countries. *And* in 
Scotland (King James being then young) soon (with the 
help of some of the powerful nobility) they brought it to 
pass. Also they that returned into England in the begin- 
ning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, endeavoured the 
same here, but could never effect it till this last rebellion, 
nor without the aid of the Scots. And it was no sooner 
effected, but they were defeated again by the other sects, 
which, by the preaching of the Presbyterians and private 
interpretation of Scripture, were grown numerous. 

B. I know indeed that in the beginning of the late war, 
the power of the Presbyterians was so very great, that, not 
only the citizens of London were almost all of them at their 
devotion, but also the greatest part of all other cities and 



t

market-towns of EnghinL But yon htve not yet told me 
by what art and what d^jees they became so strongs 

A. It was not their own art alone that did i^ bat they 
had the concurrence of a great m any gentlemen, th at did 
no less desire a popular g*^iN*n"«yTit in thft ^^y*^ ftftte than 
these ministers did in the Qiurrh. And as these did in 
the pulpit draw the people to their opinions, and to a dislike 
of the Church-govemmenty Canons, and Common-prayer- 
book, so did the other make them in love with democracy 
by their harangues in the Parliament, and by their discourses 
and communication with people in the country, continually 
extolling liberty and inveighing against tyranny, leaving the 
people to collect of themselves that this tyranny was the 
present government of the state. And as the Presbyterians 
brought with them into their churches their divinity from 
the universities, so did many of the gentlemen bring their 
politics from thence into the Parliament; but neither of 
them did this very boldly during the time of Queen Elizabeth. 
And though it be not likely that all of them did it out of 
malice, but many of them out of error, yet certainly the 
chief leaders were ambitious ministers and ambitious gentle- 
men ; the ministers envying the authority of bishops, whom 
they thought less learned ; and the gentlemen envying the 
privy-<:ouncii and principal courtiers, whom they thought 
less wise than themselves. For it is a hard matter for men, 
who do all think highly of their own wits, when they have 
also acquired the learning of the university, to be persuaded 
that they want any ability requisite for the government of a 
commonwealth, especially having read the glorious histories 
and the sententious politics of the ancient popular govern- 
ments of the Greeks and Romans, amongst whom kings 
were hated and branded with the name of tyrants, and 
popular government (though no tyrant was ever so cruel as 
a popular assembly) passed by the name of liberty. The 
Presbyterian ministers, in the beginning of the reign of 
Queen Elizabeth, did not (because they durst not) publicly 
*and plainly* preach against the discipline of the Church. But 



BEHEMOTH. DUOogm u 

not l<nig after> by the favour perhaps of some great courtieri 
they went abroad preaching in most of the market-towns of 
England, as the preaching friars had formerly done, upon 
working-days in the morning ; in which sermons, these and 
others of the same tenets, that had charge of souls, both by 
the manner and matter of their preaching, applied themselves 
wholly to the winning of the people to a liking of their 
doctrines and good opinion of their persons. 

And first, for the manner of their preaching; they so 
framed their countenance and gesture at their entrance into 
the pulpit, and their pronunciation both in their prayer and 
sermon, and used the Scripture phrase (whether understood 
by the people or not), as that no tragedian in the world 
could have acted the part of a right godly man better than 
these did; insomuch as a man unacquainted with such 
art, could never suspect any ambitious plot in them to raise 
sedition against the state, as they then had designed ; or 
doubt that the vehemence of their voice (for the same words 
with the usual pronunciation had been of liule force) and 
forcedness of their gesture and looks, could arise from 
anything else but zeal to the service of God. And by this 
art they came into such credit, that numbers of men used 
to go forth of their own parishes and towns on working- 
days, leaving their calling, and on Sundays leaving their 
own churches, to hear them preach in other places, and to 
despise their own and all other preachers that acted not so 
well as they. And as for those ministers that did not usually 
preach, but instead of sermons did read to the people such 
homilies as the Church had appointed, they esteemed and 
called them dumd dogs. 

Secondly, for the matter of their sermons, because the 
anger of the people in the late Roman usurpation was then 
fresh, they saw there could be nothing more gracious with 
them than to preach against such other points of the Romish 
religion as the bishops had not yet condemned; that so 
receding further from popery than they did, they might with 
glory to themselves leave a suspicion on the bishops, as men 
not yet well purged from idolatry.

endeavoured to keep themselves from undeamiess only, or 
at least from the scandal of it* And, whereas they did, 
both in their sermons and writings, maintain and inculcate, 
that the very first motions of the mind, that is to say, the 
delight men and women took in the sight of one another's 
form, though they checked the proceeding thereof so that 
it never grew up to be a design, was nevertheless a sin, 
they brought young men into desperation and to think 
themselves damned, because they could not (which no man 
can, and is contrary to the constitution of nature) behold 
a delightful object without delight And by this means 
they became confessors to such as were thus troubled in 
conscience, and were obeyed by them as their spiritual 
doctors in all cases of conscience. 

B. Yet divers of them did preach frequently against 
oppression. 

A, It is true, I had forgot that ; but it was before such 
as were free enough from it ; I mean the common people, 
who would easily believe themselves oppressed, but never 
oppressors. And therefore you may reckon this among 
their artifices, to. make the people believe they were op- 
pressed by the King, or perhaps by the bishops, or both ; 
and incline the meaner sort to their party afterwards, when 
there should be occasion. But this was but sparingly done 
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, whose fear and jealousy 
they were afraid of. Nor had they as yet any great power 
in the Parliament-house, whereby to call in question her 
prerogative by petitions of right and other devices, as they 
did allerwards, when democratical gentlemen had received 
them into their counsels for the design of changing the 
government from monarchical to popular, which they called 
liberty. 

B. Who would think that such horrible designs as these 
could so easily and so long remain covered with the cloak 
of godliness ? For that they were most impious hypocrites, 
is manifest enough by the war their proceedings ended in, 
and by the impious acts in that war committed. But when

\ ^. As to the time of attempting die change of govern*

'ffiven from Londo n by tumults raised in that dtv against 
Turn, and retireSTlbr the security of his person to York ; 
^ere he had^not been many (lays, when they sent unto him 
nineteen propositions, whereof above a dozen were demands 
of several powers, essential ports of the power sovereign. 
But before that time they had demanded some of them in 
I a petition which they called a Petition of Right ; which 

j| nevertheless the King had granted them in a former Parlia- 

ment, though he deprived himself thereby, not only of the 
power to levy money without their consent, but also of his 
ordinary revenue by custom of tonnage and poundage, and 
of the liberty to put into custody such men as he thought 
likely to disturb the peace and raise sedition in the kingdom. 
As for the men that did this, it is enough to say they were 
members of the last Parliament, and of some other Par- 
liaments in the beginning of King Charles and the end of 
King James his reign; to name them all is not necessary, 
further than the story shall require. Most of them were 
members of the House of Commons; some few also, of 
the I^rds ; but all, such as had a great opinion of their 
sufficiency in politics, which they thought was not sufficiently 
taken notice of by the King. 

B, How could the Parliament, when the King had a 
great navy, and a great number of trained soldiers, and all 
the magazines of ammunition in his power, be able to begin 
the war ? 

A, The King had these things indeed in his right ; but 
that signifies little, when they that had the custody of the 
navy and magazines, and with them all the trained soldiers, 
and in a manner all his subjects, were by the preaching of

Presbyterian ministen^ an4 the seditious whisperings of 
false and ignorant politicians, made his enemies; and when 
the King could have no money but ¥ihat the Parliament 
should give him, which you may be sure should not be 
enough to maintain his regal power, which they intended 
to take from him. And yet, I think, they never would 
have ventured into the field, but for that unlucky business 
of imposing upon the Scots, who were all Presbyterians, 
our book of Common-prayer. For I believe the English 
would never have taken well that the Parliament should 
make war upon the King, upon any provocation, unless it 
were in their own defence, in case the King should first 
make war upon them ; and, therefore, it behoved them to 
provoke the King, that he might do something that might 
look like hostility. 

It happened in the year 1637, that the King, by the advice, 
as it was thought, of the Archbishop of Canterbury, sent 
down a book of Common-prayer into Scotland, not differing 
in substance from ours, nor much in words besides the putting 
of the word Presbyter for that of Minister, commanding it to 
be used (for conformity with this kingdom) by the ministers 
there, for an ordinary form of Divine service. This 
being read in the church at Edinburgh, caused such a 
tumult there, that he that read it had much ado to escape 
with his life ; and gave occasion to the greatest part of the 
nobility and others to enter, by their own authority, into 
a Covenant amongst themselves, which impudently they 
called a Cm^nant with Gad^ to put down episcopacy, with- 
out consulting viiih the King : which they presently did, 
animated thereto by their own confidence, or by assurance 
from some of the democratical Englishmen that in former 
Parliaments had been the greatest opposers of the King's 
interests, that the King would not be able to raise an army 
to chastise them without calling a Parliament, which would 
be sure to favour them. For the thing which those 
democraticals chiefly then aimed at, was to force the King 
to call a Parliament, which he had not done for ten years

they are made bishops) be their fellows. Secondly, that 
from the emulation of glory between the nations, they 
might be willing to see this nation afflicted by civil war, 
and might hope, by aiding the rebels here, to acquire some 
power over the English, at least so far as to establish here 
the Presbyterian discipline; which was also one of the 
points they afterwards openly demanded Lastly, they 
might hope for, in the war, some great sum of money, as a 
reward of their assistance, besides great booty, which they 
afterwards obtained. But whatsoever was the cause of their 
hatred to bishops, the pulling of them down was not all 
they aimed at : if it had, now that episcopacy was abolished 
by act of Parliament, they would have rested satisfied, 
which they did not For after the King was returned to 
London, the English Presbyterians and democraticals, by 
whose favour they had put down bishops in Scotland, 
thought it reason to have the assistance of the Scotch for 
the pulling down of bishops in England. And in order 
thereunto, they might perhaps deal with the Scots secretly, 
to rest unsatisfied with that pacification, which they were 
before contented with. Howsoever it was, not long after 
the King was returned to London, they sent up to some of 
their friends at court a certain paper, containing, as they 
pretended, the articles of the said pacification ; a false and 
scandalous paper, which was by the King's command burnt, 
as I have heard, publicly. And so both parties returned to 
the same condition they were in, when the King went down 
with his army. 

B. And so there was a great deal of money cast away to 
no purpose. But you have not told me who was general of 
that army. 

A. I told you the King was there in person. He that 
commanded under him was the Earl of Arundel, a man 
that w*anted not either valour or judgment. But to proceed 
to battle or to treaty, was not in his power, but in the King's. 

B. He was a man of a most noble and loyal family, and 
whose ancestor had formerly given a great overthrow to the

master. — This resolution of the Scots to enter England 
being known, the King wanting money to raise an army 
against them, was now, as his enemies here wished, con- 
strained to call a parliament, to meet at Westminster the 
13th day of April, 1640. 

B. Methinks a Parliament of England, if upon any 
occasion, should furnish the King with money now, in a war 
against the Scots, out of an inveterate disaffection to that 
nation that had always anciently taken part with their 
enemies the French, and which always esteemed the glory 
of England for an abatement of their own. 

A. It is indeed commonly seen that neighbour nations 
envy one another's honour, and that the less potent bears 
the greater malice ; but that hinders them not from agreeing 
in those things which their common ambition leads them to. 
And therefore the King found not the more, but the less 
help from this Parliament : and most of the members there- 
of, in their ordinary discourses, seemed to wonder why the 
King should make a war upon Scotland; and in that 
Parliament sometimes called them their brethren the Scots. 
But instead of taking the King's business, which was the 
raising of money, into their consideration, they fell upon 
the redressing of grievances, and especially such ways of 
levying money as in the late intermission of Parliaments the 
King had been forced to use ; such as were ship-money, for 
knighthood, and such other vails (as one may call them) of 
the regal office, which lawyers had found justifiable by the 
ancient records of the kingdom. Besides, they fell upon the 
actions of divers ministers of state, though done by the 
King's own command and warrant. Insomuch, that before 
they were to come to the business for which they were called, 
the money which was necessary for this war (if they had 
given any, as they never meant to do) had come too late. 
It is true, there was mention of a sum of money to be given 
the King, by way of bargain, for the relinquishing of his 
right to ship-money, and some other of his prerogatives, but 
so seldom, and without determining any sum, that it was in

of other nations where they resided. Why were not the 
Scotch and English united in like manner into one people? 

A. King James at his first coming to the crown of 
England did endeavour it» but could not prevail But for 
all thaty I believe the Scots have now as many privileges in 
England as any nation had in Rome^ of those which were 
so as you say made Romans. For they are all naturalized, 
and have right to buy land in England to themselves and 
their heirs. 

B. It is true of them, that were bom in Scotland after 
the time that King James was in possession of the kingdom 
of England. 

A. There be very few now that were bom before. But 
why have they a better right that were bom after, than they 
that were born before? 

B. Because they were born subjects to the King of 
England, and the rest not 

A. Were not the rest bom subjects to King James? And 
was not he King of England ? 

B. Yes, but not then. 

A. I understand not the subtilty of that distinction. But 
upon what law is that distinction grounded? Is there any 
statute to that purpose ? 

B. I cannot tell ; I think not ; but it is grounded upon 
equity. 

^. I see little equity in this : that those nations that are 
bound to equal obedience to the same King, should not 
have equal privileges. And now seeing there be so very 
few bom before King James's coming in, what greater 
privilege had those ingrafted Romans by their naturalization 
in the state of Rome, or in the state of England the English 
themselves, more than the Scots ? 

B. Those Romans, when any of them were in Rome, had 
their voice in the making of laws. 

A. And the Scots have their Parliaments, wherein their 
assent is required to the laws there made, which is as good. 
Have not many of the provinces of France their several 



Dialegui r. BEHEMOTH. 

ptrliaments and levenl oonsdtiitioiis? And jret thqr are 
all equally natural subjects of the King of Fhuioe. And 
therefore for my part I thmk they were mistaken, both 
English and Scots, in calling one another foreigners. How- 
soever that be^ the King had a very sufficient army, where* 
with he marched towards Scotland ; and by the time he was 
come to York, the Scotch army was drawn up to the 
frontiers and ready to march into England ; which also they 
presently did ; giving out all the way, that their march should 
be without damage to the country, and that thdr errand 
was only to deliver a petition to the King, for the redren of 
many pretended injuries they had received from such of the 
court, whose counsel the King most followed. So they 
passed through Northumberland quietly, till they came to a 
ford in the river of Tyne, a little above Newcastle^ where 
they found some little opposition, from a party of the King^s 
army sent thither to stop them; whom the Scots easily 
mastered ; and as soon as they were over, seized upon New- 
castle, and coming further on, upon the city of Durham ; 
and sent to the King to desire a treaty, which was granted ; 
and the commissioners on both sides met at Ripon. The 
conclusion was, that all should be referred to the Parlia- 
ment, which the King should call to meet at Westminster 
on the 3rd of November following, being in the same year 
1640; and thereupon the King returned to London. 

B, So the armies were disbanded ? 

A, No; the Scotch army was to be defrayed by the 
counties of Northumberland and Durham, and the King 
was to pay his own, till the disbanding of both should be 
I ; agreed upon in Parliament. 

\ ^. So in effect both the armies were maintained at the 

King's charge, and the whole controversy to be decided by 
a Parliament almost wholly Presbyterian, and as partial to 
the Scotch as themselves could have wished. 

A. And yet for all this they durst not presently make 
I war upon the King : there was so much yet left of reverence 

to him in the hearts of the people, as to have made them

odioui^ if they had declared what they intended. They 
must have some colour or other to make it believed that the 
King made war first upon the Parliament And besides, 
they had not' yet sufficiently disgraced him and his actions 
m sermons and pamphlets, nor removed from about him 
those they thought could best counsel him. Therefore they 
resolved to proceed with him like skilful hunters ; first to 
single him out, by men disposed in all parts to drive him 
into the open fidd *with their noise,* and then in case he 
should but seem to turn head, to call that a making of war 
against the Parliament. 

And first they called in question such as had either 
preached or written in defence of any of those rights, which, 
belonging to the Crown, they meant to usurp, and take 
from the King to themselves : whereupon some few preachers 
and writers were imprisoned.' The King not protecting 
these, they proceeded to call in question some of the King's 
own actions in his ministers, whereof they imprisoned some, 
and some went beyond sea. And whereas certain persons, 
having endeavoured by books and sermons to raise sedition, 
and committed other crimes of high nature, had therefore 
been censured by the King's council in the Star-chamber, 
and imprisoned ; the Parliament by their own authority, to 
try, it seems, how the King and the people would take it 
(for their persons were inconsiderable), ordered their setting 
at liberty ; which was accordingly done, with great applause 
of the people, that flocked about them in London, in 
manner of a triumph. This being done, without resistance, 
*they called in question* the King's right to ship-money — 

B. Ship-money ! what's that ? 

A. The Kings of England, for the defence of the sea, had 
power to tax all the counties of England, whether they were 
maritime or not, for the building and furnishing of ships ; 
which tax the King had then lately found cause to impose, 
and the Parliament exclaimed against it as an oppression.

not to exempt any man from payments to the public, but 
for securing every man from such as abused the King*8 
power, by surreptitiously obtaining the King's warrants, to 
the oppressing of those against whom he had any suit in 
law. But it was conducing to the ends of some rebellious 
spirits in this Parliament, to have it interpreted in the wrong 
sense, and suitable enough to the understanding of the rest, 
or most part of them, to let it pass. 

£. You make the members of that Parliament very simple 
men; and yet the people chose them for the wisest of the 
land. 

ji. If craft be wisdom, they were wise enough. But wise, 
^ ' as I define it, is he that knows how to bring his business to 
pass (without the assistance of knavery and ignoble shifts) 
by the sole strength of his good contrivance. A fool may 
win from a better gamester, by the advantage of false dice, 
and packing of cards. 

B. According to your definition, there be few wise men 
«-^ • now-a-days. Such wisdom is a kind of gallantry, that few are 
brought up to, and most think folly. Fine clothes, great 
feathers, civility towards men that will not swallow injuries, 
<^ and injury towards them that will, is the present gallantry. 
But when the Parliament afterwards, having gotten the 
power into their hands, levied money for their own use ; 
what said the people to that? 

A. What else, but that it was legal and to be paid, as 
being imposed by consent of Parliament ? 

B. I have heard often that they ought to pay what was 
imposed by consent of Parliament to the use of the King, 
but to their own use never before I see by this, it is easier 
to gull the multitude, than any one man amongst them. 
For what one man, that has not his natural judgment de- 
praved by accident, could be so easily cozened in a matter 
that concerns his purse, had he not been passionately carried 
away by the rest to change of government, or rather to a 
liberty of every one to govern himself? 

A. Judge then, what kind of men such a multitude of

ignorant people were like to dect for tbeir buigenes and 
knights of shires. 

B» I can make no other judgment, but that thej who 
were then elected, were jost such as had been dected for 
former ParliamentSi and as h'kely to be elected for Parlia- 
ments to come. For people always have been, and always 
will be, ignorant of their duty to the public, as never medi- 
tating anything but their particular interest; in other things 
following their immediate leaders; which are either the 
preachers, or the most potent of the gentlemen that dwell 
amongst them : as common soldiers for the most part follow 
their immediate captains, if they like them. If you think 
the late miseries have made them wiser, that will quickly be 
forgot, and then we shall be no wiser than we were. 

A. AVhy may not men be taught their duty, that is, the \ 
science of just and unjust^ as divers other sciences have 
been taught, from true principles and evident demonstra* 
tion ; and much more esisily than any of those preachers 
and democratical gentlemen could teach rebellion and 
treason ? 

B, But who can teach what none have learned ? Or, if 
any man have been so singular, as to have studied the 
science of justice and equity ; how can he teach it safely, 
when it is against the interest of thosie that are in possession 
of the power to hurt him ? • 

A, The rules oijust and unjust sufficiently demonstrated, 
and from principles evident to the meanest capacity, have 
not been wanting; and notwithstanding the obscurity of 
their author, have shined, not only in this, but also in foreign 
countries, to men of good education. But they are few, in 
respect of the rest of the men, whereof many cannot read : 
many, though they can, have no leisure ; and of them that 
have leisure, the greatest part have their minds wholly 
employed and taken up by their private businesses or plea- 
sures. So that it is impossible that the multitude should 
ever learn their duty, but from the pulpit and upon holi- 
days ; but then, and from thence, it is, that they learned

tfadr disobedience. And» therefore, the light of that doc- 
trine has been hitherto covered and kept under here by a 
doud of adversaries, which no private man's reputation can 
keak through, without the authority of the Universities. 
But out of the Universities^ came all those preachers that 
taught the contrary. The Universities have been to this 
nation, as the wooden horse was to the Trojans.' 

B. What was the Pope's design in setting up the Uni- 
versities ?• 

A. What other design was he like' to have, but (what you 
heard before) the advancement of his own authority in 
the countries where the Universities were erected ? There 
they learned to dispute for him, and with unintelligible dis- 
tinctions to blind men's eyes, whilst they encroached upon 
the rights of kings. And it was an evident argument of that 
design, that they fell in hand with the work so quickly. 
For the first Rector of the University of Paris (as I have 
read somewhere) was Peter Lombard, who first brought in 
them the learning called School-divinity ; and was seconded 
by John Scot of Duns, who lived in, or near the same time ; 
whom any ingenious reader, not knowing it was the de- 

' B. Can you tell me why and when the Universities here, and in 
other places, first began ? 

A. It seems (for the time) they began in the reign of the Emperor 
Charles the Great. Before which time, I doubt not, but that there 
were many grammar schools for the Latin tongue, which wa« the 
natural language of the Roman Church ; but for Universities, that is 
to say, schools for the sciences in general, and especially for divinity, 
it is manifest that the institution of them was recommended by the 
Pope's letter to the Emperor Charles the Great, and recommended 
further by \ Council held in his time, I think, at Chalons-sur-Saone ; 
and not long after was erected an University at Paris, and the college 
called University College at Oxford. And so by degrees several 
bishops, noblemen, and rich men, and some Kings and Queens, con- 
tributing thereunto, the Universities obtained at last their present 
splendour.

pofde and oitangle men with word8» and to breed dis- 
putation» which must at last be ended in the determination 
of the Church of Rome. And yet in the doctrine of Aris- 
totle, they made use of many points ; as, first, the doctrine 
of Separated Essenees. 

£, What are Separated Esse nets f 

A. Sepamted beings. 

£. Sepamted from what? 

A. From every thing that is. 
. £. I cannot understand the being of any thing, which I 
understand not to be. But what can they make of that ? 

A. Very much, in questions concerning the nature of 
God, and concerning Uie estate of man's soul after death, 
in heaven, hell, and purgatory; by which you and every 
man know, how great obedience^ and how much money they 
gain from the common people. — Whereas Aristotle holdeth 
the soul of man to be the first gber of tnoHon to the body, 
and consequently to itself; they make use of that in the 
doctrine otfree wiU. What, and how they gain by that, I 
will not say. — He holdeth further, that there be many things 
that come to pass in this world from no necessity of causes, 
but mere contingency^ casuality^ zxA fortune. 

£. Methinks, in this they make God stand idle, and to 
be a mere spectator of the games of Fortune. For what God 
is the cause of, must needs come to pass, and (in my 
opinion) nothing else. But, because there must be some 
ground for the justice of the eternal torment of the damned; 
perhaps it is this, that men's wills and propensions are not 
(they think) in the hands of God, but of themselves ; and 
in this also I see somewhat conducing to the authority of 
the Church. 

A» This is not much ; nor was Aristotle of such credit 
with them, but that when his opinion was against theirs, 
they could slight him. Whatsoever he says is impossible in 
nature, they can pro^'e well enough to be possible, from the 
Almighty power of God, who can make many bodies to be 
in one and the self-same place, and one body to be in many

places at the same time^ if the doctrine of tnmsabstantiatidn 
* require it, though Aristotle deny it I like not the deagn 
of drawing religion into an art» whereas it ought to be a law; 
and though not the same in all countriesi yet in every 
' country indisputable; nor that they teach it not, as arts 
ought to be taughty by showing first the meaning of their 
terms, and then deriving from them the truth they would have 
us believe : nor that their terms are for the most part unin* 
telligible; though, to make it seem rather want of learning in 
the reader, than want of fiiir dealing in themselves, they are, 
for the most part, Latin and Greek words, wryed a little at 
the point, towards the native language of the several coun- 
tries where they are used. But that which is most intoler- 
able is, that all clerks are forced to make as if they believed 
them, if they mean to have any Church preferment, the keys 
whereof are in the Pope's hands ; and die common people, 
whatsoever they believe of those subtile doctrines, are never 
esteemed better sons of the Church for their leamin^^ 
There is but one way there to salvation ; that is, extraordinary 
devotion and liberality to the Church, and readiness for the 
Church's sake, if it be required, to fight against thdr natural 
*•( and lawful sovereigns. 

J?. I see what use they make of Aristotle's logic, physics, 
and metaphysics; but I see not yet how his politics can 
serve their turn. 

A. Nor L It has, I think, done them no good, though 
it has done us here much hurt by accident. For men, 
grown weary at last of the insolence of the priests, and 
examining the truth of those doctrines that were put upon 
them, began to search the sense of the Scriptures, as they 
are in the learned languages; and consequently (studying 
Greek and Latin) became acquainted with the democratical 
principles of Aristotle and Cicero, and from the love of their 
eloquence fell in love with their politics, and that more and 
more, till it grew into the rebellion we now talk of, without 
any other advantage to the Roman Church but that it was 
a weakening to us, whom, since we broke out of their net 



44 BEHEMOTH. ]bhhgH$\. 

b the time of Henry VIIL, they have continually en- 
deavoured to recover. 

B. What have they gotten by the teaching of Aristotle's 
ethics? 

A. It is some advantage to them, that neither the morals 
of Aristotle^ nor of any other, have done them any harm, 
nor us any good. Their doctrines have caused a great deal 
of dispute concerning virtue and vice, but no knowledge of 
what they are^ nor any method of attaining virtue nor of 
avoiding vice. — ^The end of moral philosophy is, to teach 
men of all sorts their duty, both to the public and to one 
another. They estimate virtue, partly by a mediocrity of 
the passions of men, and partly by that that they are 
praised. Whereas, it is not the Much or Little that makes 
an action virtuous, but the cause; nor Much or Little 
that makes an action vicious, but its being unconform- 
able to the laws in such men as are subject to the law, 
or its being unconformable to equity or charity in all men 
whatsoever. 

B. It seems you make a difference between the ethics of 
subjects and the ethics of sovereigns. 

A. So I da The virtue of a subject is com prehended (»' 
wholly in obedience to the laws of the commonwealth... JToI 
obey the laws, is justice and equity, which is the law of I 
nature, and, consequently, is civil law in all nations of. the ' 
world; and nothing is injustice or iniquity, otherwise, than 
it is against the law. Likewise, to obey the laws, is the 
prudence of a subject ; for without such obedience the 
commonwealth (which is every subject's safety and pro- 
tection) cannot subsist. And though it be prudence also in 
private men, justly and moderately to enrich themselves, yet 
craftily to withhold from the public or defraud it of such 
part of their wealth, as is by law required, is no sign of 
prudence, but of want of knowledge of what is necessary 
for their own defence. 

The_yirtues of sovereigns are such as ten^ tft thf y"a<»- 
tenance of peace at home, and tp the^rcsistanre of fnreiga.

enemies, Fortltiide « ^ «>yl TiTfinti tivrt though k be 
necessaiy in such private men m shall be soIdien» yet^ for 
other men, the less they dare^ the better it is both for the 
commonwealth and for themselves. Frugality (t hough 
perhaps you will think it strange) is also a royal virtue : for 
it increases the public stock, which cannot be too great for 
the public use, nor any man too sparing of what he has in 
trust for the good of others. ^liberality also is a royal 
virtue : for the commonwealth cannot be wetTserved with- 
out extraordinary diligence and service of ministers, and 
great fidelity to their Sovereign ; who ought therefore to be 
encouraged, and especially those that do him service in the 
wars. In sum^ all actions and habits are ,f 9.. be.,^^fffiped 
good or evil by their causes and usefulness in referen sR to 
"the"'cdmmonweaftH,'^hd* hoT^jT their "mediocrity, nor by 
their being commended. "^'TOiTSgiFeral ' men praiselieveral 
customs, and that which is virtue with one, is blamed by 
others; and, contrarily, what one calls vice^ another calls 
virtue, as their present affections lead them. 

B. Methinks you should have placed among the virtues 
that, which, in my opinion, is the greatest of all virtues, 
religion. 

^. So I have ; though, it seems, you did not observe it 
But whither do we digress from the way we were in ? 

B. I think you have not digressed at all ; for I suppose, 
your purpose was, to acquaint me with the history, not so 
I much of those actions that passed in the time of the late 
troubles, as of their causes, and of the councils and artifice 
by which they were brought to pass. There be divers men 
that have written the history, out of whom I might have 
learned what they did, and somewhat also of the contrivance; 
but I find little in them of what I would ask. Therefore, 
since you were pleased to enter into this discourse at my 
request, be pleased also to inform me afler my own method ; 
and for the danger of confusion that may arise from that, I 
will take care to bring you back to the place from whence I 
drew you ; for I well remember where it was.

A. Well then, to your question concerning religion, inas- 
much as I told you, that all virtue is comprehended in 
obedience to the laws of the commonwealth, whereof re- 
ligion is one^ I have placed religion amongst the virtues. 

B. Is religion then the law of a commonwealth ? 

A. There is no nation in the world, whose religion is not 
established, and receives not its authority from the laws of 
that nation. It is true, that the law of God receives no 
evidence from the laws of men. But because men can 
n evCT by their own wisdo m come to the knowl edge of wha t 
God hath spoken and commanded to be observed, nor be 
obliged to obey tfie laws whose author they Yiiow nog jhey 
are toacg^uiesce in some human authority or other. So 
that the question will be, whether a man ought in matter of 
religion, that is to say, when there is question of his duty to 
God and the King, to rely upon the preaching of his fellow- 
subjects or of a stranger, or upon the voice of the law ? 

B. There is no great difficulty m that point For there 
.ire none that preach here or anywhere else, or at least 
ought to preach, but such as have authority so to do from 
liim or them that have the sovereign power. So that if the 
King give us leave, you or I may as lawfully preach as 
any of them ; and I believe we should perform that office 
a great deal better, than they that preached us into the 
rebellioa 

A, The Church morals are in many points very different 
from these, that I have here set down, for die doctrine of 
virtue and vice ; and yet without any conformity with that 
of Aristotle. For in the Church of Rome, the pri ncipal 
virtues are, to obey their doctrine, thoughjt j>e tg^son, and 
^^'^t uTtdbclrdigiousr to' be^neficlai to the clergy, tfiat is 
their piety and liberality; and to believe upon their^word 
that which a man knows in his conscience to be false, which 
\& the faith they require.^'! could name a great many more 
such points of their morals, but that I know you know them 
already, being so well versed in the cases of conscience 
written by their schoolmen, who measure the goodness and

wickedness of all actions, by the'ir congmit^ with the doctrine 
of the Roman clergy. 

B. But what b the monl philosophy of the Protestant 
clergy in England^ 

A. So much as they show of it in their life Bnd con- 
versation, is for the most part very good, and of very good 
example ; much better than their writings. 

B. It happens many times that men live honestly for 
fear, who, if Ihey had power, would live according to their 
own o])inions ; that is, if their opinions be not right, un- 
rightecmsly. 

A. Do ihe clergy in England pretend, as the Pope does, 
or ai ilic Presbyterians do, to have a right from God ira- 
medinlcly, to govern the King and his subjects in all points 
of rcliuion and manners? If they do, you cannot doubt 
bill tlint if they had number and strength, which they are 
never like to have, they would attempt to obtain that power, 
a* llio oiliem have done.

A. According to whose interpretation was it received by 
the bishops and the rest of the loyal, party, but their own? 
He puts for another duty, obedience and submission to 
God's will. Did any of them, nay, did any man living, do 
any thing, at any time, against God's will ? 

JB. By God's will, I suppose, he means there his revealed 
will, that is to say, his commandments, which I am sure 
they did most horribly break, both by their preaching and 
otherwise. 

A. As for their own actions, there is no doubt but all men 
are guilty enough, if God deal severely with them, to be 
damned. And for their preaching, they will say, they 
thought it agreeable to God's revealed will in the Scriptures. 
If they thought it so, it was not disobedience, but error. 
And how can any man prove they thought otherwise? 

B. Hypocrisy hath "'indeed'*' this great prerogative above 
other sins, that it cannot be accused. 

A. Another duty he sets down is, to honour him in his 
!iouse (that is, the Church), in his possessions, in his day, 
in his word and sacraments. 

B. They perform this duty as well, I think, as any other 
ministers, I mean the loyal party; and the Presbyterians 
have always had an equal care to have God's house free 
from profanation; to have tithes duly paid, and offerings 
accepted; to have the sabbath day kept holy, the word 
preached, and the Lord's supper and baptism duly adminis- 
tered. But is not keeping of the feasts and fasts one of 
those duties that belong to the honour of God? If it be, 
the Presbyterians fail in that 

A. Why so? They kept some holidays, and they had 
fasts amongst themselves, though not upon the same days 
that the Church ordains, but when they thought fit; as 
when it pleased God to give the King any notable victory.

B. What is there in this, to give colour to the late rebel- 
lion? 

A, They will say they did it in obedience to God, inas- 
much as they did believe it was according to the Scripture ; 
out of which they will bring examples, perhaps of David and 
his adherents, that resisted King Saul, and of the prophets 
afterward, that vehemently from time to time preached 
against the idolatrous Kings of Israel and Judah. Saul was 
their lawful King, and yet they paid him neither active nor 
IfMABJve obedience; for they did put themselves into a 
pOAture of defence against him, though David himself spared 
hi4 person. And so did the Presbyterians put into their 
iotrnniA^ions to their general, that they should spare the 



so BEHEMOTH. < JXtthpau 

King*! penoo. Besides, y<m cannot doabt but that they, 
who in the pulpit did animate the people to take arms in 
the defence of the then Parliament, alleged Scripture, that 
is, the word of God, for it. If it be lawful then for subjects 
to resi^ the King,., when he commands anything that is 
against the Scripture, that is, contrary to the command of 
God, and to be judge of the meaning of the Scripture, it is 
impossible that the life of any King, or the peace of any 
Christian kingdom, can be long secure. It is this doctrine 
that divides a kingdom within itself, whatsoever the men be, 
loyal or rebels, that write or preach it publicly. And thus 
you see that if those seditious ministers be tried by this 
doctrine, they will come off well enough. 

B. I see it ; and wonder at people that have never spoken 
with God Almighty, nor knowing one more than another 
what he hath said, when the laws and the preacher disagree, 
should so keenly follow the minister (for the most part an 
ignorant, though a ready-tongued, scholar), rather than the 
laws, that were made by the King with the consent of the 
Peers and Commons of the land. 

A. Let us examine his words a little nearer. First, con- 
cerning passive obedience. When a. thief hath broken the 
laws, and according to the law is therefore executed, can any 
man understand that this suffering of his is in obedience to 
the law? Every law is a command to do^ or to forbear: 
neither of these is fulfilled by suffering. If any suffering can 
be called obedience, it must be such as is voluntary ; for no 
involuntary action can be counted a submission to the law. 
He that means that his suffering should be taken for 
obedience, must not only not resist, but also not fly, nor 
hide himself to avoid his punishment. And who is there 
amongst them that discourse of passive obedience^ when his 
life is in extreme danger, that will voluntarily present himself 
to the officers of justice ? Do not we see that all men, when 
they are led to execution, are both bound and guarded, and 
would break loose if they could, and get away ? Such is 
their passvi^e obedience, Christ saith (Matthew xxiii. 2, 3) : 



53 BEHEMOTH. DUaopai. 

to know, certainly , and in all casesi what God commands, or 
forbids us to do^ but by the sentence of him or them that 
are constituted by the King to determine the sense of the ; 
Scripture, upon hearing of the particular case of conscience^ 
which is in question. And they that are so constituted are 
easily known in all Christian commonwealths, whether they 
be bishops, or ministers, or assemblies, that govern the 
Church under him or them that have the sovereign power. 

B^ Some doubts may be raised from this that you now 
say. For if men be to learn their duty from the sentence 
which other men shall give concerning the meaning of the 
Scriptures, and not from their own interpretation, I under- 
stand not to what end they were translated into English, and 
every man not only permitted, but also exhorted, to read 
them. For what could that produce, but diversity of 
opinion, and consequently (as man's nature is) disputa- 
tion, breach of charity, disobedience, and at last rebel- 
lion? Again, since the Scripture was allowed to be read 
in English, why are not the translations such as might make 
all that is read, understood even by mean capacities ? Did 
not the Jews, such as could read, understand their law in 
the Jewish language, as well as we do our statute laws in 
English ? And as for such places of the Scripture, as had 
nothing of the nature of a law, it was nothing to the duty 
of the Jews, whether they were understood or not, seeing 
nothing is punishable but the transgression of some law. 
The same question I may ask concerning the New Testa- 
ment For, I believe, that those men to whom the original 
language was natural, did understand sufficiently what com- 
mands and councils were given them by our Saviour and 
his apostles, and his immediate disciples. Again, how 
will you answer that question which was put by St. Peter 
and St John (Acts iv. 19), when by Annas the high-priest, 
and others of the Council of Jerusalem, they were forbidden 
to teach any more in the name of Jesus : Whether is it right 
in the sight of God^ to hearken unto you more than unto Godf 

A. The case is not the same. Peter and John had seen 



56 BEHEMOTH. JHalogw \. 

had their breeding in the Univerrities. For such curious 
questions in divinity are first started in the Universities, and 
so are all those politic questions concerning the rights of 
civil and ecclesiastic government; and there they are 
furnished with arguments for liberty out of the works of 
Aristotle, Plato^ Cicero, Seneca, and out of the histories of 
Rome and Greece, for their disputation against the necessary 
power of their sovereigns. Therefore I despair of any last- 
ing peace amongst ourselves, till the Universities here 
shall bend and direct their studies to the settling of it, 
that is, to the teaching of absolute obedience to the laws of 
the King, and to his public edicts under the Great Seal of 
England. For I make no doubt, but that solid reason, 
backed with the authority of so many learned men, will 
more prevail for the keeping of us in peace within ourselves, 
than any victory can do over the rebels. But I am afraid 
that it is impossible to bring the Universities to such a 
compliance with the actions of state, as is necessary for the 
business. 

A, Seeing the Universities have heretofore from time to 
time maintained the authority of the Pope, contrary to all 
laws divine, civil, and natural, against the right of our Kings, 
why can they not as well, when they have all manner of laws 
and equity on their side, maintain the rights of him that is 
both sovereign of the kingdom, and head of the Church? 

B. Why then were they not in all points for the King's 
power, presently after that King Henry VIII. was in Parlia- 
ment declared head of the Church, as much as they were 
before for the authority of the Pope ? 

A. Because the clergy in the Universities, by whom all 
things there are governed, and the clergy without the 
Universities, as well bishops as inferior clerks, did think 
that the pulling down of the Pope was the setting up of 
them (as to England) in his place, and made no question,

hands from bishop to bishop ; notwidtstandtiig thejr knew 
I that this derivation passed through the hands of popes and 

bishops wliose authority they had cast off For thoagh they 
were content that the divine right, which the Pope pretended 
to in England, should be denied him, yet they thought it 
not so fit to be taken from the Church of England, whom 
they now supposed themselves to represent It seems they 
did not think it reasonable that a woman, or a child, or a * 
I man that could not construe the Hebrew, Greek, or Latin 

Bible, nor knew perhaps the declensions and conjugations 
of Greek or Latin nouns and verbs, should take upon him 
to govern so many learned doctors in matters of religion ; 
meaning matters of 'divinity: for religion has been for a 
long time, and is now by most people, taken for the same 
thing with divinity, to the great advantage of the clergy. 

B, And especially now amongst the Presbyterians. For 
I see few that are by them esteemed very good Christians, 
besides such as can repeat their sermons, and wrangle for 
them about the interpretation of the Scripture, and fight for 
them also with their bodies or purses, when they shall be 
required. To believe in Christ is nothing with them, unless 
you believe as they bid you. Charity is nothing with them, 
unless it be charity and liberality to them, and partaking 
with them in faction. How we can have peace while this 
is our religion, I cannot tell. Hard iateri lethalh arundo. 
The seditious doctrine of the Presbyterians has been stuck 
so hard into the people's heads and memories (I cannot say 
into their hearts ; for they understand nothing in it, but that 
they may lawfully rebel), that I fear the commonwealth will 
never be cured. 

A. The two great virtues, that were severally in Henry 

VII. and Henry VIII., when they shall be jointly in one 
King, will easily cure it That of Henry VII. was, without 
much noise of the people to fill his coffers ; that of Henry 

VIII. was an early severity ; but this without the former 
cannot be exercised. 

B, This that you say looks (methmks) like an advice to 



BEHEMOTH. DiaUftiu t. 

the King^ to let them alone till he have gotten ready money 
enough to levy and maintain a sufficient army, and then to 
fidl upon them and destroy them. 

- A^ God forbid that so horrible, unchristian, and inhuman 
a design should ever enter into the King's heart. I would 
have him to have money enough readily to raise an army to 
suppress any rebellion, and to take from his enemies all 
hope of success, that they may not dare to trouble him in 
the reformation of the Universities; but to put none to 
death without actual committing such crimes as are 
already made capital by the laws. jQie core of rebellion, 
as you have seen by this, and read of other rebellions, are 
the Univ ersities ; which nevertheless are not to be cast 
away, but to be better disciplined : that is to say, that the 
politics there taught be made to be (as true politics should 
be) such as are fit to make men know, that it is their duty 
to obey all Jaws wjmjsoever that shall by the authority of 
the King be enacted, till by the same authority they shall 
be repealed ; such as are fit to make men understand, that 
the civil laws are God*s laws, as they that make them, are 
by Crod appointed to make them ; and to make men know, 
that the people and the Church are one thing, and have but 
one head, the King ; and that no man has title to govern 
underlum, that has it not from him ; that theKing owes 
his_croiniJto_God^nly^ to no man, ecclesiastic or bther] 
and that_ the rdij;ion_they teach there, be a quiet waiting 
for the coming again of our blessed Saviour, and in the 
mean time a resolution to obey the King's laws (which also 
are God's laws) ; to injure no man, to be in charity with all 
men, to cherish the poor and sick, and to live soberly and 
free from scandal; without mingling our religion with points 
of natural philosophy, as freedom of will, incorporeal sub- 
stance, everlasting nows, ubiquities, hypostases, which the 
people understand not, nor will ever care for. When the 
Universities shall be thus disciplined, there will come out of 
them, from time to time, well-principled preachers, and they 
that are now ill-principled, from time to time fall away.

For if men know not their duty, what is there that can fcxoe

Were they not the janissaries, that not veiy long ago slew 
Osman in his own paJace at Constantinople ? 1 am there- 
fore of your opinion, both that men may be brou^t to a 
love of obedience by preachers and gentlemen that imbibe 
good principles in their youth at the Universities^ and also 
that we never shall have a lasting peace, till the Universities 
themselves be in such manner, as you have said, reformed ; 
and the ministers know they have no authority but what the 
supreme civil power gives them; and the nobility and gentry 
know that the liberty of a state is not an exemption from the 
laws of their own country, whether made by an assembly or 
by a monarch, but an exemption from the constraint and 
insolence of their neighbours. 

And now I am satisfied in this point, I will bring you 
back to the place from whence my curiosity drew you to 
this long digression. We were upon the point of ship- 
money ; one of those grievances which the Parliament ex- 
claimed against as tyranny and arbitrary government ; 
thereby to single out (as you called it) the King from hb 
subjects, and to make a party against him, when they 
should need it And now you may proceed, if it please 
you, to such other artifices as they used to the same 
purpose. 

A, I think it were better to give over here our discourse 
i of this business, and refer it to some other day that you shall

A. You are welcome; yet, if you had staid somewhat 
longer, my memory would have been so much the better 
provided for you. 

B. Nay, I pray you give me now what you have about 
you ; for the rest I am content you take what time you 
please^ 

A. After the Parliament had made the people believe 
that the exacting of ship-money was unlawful, and the 
people thereby inclined to think it tyrannical ; in the next 
place, to increase their disaffection to his Majesty, they 
accused him of a purpose to introduce and authorize the 
Roman religion in this kingdom : than which nothing was 
more hateful to the people ; not because it was erroneous 
(which they had neither learning nor judgment enough to 
examine), but because they had been used to hear it in- 
veighed against in the sermons and discourses of the 
preachers whom they trusted to. And this was indeed the 
most effectual calumny, to alienate the people's affections 
from him, that could be possibly invented. The colour 
they had for this slander was, first, that there was one 
Rosetti, Resident (at and a little before that time) from 
the Pope, with the Queen; and one Mr. George Con, 
Secretary to the Cardinal Francisco Barberini, nephew to 
Pope Urban VIII., sent over, under favour and protection 
of the Queen (as was conceived) to draw as many persons 
of quality about the court, as he should be able, to reconcile 
themselves to the Church of Rome : with what success I 
cannot tell ; but it is likely he gained some, especially of 
the weaker sex; if I may say, they. were gained by him, 
when not his arguments, but hope of favour from the Queen, 
in all probability prevailed upon them. 

B. In such a conjuncture as that was, it had perhaps 
been better they had not been sent.

greater number, and already in favour with the people, were 
generally hated. It was easy, therefore, for the Parliament 
to make that calumny pass currently with the people, when 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Laud, was for Arminius, 
and had a little before, by his power ecclesiastical, forbidden 
all ministers to preach to the people of predestination ; and 
when all ministers that were gracious with him, and hoped 
for any Church preferment, fell to preaching and writing 
for free-will, to the uttermost of their power, as a proof of 
their ability and merit Besides, they gave out, some of 
them, that the Archbishop was in heart a Papist ; and in 
case he could effect a toleration here of the Roman religion, 
was to have a cardinal's hat : which was not only false, but 
also without any ground at all for a suspicion. 

B, It is a strange thing, that scholars, obscure men, and 
such as could' receive no clarity but from the flame of the 
state, should be suffered to bring their unnecessary disputes, 
and together with them their quarrels, out of the universi- 
ties into the commonwealth ; and more strange, that the 
state should engage in their parties, and not rather put them 
both to silence. 

A, A state can constrain obedience, but convince no 
error, nor alter the minds of them that believe they have the 
better reason. Suppression of doctrine does but unite and 
exasperate, that is, increase both the malice and power of 
them that have already believed them. 

B. But what are the points they disagree in? Is there 
any controversy between Bishop and Presbyterian concern- 
ing the divinity or humanity of Christ ? Do either of them 
deny the Trinity, or any article of the creed ? Does either 
party preach openly, or write directly, against justice, charity, 
sobriety, or any other duty necessary to salvation, except 
only the duty *we owe* to the King ; and not that neither, 
but when they have a mind either to nile or destroy the 
King ? Lord have mercy upon us ! Can nobody be saved 
that understands not their disputations? Or is there more 

' obscure men that could. 



DM§g9ii 2. BEHEMOTH. 

requisite^ either of frith or honesty, for the ndvitioii of one 
man than of another? What needs so much preaching of 
faith to us that are no heathens, and that believe already all 
that Christ and his apostles have told us is necessary to 
salvation, and more too ? Why is there so little preaching 
of justice ? I have indeed heard righteousness often recom- 
mended to the people^ but I have seldom heard the word 
Justin occur in their sermons; nay, though in the Latin and 
Greek Bible the word justia occur exceeding often, yet in 
the English, though it be a word that every man understands, 
the word righteousness (which few understand to signify the 
same, but take it rather for rightness of opinion, than of 
action or intention), is put in the place of it 

A, I confess I know very few controversies amongst 
Christians, of points necessary to salvation. They are the 
questions of authority and power over the Church, or of 
profit, or of honour to Churchmen, that for the most part 
raise all the controversies. For what man is he, that will 
trouble himself and fall out with his neighbours for the 
saving of my soul, or the soul of any other than himself? 
When the Presbyterian ministers and others did so seriously 
preach sedition, and animate men to rebellion in these 
late wars ; who was there that had not a benefice, or having 
one feared not to lose it, or some other part of his main- 
tenance, by the alteration of the Government, that did 
voluntarily, without any eye to reward, preach so earnestly 
against sedition, as the other party preached for it ? I con- 
fess, that for aught I have observed in history, and other 
writings of the heathens, Greek and Latin, that those 
heathens were not at all behind us in point of virtue and 
moral duties, notwithstanding that we have had much 
preaching, and they none at alL I confess also, that con- 
sidering what harm may proceed from a liberty that men 
have, upon every Sunday and oftener, to harangue all the 
people of a nation at one time, whilst the state is ignorant 
of what they will say ; and that there is no such thing per- 
mitted in all the worid out of Christendom, nor therefore 



BEHEMOTH. Diai0pi4 2. 

any civil wan about religion; I have thought much preach- 
ing an inconvenience. Nevertheless, I cannot think tliat 
preaching to the people the points of their duty, both to 
God and man, can be too frequent ; so it be done by grave, 
discreet, and ancient men, that are reverenced by the people; 
and not by light quibbling young men, whom no congrega- 
tion is so simple as to look to be taught by (as being a thing 
contrary to nature), or to pay them any reverence, or to 
care what they say, except some few that may be delighted 
with their jingling. I wish with all my heart, there were 
enough of such discreet and audent men, as might suffice 
for all the parishes of England, and that they would under- 
take it But this is but a wish ; I leave it to the wisdom of 
the State to do what it pleaseth. 

£. What did they next ? 

A. Whereas the King had sent prisoners into places 
remote from London, three persons that had been con- 
demned for publishing seditious doctrine, some in writing, 
some in public sermons ; the Parliament (whether with his 
Majesty's consent or no, I have forgotten), caused tliem to 
be released and to return to London ; meaning (I think) 
to try how the people would be pleased therewith, and, by 
consequence, how their endeavours to draw the people's 
affections from the King had already prospered. When 
these three came through London, it was a kind of triumph, 
the people flocking together to behold them, and receiving 
them with such acclamations, and almost adoration, as if 
they had been let down from heaven; insomuch as the 
Parliament was now sufficiently assured of a great and 
tumultuous party, whensoever they should have occasion to 
use it On confidence whereof they proceeded to their 
next plot, which was to deprive the King of such ministers 
as by their wisdom, courage, and authority, they thought 
most able to prevent, or oppose their further designs against 
the King. — ^And first, the House of Commons resolved to 
impeach the Earl of Strafford, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 
of high-treason. 



DM^pa 2. BEHEMOTH. 

£. What was that Eaxl of Strafford befoie he had diat 
place ? And how had he offended the Fariiameiit or g^ven 
them cause to thuk he would be their enemy? For I have 
heard that in former Parliaments he had been as parlia- 
mentary as any other. 

A. His name was Sir Thomas Wentwoith, a gentleman 
both by birth and estate very considerable in hb own 
county, which was Yorkshire; but more considerable for his 
judgment in the public aflairs, not only of that counQr, but 
generally of the kingdom ; and was therefore often diosea 
for the Parliament, either as a Burgess for some borough, or 
else Knight of the shire. For his principles of politics, diey 
were the same that were generally proceeded upon by all 
men else that were thought fit to be chosen for the Parlia- 
ment ; which are commonly these : to take for the rule of 
justice and government the judgments and acts of formor 
Parliaments, which are commonly called precedents; to 
endeavour to keep the people from being subject to extra- 
parliamentary taxes of money, and from being with parlia- 
mentary taxes too much oppressed; to preserve to the 
people their liberty of body from the arbitrary power of the 
King out of Parliament ; to seek redress of grievances. 

£. What grievances ? 

A. The grievances were commonly such as these: the 
King's too much liberality to some favourite; the too much 
power of some minister or officer of the commonwealth ; 
the misdemeanour of judges, civil or spiritual; but especially 
all unparliamentary raising of money upon the subjects. 
And commonly of late, till such grievances be redressed, 
they refuse, or at least make great difficulty! to fumbh the 
King with money necessary for the most urgent occasions 
of the commonwealth. 

B, How then can a King discharge his duty as he ought 
to do, or the subject know which of his masters he is to 
obey? For here are manifestly two powers, which, when 
they chance to differ, cannot both be obeyed 

A, It is true ; but they have not often differed so much

to the danger of the commonwealth, as they have done in 
this Parliament, 1640. In all the Parliaments of the late 
King Charles before the year 1640, my Lord of Strafford 
did appear in opposition to the Ring's demands as much as 
any man ; and was for that cause very much esteemed and 
cried up by the people as a good patriot, and one that cour- 
ageously stood up in defence of their liberties ; and for the 
same cause was so much the more hated, when afterwards 
he endeavoured to maintain the royal and just authority of 
his Majesty. 

B, How came he to change his mind so much as it seems 
he did? 

A, After the dissolution of the Parliament holden in the 
year 1627 and x6a8, the King, finding no money to be 
gotten from Parliaments which he was not to buy with the 
blood of such servants and ministers as he loved best, 
abstained a long time from calling any more, and had 
abstained longer if the rebellion of the Scots had not forced 
him to it During that Parliament the King made Sir 
Thomas Wentworth a baron, recommended to him for his 
great ability, which was generally taken notice of by the 
disservice he had done the King in former Parliaments, 
but which might be useful for him in the times that came 
on : and not long after he made him of the Council, and 
after that again Lieutenant of Ireland, which place he dis- 
charged with great satisfaction and benefit to his Majesty, 
and continued in that ofRce, till, by the envy and violence 
of the Lords and Commons of that unlucky Parliament of 
1640, he died. In which year he was made general of the 
King's forces against the Scots that then entered into Eng- 
land, and the year before, Earl of Strafford The pacifica- 
tion being made, and the forces on both sides disbanded, 
and the Parliament at Westminster now sitting, it was not 
long before the House of Commons accused him to the 
House of Lords of High-Treasoa 

B. There was no great probability of his being a traitor 
to the King, from whose favour he had received his great-

safety. Whtt wtt the trettoo they Itid to Ut chlufg^ ? 

A, Many trtides were drtwn tip tgainst him, bat the 
sum of them was ooottmed in these two: first, thtt be htd 
traitoiY)iisly endetvoared to subvert the ftmdamenttl Itwt

introduce an aibitrary and tyrannical government against 
law : secondly, that he had laboured to subvert the rights 
of Parliaments, tnd the tndent course of Ftolitmenttry 
proceedings. 

B. Was this done by him without the knowledge of the 
King? 

A. No. 

B. Why then, if it were treason, did not the King him* 
self call him in question by his attorney ? What had the 
House of Commons to do, without his command, to accuse 
him to the Lords ? They might have complained to the King^ 
if he had not known it before. I understand not this law. 

A. Nor L 

B. Had this been by any former statutes made treason ? 

A. Not that I ever heaid of; nor do I understand how 
anything can be treason against the King, that the King^ 
hearing and knowing, does not think treason. But it was 
a piece of that Parliament's artifice, to put the word traitor' 
cusly to any article exhibited against any man whose life 
they meant to take away. 

B. Was there no particular instance of action or words, 
out of which they argued that endeavour of his to subvert the 
fundamental laws of Parliament, whereof they accused him ? 

A. Yes ; they said he gave the King counsel to reduce 
the Parliament to their duty by the Irish army, which not 
long before my Lord of Strafford himself had caused to be 
levied there for the King's service. But it was never proved 
against him, that he advised the King to use it against the 
Parliament. 

B, What are those laws that are called fundamental? 
For I understand not how one law can be more fundamental

than anotberi except only that law of nature that binds us 
aU to obey him, whosoever he be^ whom lawfiilly and for 
our own safety, we have promised to obey ; nor any other 
fimdamental law to a King, but solus populi^ the safety and 
well-being of his people. 

A. This Parliament, in the use of their words, when they 
accused any man, never regarded the signification of them, 
but the weight they had to aggravate their accusation to 
the ignorant multitude, which think all faults heinous that 
are expressed in heinous terms, if they hate the person 
accused, as they did this man, not only for being of the 
King's party, but also for deserting the Parliament's party as 
an apostate^ 

B* I pray you tell me also what they meant by arbitrary 
government, which they seemed so much to hate ? Is there 
any governor of a people in the world that is forced to 
govern them, or forced to make this and that law, whether 
he will or no ? I think not : or if any be, he that forces 
him does certainly make laws, and govern arbitrarily. 

A. That is true ; and the true meaning of the Parliament 
was, that not the King, but they themselves, should have 
the absolute government, not only of England, but of 
Ireland, and (as it appeared by the event) of Scotland also. 

B. How the King came by the government of Scotland 
and Ireland by descent from his ancestors, everybody can 
tell ; but if the King of England and his heirs should chance 
(which God forbid) to fail, I cannot imagine what title the 
Parliament of England can acquire thereby to either of those 
nations. 

A. Yes ; they will say they had been conquered anciently 
by the English subjects' money. 

B. Like enough, and suitable to the rest of their impu- 
dence. 

A. Impudence in democratical assemblies ' does almost 

' After *< demdcratical assemblies/* there follows in the MS, an illegible 
word and these further words : ** and generally in all assemblies,*' which 
have leen erased.

aU that's done; 'tis the goddess of rhetoric^ and carries 
proof with it. For what ordinary man will noli from so 
great boldness of affirmation, conclude there b great prober 
bility in the thing affirmed? Upon this accusation he was 
brought to his trial in Westminster Hall before the House 
of Lords, and found guilty, and presently after declared 
traitor by a bill of attainder, that is, by Act of Pluliament 

B. It is a strange thing that the Lords should be induced, 
upon 80 light grounds, to give a sentence, or give theur 
assent to a bill, so prejudicial to themselves and Adr 
posterity. 

A, It was not well done, and yet, as it seems, not. igno- 
rantly ; for there is a clause in the bill, that it should not 
be taken hereafter for an example, that b for a prejudice^ 
in the like case hereafter. 

B. That b worse than the bill itself and is a plain 
confession that their sentence was unjust For what harm 
is there in the examples of just sentences? Besides, if 
hereafter the like case should happen, the sentence b not 
at all made weaker by such a provbion. 

A. Indeed I believe that the Lords, most of them, 
^following the principles of warlike and savage natures, 
envied hb greatness, but yet* were not of themselves willing 
to condemn him of treason. They were awed to it by the 
clamour of common people that came to Westminster, 
crying out, ^^ Justice^ Justice against the Earl of Strafford!^ 
The which were caused to flock thither by some of the 
House of Commons, that were well assured, after the 
triumphant welcome of Prynne, Burton, and Bastwick, to 
put the people into tumult upon any occasion they desired. 
They were awed unto it partly also by the House of 
Commons itself, which if it desired to undp a Lord; had 
no more to do but to vote him a Delinquent. 

B. A delinquent ; what is that ? A sinner, b it not ? 
Did they mean to undo all sinners ? 

A, By delinquent they meant only a man to whom they 
would do all the hurt they could But the Lords did no 



TO BEHEMOTH* JUaUjpax 

' yet^ I think, suspect they meant to cashier their whole 
HonsCi 

B. It is a strange thing the whole House of Lords should 
not perceive that the ruin of the King's power, and the 
weakening of it, was the ruin or weakening of themselves. 
For they could not think it likely that the people ever 
meant to take the sovereignty from the ICing to give it to 
them, who were few in number, and less in power than so 
many Commoners, because less beloved by the people^ 

A. But it seems not so strange to me. For the Lords, 
for their personal abilities, as they were no less, so also they 
were no more skilful in the public affairs, than the knights 
and burgesses. For there is no reason to think, that if one 
that is to-day a knight of the shire in the lower House, be 
to-morrow made a Lord and a member of the higher House, 
he is therefore wiser than he was before. They are all, of 
both Houses, prudent and able men as any in the land, 
in the business of their private estates, which require nothing 
|but diligence and natural wit to govern them. But for the 
government of a commonwealth, neither wit, nor prudence, 
nor diligence, is enough, without infallible rules and the 
true science of equity and justice^ 

^ B, If this be true, it is impossible that any commonwealth 
in the world, whether monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy, 
should continue long without change, or sedition tending 
to change, either of the government or of the governors. 

A. It is true ; nor have any the greatest commonwealths 
in the world been long free from sedition. The Greeks had 
for awhile their petty kings, and then by sedition came to 
be petty commonwealths ; and then growing to be greater 
commonwealths, by sedition again became monarchies ; and 
all for want of rules of justice for the common people to 
take notice of; which if the people had known in the begin- 
nmgof every of these seditions, the ambitious persons could 
never have had the hope to disturb their government after 
. it had been once settled. For ambition can do little without 
hands, and few hands it would have, if the common people

were as diligently instructed in the tme principles of tfieir 
duty, as they are terri6ed and amazed by pfeadien» with 
fruitless and dangerous doctrines concerning the natore of 
man's will, and many other philosophical points that tend not 
at all to the salvation of their souls in the world tocome^nor 
to their ease in this life, but only to the direction towards the 
clergy of that duty which they ought to perform to the King^ 
B. For aught I see, all the states of Christendom wQl be 
subject to these fits of rebeUioui as long as the world lasteth. 

A. Like enough; and yet the iault (as I have said) may 
be easily mended, by mending the Universities. 

B. How long had the Parliament now sitten ? 

A. It began November the 3rd, x64a My Lord of Straf> 
ford was impeached of treason before the Lords, November 
the 1 2th, sent to the Tower November the sand, his trial 
began March the 22nd, and ended April the X3th. After 
his trial he was voted guilty of high-treason in the House 
of Commons, and after that in the Lords' House, May the 
6th ; and on the 12th of May beheaded. 

B. Great expedition; but could not the King, for all 
that, have saved him by a pardon? 

A. The King had heard all that passed at his trial, and 
had declared himself unsatisfied concerning the justice of 
their sentence. And, I think, notwithstanding the danger 
of his own person from the fury of the people, and that he 
was counselled to give way to his execution, not only by 
such as he most relied on, but also by the Earl of Strafford 
himself, he would have pardoned him, if that could have 
preserved him against the tumult raised and countenanced 
by the Parliament itself, for the terrifying of those they 
thought might favour him. And yet the King himself did 
not stick to confess afterwards, that he had done amiss, in 
that he did not rescue him. 

JB, It was an argument of good disposition in the King. 
But I never read that Augustus Caesar acknowledged that 
he had done a fault, in abandoning Cicero to the fury of 
his enemy Antonius : perhaps because Cioero, having been 



71 BEHEMOTH. L^gmiu 

of the ooQtiaiy fiictioii to his father^ had done Augustus no 
service at aU out of favour to him, but only out of enmity to 
Antoniusy and out of love to the senate^ that is indeed out 
of love to himself that swayed the senate; as it is very likely 
the Earl of Strafford came over to the Ring's party for his 
own ends, having been so much against the King in former 
Parliaments. 

A. We cannot safely judge of men*s intentions. But, I 
have observed often, that such as seek preferment, by their 
stubbornness have missed of their aim; and on the other 
side, that those princes that with preferment are forced to 
buy the obedience of their subjects, are already, or must be 
soon after, in a very weak condition. For in a market 
where honour and power is to be bought with stubbornness, 
there will be a great many as able to buy as my Lord 
Strafford was. 

B. You have read, that when Hercules fighting with the 
Hydra, had cut off any one of his many heads, there still 
arose two other heads in its place ; and yet at last he cut 
them off all 

A. The story is told false. For Hercules at first did not 
cut off those heads, but bought them off; and afterwards, 
when he saw it did him no good, then he cut them off, and 
got the victory. 

B. What did they next ? 

A. After the first impeachment of the Earl of Strafford, 
the House of Commons, upon December the i8th, accused 
the Archbishop of Canterbury also of high-treason, that is, 
of design to introduce arbitrary government, &c. ; for which 
be was, February the 28th, sent to the Tower; but his trial 
and execution were deferred a long time, till January the 
xoth, 1643, fof the entertainment of the Scots, that were 
come into England to aid the Parliament 

B. Why did the Scots think there was so much danger 
in the Archbishop of Canterbury? He was not a man of 
war, nor a man able to bring an army into the field ; but he 
was perhaps a very great politigian. 



DUd^gui s. BEHEMOTH. 

A. That did not qypear bj any remarkable eteat of Ms 
counsels. I never heard but he was a veiy honest man for 
his morals, and a veiy sealoos promoter of the Chtucb- 
govemment by bishops, and that desired to have the service 
of God performed, and the house of God adorned, as 
suitable as was possible to the honour we ought to do to 
the Divine Majesty. But to brings as he did, into the State 
his former controversies, I mean his squabblmgs in the 
University'about free-will, and his standing upon punctilios 
concerning the service-book and its rubrics, was not, in my 
opinion, an argument of his sufficiency in afiairs of State.— 
About the same time they passed an act (which the King 
consented to) for a triennial Parliament; wherein was enacted, 
that after this present Parliament there should be a Parlia* 
ment called by the King within the space of three years, 
and so from three years to three years, to meet at West- 
minster upon a certain day named in the act 

B. But what if the King did not call it, finding it perhaps 
inconvenient, or hurtful to the safety or peace of his people^ 
which God hath put into his charge ? For I do not well 
comprehend how any sovereign can well keep a people in 
order when his hands are tied, or when he hath any othor 
obligation upon him than the benefit of those he governs ; 
and at this time, for anything you have told me, they 
acknowledged the King for their sovereign. 

A. I know not; but such was the act. And it was 
further enacted, that if the King did it not by his own 
command, then the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Keeper 
for the time being, should send out the writs of summons; 
and if the Chancellor refused, then the Sheriffs of the several 
counties should of themselves, in their next county-courts 
before the day set down for the Parliament's meeting, 
proceed to the election of the members for the said Parlia- 
ment. 

B. But what if the sheriffs refused ? 

A, I think they were to be sworn to it : but for that, and 
other particulars, I refer you to the act 



74 BEHEMOTH. iDiakgui s. 

B. To wbom should they be swon, when there is no 
■Ftoliament? 

A. No doubt but to the King» whether there be a Parlia- 
ment sitting or na. 

B. Then the ICing may release them of their oath.* Be- 
sides, if the King, upon the refusal, should fall upon them 
in his anger; who shall (the Parliament not sitting) protect 
either the Qiancellor or the sheriffs in their disobedience ? 

A. I pray you do not ask me any reason of such things as 
I understand no better than you. I tell you only an act 
passed to that purpose, and was signed by the King in the 
middle of February, a little before the Archbishop was sent 
to the Tower. Besides this bill, the two Houses of Parlia- 
ment agreed upon another, wherein it was enacted, that the 
present Parliament should continue till both the Houses 
did consent to the dissolution of it ; which bill also the 
King signed the same day he signed the warrant for the 
execution of the Earl of Strafford. 

B. What a great progress made the Parliament 'towards 
. their ends, or at least'*' towards the ends of the most seditious 

Members of both Houses in so little time ! They sat down 
in November, and now it was May ; in this space of time, 
which is but half a year, they won from the King the 
adherence which was due to him from his people; they 
drove his faithfullest servants from him; beheaded the 
Earl of Strafford; imprisoned the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury ; obtained a triennial Parliament after their own disso- 
lution, and a continuance of their own sitting as long as 
they listed : which last amounted to a total extinction of the 
King's right, in case that such a grant were valid ; which I 
think it is not, unless the Sovereignty itself be in plain terms 
renounced, which it was not 

A. Besides, they obtained of the King the putting down 
the Star-chamber and High-Commission Courts.

invaded England in the Parliament's quanreL But this was 
a year or two after. 

JB. Before you go any furthery I desire to know the 
ground and original of that right, which either the House 
of Lords, or House of Commons, or both together, now 
pretend ta 

A. It is a question of things so long past, that they are 
now forgotten. Nor have we anything to conjecture by, 
but the records of our own nation, and some small and 
obscure fragments of Roman histories : and for the records, 
seeing they are of things done only, sometimes justly, some- 
times unjustly, you can never by them know what right they 
had, but only what right they pretended 
. E» Howsoever, let me know what light we have in thb 
matter from the Roman histories. 
, A. It would he too long, and an useless digression, to 
cite all the ancient authors that speak of the forms of those 
commonwealths, which were amongst our first ancestors 
the Saxons and other Germans, and of other nations, from 
whom we derive the titles of honour now in use in Eng- 
land ; nor will it be possible to derive from them any argu- 
ment of right, but only examples of fact, which, by the 
ambition of potent subjects, have been oftener unjust than 
otherwise^ And for those Saxons or Angles, that in ancient 
times by several invasions made themselves masters of this , 
nation, they were not in themselves one body of a common- 
wealth, but only a league of divers petty German lords and 
states, such as v^ the Grecian army in the Trojan war, 
without other obligation than that which proceeded from 
their own fear and w^kness. Nor were those lords, for 
the most part, the sovereigns at home in their own country, 
but chosen by the people for captains of the forces they 
brought with them. And therefore it was not without 
equity, when they had conquered any part of the land, and 
made some one of them king thereof, that the rest should 
have greater privileges than the common people and soldiers : 
amongst which privileges, a man may easily conjecture this

to be one; tlitt thef dKHiId be made aoqatiiited, tnd be of 

ooancQ, with him that hath the soreieigiitj in matter of 
govenmient, and have the greatest and most honomable 
offices both in peace and war. But becanse there can be 
. no government where there is more than one soveretgn* it 
cannot be inferred that they had a right to oppose the 
King's resolutions by forces nor to enjoy those honours and 
places longer than they should continue good subjects. 
And we find that the Kings of England did, upon every 
great occasion, call them together by the name of discreet 
and wise men of the kingdom, and hear their counsel, and 
make them judges of aU causes, that during their sitting 
were brought before them. But as he summoned them at 
his own pleasure, so had he also ever the power at his 
pleasure to dissolve them. The Normans also^ that des- 
cended from the Germans, as we did, had the same cus* 
toms in this particular ; and by this means, this privilege of 
the lords to be of the King's great council, and when they 
were assembled, to be the highest of the King's courts of 
justice, continued still after the Conquest to this day. But 
though there be amongst the lords divers names or titles of 
honour, yet they have their privilege only by the name of 
baron, a name received from the ahcient Gauls ; amongst 
whom, that name signified the King's man, or rather one of 

% his great men : by which it seems to me, that though they 

gave him counsel when he required it, yet they had no right 
to make war upon him if he did not follow it 

B. When began first the House of Commons to be part 
of the King's great council ? 

A. I do not doubt but that before the Conquest some 
discreet men, and known to be so by the King, were called 
by special writ to be of the same council, though they were 

i not lords ; but that is nothing to the House of Commons. 

The knights of shires and burgesses were never called to 
Parliament, for aught that I know, till the beginning of the 
reign of Edward I., or the latter end of the reign of Henry 
in., immediately after the misbehaviour of the barons; and.

ton ftdj^ vctf nuui knowi^ were ctUcd on purpose to wcftkeii 
that power of the lordsi which thqr had so freshly abused 
Before the time of Henry IIL, the lords were descended, 
most of them, from such as in the invasions and conquests 
of the Germans were peers and feUow-kinga, till one was 
made king of them aU; and their tenants were their sub- 
jects, as it is Ais day with the lords of Fiance. But after 
the time of Henry III., the kings hegjm to make lords in 
the place of them whose issue failed, titulary only, without 
the lands belonging to their title ; and by that means, their 
tenants being no longer bound to serve them in the wars, 
they grew every day less and less able to make a party 
against the King, though they continued still to be his great 
council And as their power decreased, so the power of 
the House of Commons increased ; but I do not find they 
were part of the Sling's council at all, nor judges over other 
men; though it cannot be denied, but a Eling may ask their 
advice, as well as the advice of any other. But I do not 
find that the end of their summoning was to give advice, 
but only, in case they had any petitions for redress of 
grievances, to be ready there with them whilst the King had his 
great council about him. But neither they nor the lords 
could present to the King, as a grievance, that the King 
took upon him to make the laws ; to choose his own privy- 
counsellors; to raise money and soldiers; to defend the 
peace and honour of the kingdom ; to make captains in his 
army, and governors of his casdes, whom he pleased For 
this had been to tell the King, that it was one of their 
grievances that he was King. 

B. What did the Parliament do, whilst the King was in 
Scotland? 

A. The King went in August; after which, the Parlia- 
ment, September the 8th, adjourned till the 20th of Octo- 
ber ; and the King returned in the beginning of December 
following. In which time the most seditious of both Houses,

to BEHEMOTH. DMogm^. 

A.' He cune back the 95th of November; and was 
welcomed with the acclamations of the common people, as 
much as if he had been the most beloved of all the Kings 
that were before him; but found not a reception by the 
Parliamenti answerable to it They presently began to pick 
new quarrels against him, out of everything he said to them. 
December the 2nd, the King called together both Houses 
of Parliament, and then did only recommend unto them the 
raising of succours for Ireland. 

B. What quarrel could they pick out of that ? 

A. None : but in order thereto, , as they may pretend,^ 
t hey had a bi ll in agitation to assert the power of levying 
and pressing sbldTefs tOSeftwo Houses of the Lords and / 
Com mons; wh ich waa as much as to take from the King S-^ 
the power of the militia^ which is in effect the whole sove- [ 
reign power. Fo r he th at Jiath the power of levying and I 
^fm^drng^thiTsoldiers, has all other rights of sovereignty J 
which he shall please to claim. The King, hearing of it, 
called the Houses of Parliament together again, on Decern- 

ber the 14th, and then pressed again the business of Ire- 
land (as there was need ; for all this while the Irish were 
murdering the English in Ireland, and strengthening them- 
selves against the forces they expected to come out of 
England): and withal, told them he took notice of the 
bill in agitation for pressing of soldiers, and that he was 
contented it should pass with a salvo jure both for him and 
them, because the present time was unseasonable to dispute 
it in. 

B. What was there unreasonable in this ? 

A. Nothing : what is unreasonable is one question, what 
they quarrelled at is another. They quarrelled at this : 
that his Majesty took notice of that bill, while it was in 
debate in the House of Lords, before it was presented to 
him in the course of Parliament ; and also that he showed 
himself displeased with those that propounded the said bill; 
both which they declared to be against the privileges of 
Parliament, and petitioned the King to give them repara- 



J)Mtgmi, . BEHEMOTH, 8i 

tbn against dioae by whose evS ocmiisd he WIS indnoed to 
it, that thejr might reoeiye condign punishment 
B. This was a crad pcoceeding^ Do not the Kingr of 

England use to sit in the Lords' House when thej please? 
And was not this bill in debate then in the House of Lords? 
It is a strange thing that a man should be hwAilly in the 
company of men, where he must needs hear and see what 
they say and do, and yet must not take notice of it so much 
as to the same company; for though the King was not 
at the debate itself, yet it was hwful for any of the Lords to 
make him acquainted with it. Any one of the House of 
Commons, though not present at a proposition or debate in 
the House, nevertheless hearing of it from some of his 
fellow-members, may certainly not only take notice of it, 
but also speak to it in the House of Commons : but to 
make the King give up his friends and counsellors to them, 
to be put to death, banishment, or imprisonment, for their 
good-will to him, was such a tyranny over a king, no king 
ever exercised over any subject but in cases of treason or 
murder, and seldom then. 

A. Presently hereupon began a kind of war between the . 
pens of the Parliament and those of the secretaries, and 
other able men that were with the King. For upon the 
15th of December they sent to the King a paper called A 
Eenumstrance of the State of the Kingdom^ and with it a 
petition ; both which they caused to be published. In 
the remomstrance they complained of certain mischievous 
designs of a malignant party, then, before the beginning of 
the Parliament, grown ripe ; and did set forth what means 
had been used for the preventing of it by the wisdom of 
the Parliament; what rubs they had found therein; what 
course was fit to be taken for restoring and establishing 
the ancient honour, greatness, and safety, of the Crown and 
nation. 

And of these designs the promoters and actors were (they 
said) I. Jesuited Papists : 

2. The bishops, and that part of the clerg)* that cherish 



8a BEHEMOTH. DMogmi. 

m 

foniialit7 ts a support of their own ecclesiastical tyranny 
and usurpation : 

3. CounseUon and courtiers, that for private ends (they 
said) had engaged themselves to further the interests of 
some foreign princes. 

B. It may very well be» that some of the bishops, and 
also some of the court, may have, in pursuit of their private 
interest, done something indiscreetly, and perhaps wickedly. 
Therefore I pray you tell me in particular what their crimes 
were : for methinks the King should not have connived at 
anything against his own supreme authority. 

A. The Parliament were not very keen against those that 
were for the King,' they made no doubt but all they did 
was by the King's command; but accused thereof the 
bishops, counsellors, and courtiers, as being a more man- 
nerly way of accusing the King himself, and defaming him 
to his subjects. For the truth is, the charge they brought 
against them was so general as not to be called an accusa- , 
tion, but railing. As first (they said) they nourished ques- 
tions of prerogative and liberty between the King and his 
people, to the end that, seeming much addicted to his 
Majesty's service, they might get themselves into places of 
greatest trust and power in the kingdom. 

B. How could this be called an accusation, in which 
there is no fact, for any accusers to apply their proofs to, or 
their witnesses. For granting that these questions of pre- 
rogative had been moved by them, who can prove that their 
end was to gain to themselves and friends the places of trust 
and power in the kingdom ? 

A. A second accusation was, that they endeavoured to 
suppress the purity and power of religion. ^ 

B, That is canting. Tis not in man's power to suppress ^ 
the power of religion. 

A. They meant that they would suppress the doctrine of 
the Presbyterians ; that is to say, the very foundation of the 
then Parliament's treacherous pretensions. 

*^een against them that were against the King edd, which has been

A third, that thejr cherished Armiiiiiii^ P^q)iit% tad 
h'bertines (Iqr which thejr meant the commoii Protestant^ 
which meddle not with dispatesX to the end thej mq^ 
compose a body fit to act accordmg to thdr coonsels luA 
resolutions. 

A fourth, that they endeavoured to put the King upon 
other courses of raising money, than by the ordtnaiy way of 
Parliaments. 

Judge whether these may be property called accusational 
or not rather spiteful reproaches of the King's government 

B. Methinks this Ust was a very great &ult For what 
good could there be in putting the King upon any odd 
course of getting money, when the Parliament was willing 
to supply him, as far as to the security of the kingdom, or 
to the honour of the King, should be necessary ? 

A. But I told you before, they would give him none, but 
with a condition he should cut off the heads of whom they 
pleased, how faithfully soever they had served him. And 
if he would have sacrificed all his friends to their ambition, 
yet they would have found other excuses for denying him 
subsidies; for they were resolved to take fromjhim the 
sovereign power to themselves ; which they could nerar do 
without taking great care that he should have no money at 
all. In the next place, they put into the remonstrance, as 
faults of them whose counsel the King followed, all those 
things which since the beginning of the King's reign wero 
by them misliked, whether faults or not, and whereof they 
were not able to judge for want of knowledge of the causes 
and motives that induced the King to do them, and were 
known only to the King himself, and such of his privy- 
council as he revealed them to. 

B. But what were those particular pretended faults? 

A. I. The dissolution of his first Parliament at Oxford* 
2. The dissolution of his second Parliament, being in the 
second year of his reign. 3. The dissolution of his Parlia- 
ment in the fourth year of his reign. 4. The fruitless 
expedition against Calais. 5. The peace made with Spain, 



BEHEMOTH. JHalogm^. 

whereby the Palatine's cause was deserted* and left to 
chargeable and hopeless treaties. 6. The sending of com- 
missions to raise money by way of loan. 7. Raising of 
ship-money. 8. Enlargement of forests, contrary to Magna 
Charta. 9. The design of engrossing all the gunpowder 
into one hand, and keeping it in the Tower of London, xo. 
A design to bring in the use of brass money, xx. The 
fines, imprisonments, stigmatizings, mutilations, whippings, 
pillories, gags, confinements, and banishments, by sentence 
in the Court of Star-Chamber. xi. The displacing of 
judges. X3. Illegal acts of the Council-table. 14. The 
arbitrary and illegal power of the Earl Marshal's Court 
X5. The abuses in Chancery, Exchequer-chamber, and 
Court of Wards. 16. The selling of titles of honour, of 
judges, and Serjeants' places, and other offices. 17. The 
insolence of bishops and other clerks, in suspensions, ex- 
communications, deprivations, and degradations of divers 
painful, learned and pious ministers. 

B. Was there any such ministers degraded, deprived, or 
excommunicated ? 

A. I cannot tell. But I remember I have heard threat- 
ened divers painful, unlearned and seditious ministers. 

18. The excess of severity of the High Commission- 
Court X9. The preaching before the King against the 
property of the subject, and for the prerogative of the 
King above the law. And divers other petty quarrels they 
had to the government ; which though they were laid upon 
this faction, yet they knew they would fall upon the King 
himself in the judgment of the people, to whom, by printing, 
they were communicated. 

Again, after the dissolution of the Parliament May the 
5th, 1640, they find other faults : as the dissolution itself, 
the imprisoning some members of both Houses, a forced 
loan of money attempted in London, the continuance of 
the Convocation, when the Parliament was ended ; and the 
favour showed to Papists by Secretary Windebank and others. 

B, All this will go current with common people for mis- 



t« BEHEMOTH. ZHahguit. 

A. Thqr reckoned, also^ patting down of the High-Com- 
mission, and the abating of the power of the Council-table» 
and of the bishops and their courts ; the taking away of 
unnecessary ceremonies in religion ; removing of ministers 
from their livings, that were not of their faction, and putting 
in *their places* such as were. 

B. All this was but their own, and not the kingdom's 
business. 

A. The good they had done the King, was first (they 
said) the giving of 25,000/. a month for the relief of the 
northern counties. 

Bi What need of relief had the northern, more than the 
rest of the counties of England ? 

A. Yes, in the northern counties were quartered the 
Scotch army which the Parliament called in to oppose the 
King,* and consequently their quarter was to be discharged. 

B. True ; but by the Parliament that called them in. 

A. But they say no; and that this money was given to 
the King, because he was bound to protect his subjects. 

B. He is no further bound to that, than they give him 
money wherewithal to do it This is very great impudence; 
to raise an army against the King, and with that army 
to oppress their fellow-subjects, and then require that the 
King should relieve them, that is to say, be at the 
charge of paying the army that was raised to fight against 
him. 

A. Nay, further; they put to the King's account the 
300,000/. given to the Scots, without which they would not 
have invaded England ; besides many other things, that I 
now remember not 

B. I did not think there had been so great impudence 
and villainy in mankind. 

A. You have not observed the world long enough to see all 
that's ill. Such was their remonstrance, as I have told 
you. With it they sent a petition, containing three pomts : 
I. That his Majesty would deprive the bishops of their 
votes in Parliament, and remove such oppressions in

reUgioiiy chmdi-gOTenimeiit, and AtdpSii^ ts tfiey had 
brought in; a. That he would remove from his cooodl all 
such as should promote the people's grievanoesi and em- 
I ploy in his great and public afiabsi such ^persons* as the 

Parliament should con6de in ; 3. That he would not give 
away the lands escheated to the Crown by the rd>eIlioa in 
Irekmd. 

B. This Ust pointy methinksi was not wisely put m at 
this time : it should have been reserved till they had sub- 
dued the rebels, against whom there were yet no forces sent 
over. Tis like selling the lion's skin before they had killed 
him. But what answer was made to the other two pro- 
positions? 
A. What answer should be made, but a denial? About 
[i the same time the King himself exhiUted articles against 

six persons of the Parliamenti five whereof were of the House 
of Commons and one of the House of Lords» accusing them 
of high-treason ; and upon the 4th of January, went himself 
to the House of Commons to demand those five of thenu 
But private notice having been given by some treacherous 
person about the King, they had absented themselves ; and 
by that means frustrated his Majesty's intentioiL And after 
I he was gone, the House making a heinous matter of it, and 

I a high breach of their privileges, adjourned themselves into 

London, there to sit as a general committee, pretendmg 
they were not safe at Westminster : for the King, when he 
went to the House to demand those persons, had somewhat 
more attendance with him (but not otherwise armed than 
his servants used to be) than he ordinarily had. And would 
not be pacified, though the King did afterwarcs waive the 
prosecution of those persons, unless he would also discover 
to them those that gave him counsel to go in that manner 
to the Parliament House, to the end they might receive 
condign punishment; which was the word they used instead ^ 
of cruelty. 

; B. This was a harsh demand Was it not enough that 
the King should forbear his enemies, but that he must also

betray his friends ? If they thus tyrannise over the King j 
before they have gotten the sovereign power into their ' 
handsi how will they tyranoiase over their fellow-subjects j 
idien they have gotten it ? 

i4. So as they did. 

B. How long stayed that committee in London ? 

A. Not above two or three days ; and then were brought 
from London to the Parliament House by water in great 
triumph, guarded with a tumultuous number of armed men, 
there to sit in security in despite of the King, and make 
traitorous acts against him, such and as many as they listed; 
and under favour of these tumults, to frighten away from 
the House of Peers all such as were not of their faction. 
For at this time the rabble '''of people'*' were so insolent, that 
scarce any of the bishops durst go to the House for fear 
of violence upon their persons ; in so much as twelve of 
them excused themselves of coming thither, and by way of 
petition to the King, remonstrated that they were not per- 
mitted to go quietly to the performance of that duty, and 
protesting against all determinations, as of none effect, that 
should pass in the House of Lords during their forced absence. 
Which the House of Commons taking hold of, sent to the 
Peers one of their members, to accuse them of high-treason. 
Whereupon ten of them were sent to the Tower ; after which 
time there were no more words of their high-treason ; but 
there passed a bill, by which they were deprived of their 
votes in Parliament ; and to this bill they got the King's 
assent And, in the beginning of September after, they 
voted that the bishops should have no more to do in the 
government of the Church ; but to this they had not the 
King's assent, the war being now begun. 

B. What made the Parliament so averse to episcopacy ; 
and especially the House of Lords, whereof the bishops 
were members ? For I see no reason why they should do 
it to gratify a number of poor parish priests that were Pres- 
byterians, and that were never likely any way to serve 
the Lords; but, on the contrary, to do their best to pull

B. It 11 a hard quk^ that there should be two fiu^tions to 
trouble the commonwealth^ without any mterest in it of 
their qwiii other than every particular man may have ; and 
that their quarrel should be only about opinions, that is, 
about who has the most learning ; as if their learning ought 
to be the rule of governing all the world What is it they 
are learned in ? Is it politics and rules of state ? I know, 
it is called divinity ; but I hear almost nothing preached 
but matter of philosophy. For religion in itself admits no 
controversy. It is a law of the kingdom, and ought not to 
be disputed. I do not think they pretend to speak with 
God and know his will by any other way than reading the 
Scriptures, which we also da 

A. Yes, some of them do, and give themselves out for 
prophets by extraordinary inspiration. But the rest pretend 
only (for their advancement to benefices and charge of 
souls) a greater skill in the Scriptures than other men have, 
by reason of their breeding in the Universities, and know- 
ledge there gotten of the Latin tongue, and some also of 
the Greek and Hebrew tongues, wherein the Scripture was 
written; besides their knowledge of natural philosophy, 
which is there publicly taught. 

B, As for the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, it was 
once (to the detection of Roman fraud, and to the ejection 
of the Romish power) very profitable, or rather necessary ; 
but now that is done, and we have the Scripture in English, 
and preaching in English, I see no great need of Greek, 
Latin, and Hebrew. I should think myself better qualified 
by understanding well the languages of our neighbours, 
French, Dutch, and Spanish. — I think it was never seen in 
the world, before the power of popes was set up, that philo- 
sophy was much conducing to power in a commonwealth. 

B. But philosophy, together with divinity, have very 

much conduced to the advancement of the professors thereof 

* to places of greatest authority, next to the authority of kings 

themselves, in most of the ancient kingdoms of the world ; 

as is manifestly to be seen in the history of those times.

thus: ^^From out of the most eminent cities^ Hieropolis^ 
ThebeSy and Metnphis^ they choose judges^ which are a council 
not inferior to that of Areopagus in Athe^ts, or that of the

then did the chief justice put this jewel of truth to omofthe 
pleas.** You see now what power was acquired in civil 
matters by the conjuncture of philosophy and divinity.' 

Let us come now to the commonwealth of the Jews. Was 
not the priesthood in a family (namely, the Levites) as well 
as the priesthood of Egypt? Did not the high-priest give 
judgment by the breastplate of Urim and Thummim? 
Look upon the kingdom of Assyria, and the philosophers 
called Chaldeans. Had they not lands and cities belonging

make away themselves? The King killed them, for the 
safety of his person ; they him, out of ambition, or love of 
change. The King's act may be coloured with the good of

ever doctrine looked with an ill aspect upon their interest ; 
and consequently all true philosophy, especially civil and 
moral, which can never appear propitious to ambition, or to 
an exemption from their obedience due to the sovereign 
power. '*'[That reputation they have in the sciences, hath not 
proceeded from anything they have effected by those sciences, 
but from the infirmity of the people that understand nothing 
in them, and admire nothing but what they.understand not. 
There was lately erected a company of gentlemen for the 
promoting of natural philosophy and mathematics. What 
they will produce, I know not yet, but this I am sure of, that 
the authority of licensing the books that are to be written of 
that subject, is not in them, but in some divines, who have 
little knowledge in physics, and none at all in mathematics.]'^ 

After the King had accused the Lord Kimbolton, a mem- 
ber of the Lords' house; and Hollis, Haslerigg, Hampden, 
Pym, and Stroud, five members of the Lower House, of 
high-treason : and after the Parliament had voted out the 
bishops from the House of Peers ; they pursued especially 
wo things in their petitions to his Majesty : the one was, 
that the King would declare who were the persons that 
advised him to go, as he did, to the Parliament-house to 
apprehend them, and that he would leave them to the Par- 
liament to receive condign punishment. And this they did, 
to stick upon his Majesty the dishonour of deserting his 
friends, and betraying them to his enemies. The other was, 
that he would allow them a guard out of the city of London, 
to be commanded by the Earl of Essex ; for which they 
pretended, they could not else sit in safety ; which pretence 
was nothing but an upbraiding of his Majesty for coming to 
Parliament better accompanied than ordinary, to seize the 
five seditious members. 

B, I see no reason '^why'^' in petitioning for a guard,. they 
should determine it to the city of London in pariicular, and 
the command by name to the Earl of Essex, unless they 
meant the King should understand it for a guard against 
himself. 



BEHEMOTH. Diahgui %. 

his Majesty would be pleased to put forthwith, first, th< 
Tower of London, secondly, all other forts, thirdly, the whoU 
miliiia of the kingdom, into the hands of such persons as^ 
should be recommended to him by both the Houses 
Parliament And thb they style a necessary petition. 

B. Were there really any such fears and dangers generally 
conceived here, or did there appear any enemies at that 
time with such designs as are mentioned in the petition? 

A. Yes. But no other fear of danger, than such as any 
discreet and honest man might justly have of the designs of 
the Parliament itself, who were the greatest enemies to the 
peace of the kingdom that could possibly be. It is also 
worth observing, that this petition began with these words, 
"Most gracious Sovereign*' : so stupid they were as not to 
know^ that he that is master of the militia^ is master of the 
kingdom, and consequently is in possession of a most abso- 
lute sovereignty. The King was now at Windsor, to avoid 
the tumults of the common people before the gates of 
Whitehall, together with their clamours and afifronts there. 
The 9th of February after, he came to Hampton Court, 
and thence he went to Dover with the Queen, and the 
Princess of Orange, his daughter; where the Queen with 
the Princess of Orange embarked for Holland, but the King 
returned to Greenwich, whence he sent for the Prince of 
Wales and the Duke of York, and so went with them to- 
wards York. 

B> Did the Lords join with the Commons in this petition 
for the miiiHa f 

A. It appears so by the title; but I believe they durst 
not but do it The House of Commons took them but for 
a cypher ; men of title only, without real power. Perhaps 
also the most of them thought, that the taking of the militia 
from the King would be an addition to their own power ; 
but they were very much mistaken, for the House of Com- 
mons never intended them slmrers in it 

B. What answer made the King to this petition ? 

A. ** That when he shall know the extent of pouter which is

before unto his Majesty the nanus of the persons whom they 
approve or recommend^ unless such persons shaU be named^ 
against whom he shall have just and unquestionable exuptions!* 
B. What power, for what time, and to whom, did the 
Parliament require,' concerning the militia f 

A. The same power which the King had placed before* in 
his lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants, in the several coun* 
ties, and without other limitation of time but their own 
pleasure. 

B, Who were the men that should have this power?) 

A, There is a catalogue of them printed They are very 
many, and most of them lords ; nor b it necessary to have 
them named ; for to name them is (in my opinion) to brand 
them with the mark of disloyalty or of folly. When they 
had made a catalogue of them, they sent it to the King, 
with a new petition for the militia. Also presently after, 
they sent a message to his Majesty, praying him to leave 
the Prince at Hampton Court; but the King granted 
neither. 

B. Howsoever, it was wisely done« of them to get host* 
ages (if they could) of the King, before he went from 
them. 

A. In the meantime> to raise money for the reducing of 
Ireland, the Parliament invited men to bring in money by 
way of adventure, according to these propositions, i. That 
two millions and five hundred thousand acres of land in

All according to English measure, and consisting of meadow» 
arable^ and profitable pasture ; bogs, woods, and barren 
mountains being cast in over and above. 2. A revenue 
was reserved to the Crown, from one penny to three-pence 
on every acre. 3. That commissions should be sent by 
the Parliament, to erect manors, settle wastes and com- 
mons, maintain preaching ministers, to create con>orations, 
and to regulate plantations. The rest of the propositions 
concern only the times and manner of payment of the sums 
subscribed by the adventurers. And to these propositions I 
his Majesty assented ; but to the petition of the militia^ his 
Majesty denied his assent 

B. If he had not, I should have thought it a great won- 
der. What did the Parliament after this ? 

A. They sent him another petition, which was pre- 
sented to him when he was at Theobald's, in his way to 
York ; wherein they tell him plainly, thai unless hi be pleased 
to assure them by those messengers then sent^ that he would 
^eedily apply his royal assent to the satisfaction of tJuir former 
desires^ they shall be enforced^ for the safety of his Majesty and 
his kingdoms^ to dispose of the mititia by the authority of both 
Houses^ &'c. They petition his Majesty also to let the 
Prince stay at St. James's, or some other of his Majesty's < 
houses near London. They tell him also, that the power of 
nosing, ordering, and disposing of the militia^ cannot be 
granted to any corporation, without the authority and con- 
sent of the Parliament ; and that those parts of the king- 
dom, which have put themselves into a posture of defence, 
have done nothing therein but by direction of both Houses, 
and what is justifiable by the laws of this kingdom. 

B. What answer made the King to this ?

litment^ which it the supreme court of judicature in the 
kingdom, shall declare what the law of the land is,'to have 
this not only questioned, but contradicted, is a high breach 
of the privilege of Parliament 

B. I thought that he that makes the law, ought to declare 
what the law is. For what is it else to make a law, but 
to declare what it is ? So that they have taken from the 
King, not only the militia^ but also the legislative power. 

A. They have so; but I make account that the legislative 
pow er (an d indeed all power possible) is contained in the 
V^U^.^}^^^^* ~A!ler this, they seize such money as 
was due to his Majesty upon the bill of tonnage and pound- 
age^ and upon the bill of subsidies, that they might disable 
him every way they possibly could. They sent htm also 
many other contumelious messages and petitions after his 
coming to York ; amongst which one was : '' That whereas 
the Lord Admiral, by indisposition of body, could not 
command the fleet in person, he would be pleased to give 
authority to the Earl of Warwick to supply his place; '' when 
they knew the King had put Sir John Pennington into '^'that 
employment"* before.' 

B. To what end did the King entertain so many petitions, 
messages, declarations and remonstrances, and vouchsafe 
his answers to them, when he could not choose but clearly 
see they were resolved to take from him his royal power, 
and consequently his life? For it could not stand with 
their safety to let either him or his issue live, after they had 
done him so great injuries. 

A. Besides this, the Parliament had at the same time a 
committee residing in York ^both'*' to spy what his Majesty 
did, and to inform the Parliament thereof, and also to hinder 
the King from gaining the people of that county to his 
party : so that when his Majesty was courting the gentlemen 
there, the committee was instigating of the yeomanry against 
him. To which also the ministers did very much contribute ; 
so that the King lost his opportunity at York.

B. Why did not the King teiae the committee into hii 
hands, or drive them oot of the town? 

A. I know not; but I believe he knew the Ftoliament 
had a greater party than he^ not only in Yorkshire but also 
in York. Towards the end of April, the King, upon petition 
of the people of Yorkshire to have the magazine of Hull to 
remain still there^ for the greater security of the northern 
parts, thought fit to take it into his own hands. He had a 
little before appointed governor of that town the Earl of 
Newcastle; but the townsmen, having been already cov» 
nipted by the Parliament, refused to receive him, but refused 
not to receive Sir John Hotham, appointed to be governor 
^there'*' by the Parliament The King therefore coming before 
the town, guarded only by his own servants, and a few 
gentlemen of the country thereabouts, was denied entrance 
by Sir John Hotham, that stood upon the wall ; for which 
act he presently caused Sir John Hotham to be proclaimed 
traitor, and sent a message to the Parliament, requiring 
justice to be done upon the said Hotham, and that the town 
and magazine might be delivered into his hands. To 
which the Parliament made no answer, but instead thereof 
published another declaration, in which they omitted nothing 
of their former slanders against his Majesty's government, 
but inserted certain propositions declarative of their own 
pretended right : viz. i. That whatsoever they declare to 
be law, ought not to be questioned by the King : 2. That 
no precedents can be limits to bound their proceedings: 
3. That a Parliament, for the public good, may dispose of 
anything wherein the King or subject hath a right; and 
that they, without the King, are this Parliament, and the 
judge of this public good, and that the King's consent is 
not necessary : 4. That no member of either House ought 
to be troubled for treason, felony, or any other crime, unless 
the cause be first brought before the Parliament, that they 
may judge of the fact and give leave to proceed, if they see 
cause : 5. That the sovereign power resides in both Housesi 
and that the King ought to have no negative voice:.

& Thtt the lefjing of forces agaiiist the personal commands 
of the King (though accompanied with his presence) is not 
tefjing war against the King, but the levying of war against '^'his 
politic person,* viz., his laws, &c., though not '^'accompanied 
with* his person, is levying war against the King : 7. That 
treason cannot be committed against his person, otherwise 
than as he b entrusted with the kingdom and discharges 
that trust ; and that they have a power to judge whether he 
*have* discharged this trust or not : 8. That they may dispose 
of the King when they will 

B. This is plain dealing and without hypocrisy. Could 
the city of London swallow this ? 

A* Yes ; and more too, if need be. London, you know, 
has a great belly, but no palate nor taste of right and wrong. 
In the Parliament-roll of Henry IV., amongst the articles of 
the oath the King at his coronation took, there is one runs 
thus: Concedes jusias leges et consueludines esse tenendas ; ei 
framitHs per te eas esse protegendas^ et adhonorem Dei corr<h 
borandas^ guas vulgus elegerit Which the Parliament urged 
for their legislative authority, and therefore interpret guas 
vulgus elegerit^ which the people shall choose; as if the King 
should swear to protect and corroborate laws before they 
were made, whether they be good or bad; whereas the 
word signifies no more, but that he shall protect and 
corroborate such laws as they have chosen, that is to say, 
the Acts of Parliament then in being. And in the records 
of the Exchequer it is thus : " Will you grant to hold and 
keep the laws and rightful customs which the commonalty of 
this your kingdom have^ and will you defend and uphold them ? 
^c,** And this was the answer his Majesty made to that 
point. 

B» And I think this answer very full and clear. But if 
the words were to be interpreted in the other sense, yet I 
see no reason why the King should be bound to swear to 
them. For Henry IV. came to the Crown by the votes of a 
Parliament not much inferior in wickedness to this Long 
Parliament, that deposed and murdered their lawful King ; 



DiaUgiut. BEHEMOTH. 10$ 

saving that it was not the PifUament itad^ but the vtuiper 
that murdered King Richard IL 

A. About a week after, in the bepnning of Ifajr, the Yvf 
liament sent the King another paper, which they styled the 
humble petition and advice of both Houses, containing 
nineteen propositions ; which, when you shall hear, you will 
be able to judge what power they meant to leave to the King^ 
more than to any one of his subjects. The first of them is 
this: 

1. That the Lords and others of his Majesty's privy* 
council, and all great officers '^'and ministers* of states both at 
home and abroad, be put from their employments and from 
his council, save only such as should be approved of by both 
Houses of Parliament ; and none put into their places but 
by approbation of the said Houses. And that all privy- 
councillors take an oath for the due execution of their 
places, in such form as shall be agreed upon by the said 
Houses. 

2. That the great affairs of the kingdom be debated, 
resolved, and transacted only in Parliament ; and such as 
shall presume to do anything to the contrary, be reserved 
to the censure of the Parliament; and such other matters of 
state, as are proper for his Majesty's privy-council, shall be 
debated and concluded, by such as shall from time to time 
be chosen for that place by both Houses of Parliament; and 
that no public act concerning the affairs of the kingdom, 
which are proper for his privy-council, be esteemed valid, as 
proceeding from the royal authority, unless it be done by 
the advice and consent of the major part of the council^ 
attested under their hands; and that the council be not 
more than twenty-five, nor less than fifteen; and that when 
a councillor's place falls void in the interval of Parliament, 
it shall not be supplied without the assent of the major part 
of the council ; and that such choice also shall be void, if 
the next Parliament after confirm it not 

3. That the Lord High Steward of England, Lord High 
Constable, Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great 



BEHEMOTH. DiiahgHi 2. 

Seal, Lord TVeasuxer, Lord Privy-Seal, Earl Marshal, Lord 
Admiral, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Chief Governor of 
Ireland, Chancdlor of the Exdiequer, Master of the Wards, 
Secretaries of State, two Chief Justices and Chief Baron, 
be always chosen with approbation of both Houses of Par* 
liament ; and in the intervals of Parliaments by the major 
pait of the privy-coundL 

4. That the governors of the King's children shall be 
such as both Houses shall approve of; and in the intervals 
of Parliament, such as the privy-council shall approve of; 
that the servants then about them, against whom the Houses 
have just exception, shall be removed. 

5. That no marriage be concluded or treated of for any 
of the King's children, without consent of Parliament 

6. That the laws in force against Jesuits, priests, and 
popish recusants, be strictly put in execution. 

7. That the votes of Popish lords in the House of Peers 
be taken away, and that a bill be passed for the education of 
the children of Papists in the Protestant religion. 

8. That the King will be pleased to reform the Church- 
government and liturgy in such manner as both Houses of 
Parliament shall advise. 

9. That he would be pleased to rest satisfied with that 
course that the Lords and Commons have appointed for 
ordering the militia; and recall his declarations and procla- 
mations against it 

la That such members as have been put out of any 
place or office since this Parliament began, may be restored, 
or have satisfaction. 

11. That all privy-councillors and judges take an oath 
(the form whereof shall be agreed on and settled by act of 
Parliament), for the maintaining of the Petition of Bight, 
and of certain statutes made by this Parliament. 

12. That all the judges and officers placed by approbation 
of both Houses of Parliament, may hold their places quam 
diu bene se gesserint 

i^ That the justice of Parliament may pass upon all 



DioUgm 1. BEHEMOTH. tog 



tfaejr be witfatii the kingdom or fled oiit 
of it ; and that til persons dted bjr either House of FuU*- 
menty may appear and abide the censure of Parliament 

14. That the general pardon offered by his Majestj, be 
granted with such exceptions as shall be adraed by both 
Houses of Parliament 

£. What a spiteful article was this! All the rest proceeded 
from ambition, which many times well-natured men are 
subject to; but this proceeded from an inhuman and devilish 
cruelty. 

A. 15. That the forts and castles be put under the com- 
mand of such persons as, with the approbation of the Par* 
liament, the King shall appoint. 

16. That the extraordinary guards about the King be 
discharged ; and for the future none raised but according 
to the law, in case of actual rebellion or invasioiL 

B. Methinks these very propositions sent to the King are 
an actual rebellion. 

A. 1 7. That his Majesty *be pleased to* enter into a more 
strict alliance with the United Provinces, and other neigh- 
bour Protestant Princes and States. 

18. That his Majesty be pleased, by act of Parliament, to 
clear the Lord Kimbolton and the five members of the 
House of Commons, in such manner as that future Parlia- 
ments may be secured from the consequence of that evil 
precedent 

19. That his Majesty be pleased to pass a bill for restrain- 
ing peers made hereafter, from sitting or voting in Parliar 
ment, unless they be admitted with the consent of both 
Houses of Parliament 

These propositions granted, they promise to apply them- 
selves to regulate his Majesty's revenue to his best advantage, 
and to settle it to the support of his royal dignity in honour 
and plenty ; and also to put the town of Hull into such ' 
hands as his Majesty shall appoint with consent of Parlia- 
ment 

B. Is not that to put it into such hands as his Majesty '

ihair appoint bjr the consent of the petitioherii which is no 
more than to keep it in their hands as it is? Did they want, 
or think the King wanted, common senses so as not to per- 
ceive that their promise herein was worth nothing? 

A. After the sending of these propositions to the King, 
and his Majesty's refusal to grant them, they began, on both 
sides, to prepare for war. The King raising a guard for his 
person in Yorkshire ; and the Parliament, thereupon having 
voted that the King intended to make war upon his Parlia- 
ment, gave order for the mustering and exercising the people 
in arms, and published propositions to invite and encourage 
them to bring in either ready money or plate, or to promise 
under their hands to furnish and maintain certain numbers 
of horse, horsemen, and arms, for the defence of the King 
and Parliament (meaning by King, as they had formerly 
declared, not his person, but his laws) ; promising to repay 
their money with interest of 8/. in the 100/. and the value of 
their plate with twelve-pence the ounce for the fashion. On 
the other side, the King came to Nottingham, and there did 
set up his standard royal, and sent out commissions of array 
to call those to him, which by the ancient laws of England 
were bound to serve him in the wars. Upon this occasion 
there passed divers declarations between the King and Par- 
liament concerning the legality of this array, which are too 
long to tell you at this time. 

B. Nor do I desire to hear any mooting about this 
question. For I think that general law of saius popuH^ and* 
the right of defending himself against those that had taken 
from him the sovereign power, are sufficient to make legal 
whatsoever he should do in order to the recovery of his 
kingdom, or to the punishing of the rebels. 

A. In the meantime the Parliament raised an army, and 
made the Earl of Essex general thereof; by which act they 
declared what they meant formerly; when they petitioned the 
King for a guard to be commanded by the said Earl of 
Essex. And now the King sends out his proclamations, 
forbidding obedience to the orders of the Parliament con-

though it were a war before^ 3fet there was no blood shed; 
they shot at one another nothing but paper. 

B. I understand now, how the Pailiament de s troyed die 
peace of the kingdom; and how easily, by the help of 
seditious Presbyterian ministers, and of ambitious ignorant 
orators, they reduced this government into anarchy. But I 
believe it will be a harder task for them to bring in peace 
again, and settie the government, either in themselves, or in 
any other governor, or form of government For, granting 
that they obtained the victory in this war, they must be 
beholding for it to the valour, good conduct, or felicity of 
those to whom they give the command of their armies ; 
especially to the general, whose good success will, without 
doubt, draw with it the love and admiration of the soldiers ; 
so that it will be in his power, either to take the government 
upon himself, or to place it where he himself thinks good. 
In which case, if he take it not to himself, he will be thought 
a fool ; and if he do, he shall be sure to have the envy of his 
subordinate commanders, who *will* look for a share either in 
the present government, or in the succession to it For they 
will say : " Has he obtained this power by his own, without 
our danger, valour, and counsel? and must we be his slaves, 
whom we have thus raised? Or, is not there as much 
justice on our side against him, as was on his side against 
the King?" 

A. They will, and did ; insomuch, that it was the reason 
why Cromwell, after he had gotten into his own hands the 
absolute power of England, Scotland, and Ireland, by the 
name of Protector, did never dare to take upon him the 
title of King, nor was ever able to settle it upon his chil- 
dren. His officers would not suffer it, as pretending after his 
death to succeed him ; nor would the army consent to it, 
because he had ever declared to them against the govern- 
ment of a single person.

\rf die great purse of the dtj of London, and contributions 
of almost all the towns corporate in England, and famished 
^tfa arms, as fiillj as they could require ? 

A. Tis trae, the King had great disadvantages, and yet 
by little and little he got a considemble army, with which he 
so prospered, as to grow stronger every day, and the Parlia- 
ment weaker; till they had gotten the Scots, with an army 
of ax,ooo men, to come into England to their assistance. 
But to enter into the particular narration of what was done 
in the war, I have not now time. 

B. Well then ; we will talk of that at next meeting. 



DIALOGUE in. 

B. Wk left at the preparations on both sides for war ; 
which, when I considered by myseli^ I was mightily puzzled 
to find out what possibility there was for the King to equal 
the Parliament in such a course^ and what hopes he had of 
money, men, arms, fortified places, shipping, counsel, and 
military officers, sufficient for such an enteqNrise against the 
Parliament, that had men and money as much at command, 
as the city of London, and other corporation towns, were 
able to furobh, which was more than they needed And 
for the men they should set forth for soldiers, they were 
akaost all of them spitefully bent against the King and his 
whole party, whom they took to be either papists, or flatterers 
of the King, or that hsA designed to raise their fortunes by 
the plunder of the city and other corporation towns. And 
though I believe not that they were more valiant than other 
men, nor that they had so much experience in the war, as to 
be accounted good soldiers; yet they had that in them, 
which in time of battle is more conducing to victory than 
valour and experience both together ; and that was spite.

before this time) to oblige him to be there continuaUy. But 
I believe verily, that the unfortunateness of his marriajges 
had so discountenanced his conversation with ladies, that 
the court could not be his proper element, unless he had had 
some extraordinary favour there, to balance that calamity. 
But for particular discontent from the King, or intention of 
revenge for any supposed disgrace, I think he had none, 
nor that he was anyways addicted to Presbyterian doctrines, 
or other fanatic tenets in Church or State ; saving only, that 
he was carried away with the stream (in a manner) of the 
whole nation, to think that England was not an absolute, 
but a mixed monarchy ; not considering that the supreme 
power must always be absolute, whether it be in the King 
or in the Parliament. 
B. Who was general of the King's army ? 

A. None yet but himself; nor indeed had he yet any 
army. But there coming to him at that time his two 
nephews. Prince Rupert and Maurice, he put the command 
of his horse into the hands of Prince Rupert, a man than 
whom no man living has a better courage, nor was more 
active and diligent in prosecuting his commissions ; and, 
though but a young man then, was not without experience 
in the conducting of soldiers, as having been an actor in 
part of his father's wars in Germany. 

B. But how could the King find money to pay such an 
army as was necessary for him against the Parliament ? 

A. Neither the King nor Parliament had much money at 
that time in their own hands, but were fain to rely upon the 
benevolence of those that took their parts. Wherein (I 
confess) the Parliament had a mighty great advantage. 
Those that helped the King in that kind were only lords 
and gentlemen, which, not approving the proceedings of the 
Parliament, were willing to undertake the payment, every 
one, of a certain number of horse ; which cannot be thought 
any great assistance, the persons that paid them being so 
few. For other moneys that the King then had, I have not 
heard of any, but what he borrowed upon jewels in the Low

Coimtries. Whereas the Fuliaiiieiit had a verjr plentiftil 
contribution, not only fiom London, bat generallj fiom 
their £u:tion in all other pbicet of Enghmd, upon certain 
propositions (published 1^ the Lords and Commons in 
June 1642, at what time they had newly voted that the King 
intended to make war upon themX for bringing in of money 
or plate to maintain horse and horsemen, and to buy arms 
for the preservation of the public peace, and for the defence 
of the Kmg and both Houses of Pariiament ; for the re- 
payment of which money and plate, they were to have the 
public faith. 

B. What public faith is there, when there is no public? 
\Vhat is it that can be called public, in a civil war, without 
the King? 

A. The truth is, the security was nothing worth, but 
served well enough to gull those seditious blockheads, that 
were .more fond of change than either of their peace or 
profit. 

Having by this means gotten contributions from those 
that were the well-affected to their cause, they made use of 
it afterward to force the like contribution from others. For 
in November following, they made an ordinance for assessing 
also of those that had not contributed then, or had con- 
tributed, but not proportionably to their estates. And yet 
this was contrary to what the Parliament promised and de- 
clared in the propositions themselves. For they declared, 
in the first proposition, that no man's affection should be 
measured by the proportion of his offer, so that he expressed 
his good-will to the service in any proportion whatsoever. 

Besides this, in the beginning of March following, they 
made an ordinance, to levy weekly a great sum of money 
upon every county, city, town, place, and person of any 
estate almost, in England; which weekly sum (as may 
appear by the ordinance itself, printed and published in March 
1642, by order of both Houses) comes to almost 33,000/., 
and consequently to above 1,700,000/. for the year. They 
had, besides all this, the profits of the King's lands and 



114 .BEHEMOTH. Dialogui y. 

woods, and whatsoeirer was remaining unpaid of any sub- 
sidies formerly granted him, and the tonnage and poundage 
usually received by the King; besides the profit of the 
sequestrations of great persons, whom they pleased to vote 
delinquents, and the profits of the bishops' Umds, which they 
took to themselves a year, or a little more, after. 

B. Seeing then the Parliament had such advantage of the 
King in money and arms and multitude of men, and had in 
their hands the King's fleet, I cannot imagine what hope the 
King could have, either of victory or (unless he resigned 
into their hands the sovereignty) of subsisting. For I can- 
not well believe he had any advantage of them, either in 
counsellors, conductors, or in the resolutions^of his soldiers. 

A, On the contrary, I think he had some disadvantage 
also in that ; for though he had as good officers at least as 
any that then served the Parliament, yet I doubt he had not 
so usefiil counsel as was necessary. And for his soldiers, 
though they were men as stout as theirs, yet, because their 
valour was not sharpened so with malice as theirs were of the 
other side, they fought not so keenly as their enemies did : 
amongst whom there were a great many London apprentices, 
who, for want of experience in the war, would have been 
fearful enough of death and wounds approaching visibly in 
glistering swords; but, for want of judgment, scarce thought 
of such death as comes invisibly in a bullet, and therefore 
were very hardly to be driven out of the field. 

B, But what fault do you find in the King's counsellors, 
lords, and other persons of quality and experience? 

A. Only that fault, which was generally in the whole 
nation, which was, that they thought the government. of 
England was not an absolute, but a mixed monarchy; and 
that if the King should clearly subdue this Parliament, that 
his power would be what he pleased, and theirs as little as 
he pleased: which they counted tyranny. This opinion, 
though it did not lessen their endeavour to gain the victory 
for the King in a battle, when a batde could not be avoided, 
yet it weakened their endeavour to procure him an absolute 



Diahgim 3. BEHEMOTH. 

victory in the wtr. And for thb onie^ nolwithitandtfig that 
they saw that the Piiiiament was firmly resohed to take all 
kingly power whatsoever oat of his hands, yet their ooansel 
to the King was upon all occasions, to offer propositions to 
them of treaty and accommodation, and to make and publish 
declarations; which any man might easily have foreseen 
would be fruitless; and not only so, but also of great ^»- 
advantage to those actions by which the King was to recover 
his crown and preserve his life. For it took away the courage 
of the best and forwardest of his soldiers, that looked for 
great benefit by their service out of the estates of the rebelSi 
in case they could subdue them ; but none at all, if the 
business should oe ended by a treaty. 

B. And they had reason : for a civil war never ends by 
treaty, without the sacrifice of those who were on both sides 
the sharpest. You know well enough how things passed at 
the reconciliation of Augustus and Antonius in Rome. But 
I thought, that after they once began to levy soldiers one 
against another, that they would not any more have returned 
of either side to declarations, or other paper war, which, if 
it could have done any good, had done it long before this. 

A. But seeing the Parliament continued writing, and set 
forth their declarations to the people against the lawfulness 
of the King's commission of array, and sent petitions to the 
King as fierce and rebellious as ever they had done before^ 
demanding of him, that he would disband his soldiers, and 
come up to the Parliament, and leave those whom the Par- 
liament called delinquents (which were none but the King's 
best subjects) to their mercy, and pass such bills as they 
should advise him ; would you not have the King set forth 
declarations and proclamations against the illegality of their 
ordinances, by which they levied soldiers against him, and 
answer those insolent petitions of theirs? 

B. No ; it had done him no good before, and therefore 
was not likely to do him any afterwards. For the common 
people, whose hands were to decide the controversy, under* 
stood not the reasons of either party ; and for those that by

ambition were once set upon the enterprise of changing the 
government, they cared not much what was reason and 
justice in the cause, but what strength they might procure 
by seducing the multitude with remonstrances from the 
Parliament House, or by sermons in the churches. And to 
their petitions, I would not have had any answer made at 
all, more than this : that if they would disband their army, 
and put themselves upon hb mercy, they should find him 
more gracious than they expected. 

A. That had been a gallant answer indeed, if it had pro- 
ceeded from him after some extraordinary great victory in 
battle, or some extraordinary assurance of a victory at last in 
the whole war. 

B. AVhy, what could have happened to him worse, than 
at length he suflfered, notwithstanding his gentle answers, 
and aU his reasonable declarations ? 

A. Nothing ; but who knew that ? 

B. Any man might see that he was never like to be 
- restored to his right without victory : and such his stoutness 

being known to the people, would have brought to his 
assistance many more hands than all the arguments of law, 
or force of eloquence, couched in declarations and other 
writings, could have done, by far. And I wonder what kind 
of men they were, that hindered the King from taking this 
resolution ? 

A. You may know by the declarations themselves, which 
are very long and full of quotations of records and of cases 
formerly reported, that the penners of them were either 
lawyers (by profession), or such gentlemen as had the am- 
bition to be thought so. Besides, I told you before, that 
those which were then likeliest to have their counsel asked 
in this business, were averse to absolute monarchy, as also 
to absolute democracy or aristocracy, all which govern- 
ments they esteemed tyranny ; and were in love with ////jc- 
archy^ which they used to praise by the name of mixed 

' '* In love with monarchy " all the edd, except the one 0/ iSi$, which 
has, " with a sort of monarchy/' evidentlv by conjecture. 



Diml^f^ui J. BEHEMOTH. 

monarchj. though it wtie hideed nothing dse but poie 
anarchy. And those men, whose pens the King most used 
in these controvenies of law and politics, were such (if I 
have not been misinformed) as having been members of 
this Parliament, had declaimed against ship-money and 
other extra-parliamentary taxes, as much as any ; but when 
they saw the Psarliament grow higher in their demands 
than they thought they would have done, went over to 
the King's party. 
B. VVho were those? 

A. It is not necessary to name any man, seeing I have 
undertaken only a short narration of the follies and other 
faults of men during this trouble ; but not (by naming the 
persons) to give you, or any man else, occasion to esteem 
them the less, now that the fiiults on all sides have been 
forgiven. 

B. \Vhen the business was *now* brought to this height, by 
lev}Mng of soldiers and seizing of the navy and arms and 
other provisions on both sides, that no man was so blind as 
not to see they were in an estate of war one against another ; 
why did not the King (by proclamation or message), accord- 
ing to his undoubted right, dissolve the Parliament, and 
thereby diminish, in some part, the authority of their levies, 
and of other their unjust ordinances ? 

A. You have forgotten that I told yon, that the King 
himself, by a bill which he passed at the same time when 
he passed the bill for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, 
had given them authority to hold the Parliament till they 
should by consent of both Houses dissolve themselves. If 
therefore he had, by any proclamation or message to the 
Houses, dissolved them, they would, to their former defama- 
tions of his Majesty's actions, have added also this, that he 
was a breaker of his word : and not only in contempt of him 
have continued their session, but also have made advantage 
of it to the increase and strengthening of their own party. 

B. Would not the King's raising of an army against them 
be interpreted as a purpose to dissolve them by force ? And 



i8 BEHEMOTH. DUOogiu 3. 

WIS it not as grett a breach of pfomise to scatter them by 
forces as to dissolve them by proclamation? Besides, I 
cannot conceive that the passing of that act was otherwise 
intended than conditionally; so long as they should not 
ordam anything contrary to the sovereign right of the King ; 
which condition they had aheady by many of their ordi- 
nances broken. And I think that even by the law of equity, 
which is the unalterable law of nature, a man that has the 
sovereign power, cannot, if he would, give away the right of 
anything which is necessary for him to retain for the good 
government of his subjects, unless he do it in express words, 
saying, that he will have the sovereign power no longer. 
For the giving away that, which by consequence only, draws 
the sovereignty along with it, is not (I think) a giving away . 
of the sovereignty ; but an error, such as works nothing but 
an invalidity in the grant itself. And such was the King's 
passing of this bill for the continuing of the Parliament as 
long as the two Houses pleased. But now that the war was 
resolved on, on both sides, what needed any more dispute 
in writing ? 

A. I know not what need they had. But on both sides 
they thought it needful to hinder one another, as much as 
they could, from levying of soldiers ; and, therefore, the 
King did set forth declarations in print, to make the people 
know that they ought not to obey the officers of the new 
mUitia set up by ordinance of Parliament, and also to let 
them see the legality of his own commissions of array. And 
the Parliament on their part did the like^ to justify to the 
people the said ordinance, and to make the commission of 
array appear unlawful 

B. When the Parliament were levying of soldiers, was it 
not lawful for the King to levy sol<^ers to defend himself 
and his right, though there had been no other title for it but 
his own preservation, and that the name of commission of 
array had never before been heard of? 

A. For my part, I think there cannot be a better title for 
war, than the defence of a man's own right But the people.

their maxims and cases prejudged, whidi they call prece- 
dents; and made them think so well of thdr own know- 
ledge in the law, that they were very glad of this occasion 
to show it against the King, and thereby to gain a reputa- • 
tion with the Parliament of being good patriots and wise 
statesmea 
B. What was this commission of array ? 

A. King William the Conqueror had gotten into his 
hands by victory all the land in England, of which he dis- 
posed, some part as forests and chases for his recreation, 
and some part to lords and gentlemen that had assisted him 
or were to assist him in the wars. Upon which he laid a 
charge of service in his wars, some with more men and 
some with less, according to the lands he had given them : 
whereby, when the King sent men unto them with commis- 
sion to make use of their service, they were obliged to 
appear with arms, and accompany the King to the wars for 
a certain time at their own charges: and such were the 
commissions by which this King did then make his levies. 

B. Why then was it not legal ? 

A, No doubt but it was legal. But what did that amount 
to, with men that were already resolved to acknowledge for 
law nothing that was against their design of abolishing 
monarchy, and placing a sovereign and absolute arbitrary 
power in the House of Commons? 

B, To destroy monarchy, and set up the House of Com- 
mons, are two businesses. 

A. They found it so at last, but did not think it so then. 

B, Let us come now to the military part 

A, I intended only the story of their injustice, impu- 
dence, and hypocrisy ; therefore, for the proceeding of the 



BEHEMOTH. Diah/^mi. 

war, I refer you to the history thereof written at large in 
Engh'sh. I shall only make use of such a thread as is 
necessary for the filling up of such knavery, and folly also, 
as I shall observe in their several actions. 

From York the King went to Hull, where was his maga- 
zine of arms for the northern parts of England, to try if 
they would admit him. The Parliament had made Sir John 
Hotham governor of the town, who caused the gates to be 
shut, and presenting himself upon the walls flatly denied 
him entrance : for which the King caused him to be pro- 
claimed traitor, and sent a message to the Parliament to 
know if they owned the action ; *and they owned it*. 

B. Upon what grounds ? 

A, Their pretence was this: that neither this nor any 
other town in England was otherwise the King's, than in 
trust for the people of England. 

B. But what was that to the Parliament ? *Is the town 
therefore theirs?* 

A, Yes, say they ; for we are the Representative of the 
people of England 

B. I cannot see the force of this argument : we repre« 
sent the people, ergo^ all that the people has is ours. The 
mayor of Hull did represent the King. Is therefore all 
that the King had in Hull, the mayor's ? The people of 
England may be represented with limitations, as to deliver 
a petition or the like. Does it follow that they, who deliver 
the petition, have right to all the towns in England? 
When began this Parliament to be a Representative of Eng- 
land? Was it not November 3, 1640? Who was it the 
day before, that is, November 2, that had the right to keep 
the King out of Hull, and possess it for themselves ? For 
there was then no Parliament Whose was Hull then ? 

A. I think it was the King's, not only because it was 
called the King's town upon Hull, but because the King him- 
self did then and ever represent the person of the people of 
England. If he did not, who then did, the Parliament 
having no being?

B. Surely they were such as were esteeried the vncK

A. And were they also esteemed the wisest mee fif 
England, that chose them ?

wheie he gave a great defeat to three regiments of the Par- 
liament's forces, and so returned to Oxford. 
B. Why did not the King go on from Brentford? 

A. The Parliament, upon the first notice of the King's 
marching from Shrewsbury, caused all the trained-bands and 
the auxiliaries of the city of London (which was so frightened 
as to shut up all their shops) to be drawn forth ; so that 
there was a most complete and numerous army ready for the 
Earl of Essex, that was crept into London just at the time 
to head it And this was it that made the King retire to 
Oxford. — In the beginning of February after, Prince Ru- 

. pert took Cirencester from the Parliament, with many pri- 
soners and many arms : for it was newly made a magazine. 
And thus stood the business between the King's and the 
Parliament's greatest forces. The Parliament in the mean- 
time caused a line of communication to be made about 
London and the suburbs, of twelve miles in compass ; and 
constituted a committee for the association, and the putting 
into a posture of defence, of the counties of Essex, Cam- 
bridge, Suffolk, and some others ; and one of these com- 
missioners was Oliver Cromwell, from which employment 
he came to his following greatness. 

B. What was done during this time in other parts of the 
country ? 

A. In the west, the Earl of Stamford had the employ- 
ment of putting in execution the ordinance of Parliament 
for the militia ; and Sir Raph Hopton for the King executed 
the commission of anay. Between these two was fought a 
battle at Liskeard in Cornwall, wherein Sir Raph Hopton 
had the victory, and presently took a town called Saltash, 
with many arms and much ordnance and many prisoners. 
Su: William Waller in the meantime seized Winchester and 
Chichester for the Parliament — In the north, for the commis- 
sion of array was my Lord of Newcastle, and for the miii/ia 
of the Parliament was my Lord Fairfax. My Lord of New- 
castle took from the Parliament Tadcaster, in which were a 
great part of the Parliament's forces for that country, and

I iiui ivhat Sf^at folly or wickedness do you observe in 
I'l I iili.iiiiuiil'i actions for this first year? 



n4 BEHEMOTH. IMciUiy. 

A. An that ctn be said against them m that point will be 
excused with the pretext of war, and come under one name 
of rebellion ; saving, that when they summoned any town, it 
was always in the name of the King and Parliament, the King 
being in the contrary army, and many times beating them 
from the si^ ; I do not see how the right of war can 
justify such impudence as that But they pretended that 
the King was always virtually in the two Houses of Parlia- 
ment ; making a distinction between his person natural and 
politic; which made the impudence greater, besides the 
folly of it For this was but an university quibble, such as 
boys make use of in maintaining (in the schools) such tenets 
as they cannot otherwise defend. 

In the end of this year they solicited also the Scots to enter 
England with an army, to suppress the power of the Earl of 
Newcastle in the north ; which was a plain confession, that 
the Parliament's forces were, at this time, inferior to the 
King's. And most men thought, that if the Earl of New- 
castle had then marched southward, and joined his forces 
with the King's, that most of the members of Parliament 
would have fled out of England. 

In the beginning of i643> ^^^ Parliament, seeing the Earl 
of Newcastle's power in the North grown so formidable, 
sent to the Scots to hire them to an invasion of England, 
and (to compliment them in the meantime) made a cove- 
nant amongst themselves, such as the Scots had before taken 
against episcopacy, and demolished crosses and church 
windows (such as had in them any images of saints) 
throughout all England. Also in the middle of the year, 
they made a solemn league with the nation, which was 
called the Solemn League and Covenant 

B. Are not the Scots as properly to be called foreigners 
as the Irish? Seeing then they persecuted the Earl of 
Strafford even to death, for advising the King to make use 
of Irish forces against the Parliament, with what face could 
they call in a Scotch army against the King ? 

A. The King's party might easily here have discerned 



Diahgmi > BEHEMOTH. 

their desigiiy to make themsdves abaolttte masten of the 
kingdom and to dethrone the Kling. Another great impa* 
dence, or rather abestial incivility^ it was of theirs* that they 
voted the Queen a traitor, for helping the King with some 
ammunition and English officers ■ from Holland. 

B. Was it possible that all this could be done, and men 
not see that papers and declarations must be useless; and 
that nothing could satisfy them but the deposing of the 
Kingi and setting up of themselves in his place ? 

A. Yes ; very possible. For who was there of them 
though knowing that the Kling had the sovereign power, 
that knew the essential rights of sovereignty? They dreamt 
of a mixed power, of the King and the two Houses. That 
it was a divided power, in which there could be no peace, 
was above their understanding. Therefore they were always 
urging the King to declarations and treaties (for fear of sub* 
jecting themselves to the King in an absolute obedience) ; 
which increased the hope and courage of the rebels, but did 
the King little good. For the people either understand not, 
or will not trouble themselves with controversies in writing, 
but rather, by his compliance and messages, go away with 
an opinion that the Parliament was likely to have the victory 
in the war. Besides, seeing the penners and contrivers of 
these papers were formerly members of the Parliament, and 
of another mind, and now revolted from the Parliament, 
because they could not bear that sway in the House which 
they expected, men were apt to think they believed not what 
they writ. 

As for military actions (to begin at the head-quarters) 
Prince Rupert took Birmingham, a garrison of the Parlia- 
ment's. In July after, the King's forces had a great victory 
over the Parliament's, near Devizes on Roundway-Down, 
where they took 2,000 prisoners, four brass pieces of ord- 
nance, twenty-eight colours, and all their baggage; and 
shortly after, Bristol was surrendered to Prince Rupert 
for the King; and the King himself marching into the 

' Forces from Holland.

west^ took fipom the Parliament many other considerable 

But this good fortune was not a little allayed by his be- 
sieging of Gloucester, which, after it was reduced to the last 
gasp, was relieved by the Earl of Essex ; whose army was 
before greatly wasted, but now suddenly recruited with the 
trained bands and apprentices of London. 

B. It seems, not only by this, but also by many examples 
in history, that there can hardly arise a long or dangerous 
rebellion, that has not some such overgrown city, with an 
army or two in its belly to foment it 

A. Nay more ; those great capital cities, when rebellion is 
upon pretence of grievances, must needs be of the rebel party : 
because the grievances are but taxes, to which citizens, that 
is, merchants, whose profession is their private gain, are 
naturally mortal enemies; their only glory being to grow 
excessively rich by the wisdom of buying and selling. 

B. But they are said to be of all callings the most bene- 
ficial to the commonwealth, by setting the poorer sort of 
people on work. 

A. That is to say, by making poor people sell their labour 
to them at their own prices ; so that poor people, for the 
most part, might get a better living by working in Bridewell, 
than by spinning, weaving, and other such labour as they 
can do; saving that by working slightly they may help 
themselves a little, to the disgrace of our manufacture. And 
as most commonly they are the first encouragers of rebellion, 
presuming of their own strength ; so also are they, for the 
most part, the first to repent, deceived by them that com- 
mand their strength. 

But to return to the war; though the King withdrew from 
Gloucester, yet it was not to fiy from, but to fight with the 
Earl of Essex, which presently after he did at Newbury, 
where the battle was bloody, and the King had not the 
worst, unless Cirencester be put into the scale, which the 
Earl of Essex had in his way a few days before surprised. 

But in the north and the west, the King had much the 



Dial^miy. BEHEMOTH. itf 

better of the PaiUament For in the northi at die nsy 
beginning of the year, March 39th, the Earls of Newcastle 
and Cumberland defeated the Lord Fair&x (who commanded 
in those parts for the Parliament) at Bramham Moor ; 
which made the Ftoliament to hasten the assistance of the 
Scots. 

In June folloiring the Earl of Newcastle routed Sir 
Thomas Fairfax (son to the Lord Fair&x) upon Adderton 
Heath; and| in pursuit of them to Bradford, took and killed 
3,000 men; and the next day took the town and 3,000 pri- 
soners more (Sir Thomas himself hardly escaping), with all 
their arms and ammunition ; and besides this, made the 
Lord Fairfax quit Halifax and Beverley. Lasdy, Prince 
Rupert relieved Newark, besieged by Sir John Meldrun (for 
the Parliament) with 7,000 men ; whereof 1,000 were slain, 
the rest upon articles departed, leaving behind them their 
arms, bag and baggage. 

To balance (in part) this success, the Earl of Manchester 
whose lieutenant-general was Oliver Cromwell, got a victory 
over the royalists near Horncastle, of whom he slew 400 
took 800 prisoners and 1,000 arms; and presently after 
took and plundered the city of Lincoln. 

In the West (May the i6th) Sir Raph Hopton at Strat- 
ton, in Devonshire, had a victory over the Parliamentarians, 
wherein he took 1,700 prisoners, thirteen pieces of brass 
ordnance, and all their ammunition, which was sevent)* 
barrels of powder, and the magazine of their other provi- 
sions in the towa 

Again at Lansdown, between Sir Raph Hopton and the 
Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller, was fought a 
fierce battle, wherein the victory was not very clear on either 
side ; saving that the Parliamentarians might seem to have 
the better, because presently after Sir William Waller fol- 
lowed Sir Raph Hopton to Devizes, in Wiltshire, though to 
his cost ; for there he was overthrown, as I have already 
told you. 

After this the King in person marched into the West, and

were all forced to lay down their arms, and upon condition 
never more to bear arms against the Kin|^ were permitted 
to depart 

In October following was fought a second and sharp battle 
it Newbury. Fbr this itifimtry, making no conscience of the 
conditions tnade with the Kingi being now come towards 
London as fiir as Basingstoke, had arms put again into their 
hands; to whom some of the trained-bands *of London"^ being 
added, die Earl of Essex had suddenly so great an army, 
that he attempted the King again at Newbury; and certainly 
had die better of the day, but the night parting diem, had 
not a complete victory^ And it was observed here, that no 
part of the Earl's army fought so keenly as they who had 
laid down dieir arms in ComwalL 

These were the most important fights of the year 1644 ; 
and die Kmg was yet (as both himself and others thought) 
in as good condition as the Parliament, which despaired of 
victory, by the commanders they then used Therefore they 
voted a new modelling of the army, suspecting the Earl of 
Essex, though I think wrongfully, to be too much a royalist, 
for not having done so much as they looked for, in this 
second batUe at Newbury. The Earls of Essex and Man- 
chester, perceiving what they went about, voluntarily laid 
down their commissions ; and the House of Commons made 
an ordinance, that no member of either House should enjoy 
any office or command, military or dvil ; with which oblique 
blow th^ shook off those that had hitherto served them too

A. For my part I doubt it not For a rightful king livings 
an usurping power can never be sufficiendy secured 

In this same year the Parliament put to death Sir John 
Hotham and his son, for having tampered ' with the Earl of 
Newcastle about the rendition of Hull ; and Sir Alexander 
Carew, for endeavouring to deliver up Plymouth, where he 
was governor for the Parliament; and the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, for nothing but to please the Scots; for the 
general article of going about to subvert the ftmdamental 
laws of the land, was no accusation, but only foul words. 
They then also voted down the Book of Common-prayer, 
and ordered the use of a Directory, which had been newly 
composed by an Assembly of Presbyterian ministers. They 
were also then, with much ado, prevailed with for a treaty 
with the King at Uxbridge ; where they remitted nothing of 
their former demands. The King had also at thb time a 
Parliament at Oxford, consisting of such discontented 
members as had left the Houses at Westminster; but 
few of them had changed their old principles, and there- 
fore that Parliament was not much worth. Nay rather, 
because they endeavoured nothing but messages and trea- 
ties, that is to say, defeating of the soldiers' hope of benefit 
by the war, they were thought by most men to do the King 
more hurt than good. 

The year 1645 was to the King very unfortunate; for by

the loss of one great battle, he lost all he had formerly 
gotten, and at length his life.— The new modelled army, 
after consultation whether they should lay siege to Oxford, 
ot march westward to the relief of Taunton (then besieged 
by the Lord Goring, and defended by Blake, famous after- 
wards for his actions at sea), resolved for Taunton ; leaving 
Cromwell to attend the motions of the King, though not 
strong enough to hinder him. The King upon tbb advan- 
tage drew out his forces and artillery out of Oxford. This 
made the Parliament to call back their general, Fairfax, and 
order him to besiege Oxford. The King in the meantime 
. relieved Chester, which was besieged by Sir William Brere- 
ton, and coming back took Leicester by force ; a place of 
great importance, well provided of artillery and provision. 

Upon this success it was generally thought that the King's 
party was the stronger. The King himself thought so ; and 
the Parliament in a manner confessed the same, by com- 
manding Fairfax to rise from the siege, and endeavour to 
give the King battle. For the successes of the King, and 
the divisions and treacheries growing now amongst them- 
selves, had driven them to rely upon the fortune of one day ; 
in which, at Naseby, the King*s army was utterly overthrown, 
and no hope left him to raise another. Therefore after the 
battle, with a small party he went up and down, doing the 
Parliament here and there some shrewd turns, but never 
much increasing his number. 

Fairfax in the meantime first recovered Leicester, and 
then marching into the west, subdued it all, except only a 
few places, forcing with much ado my Lord Hopton (upon 
honourable conditions) to disband his army, and with the 
Prince of Wales to pass over to Scilly; whence not long 
after they went to Paris. 

In April, 1646, General Fairfax began to march back to 
Oxford. In the meantime Rainsborough, who besieged 
Woodstock, had it surrendered. The King therefore, who 
was now also returned to Oxford, from whence Woodstock 
is but six miles, not doubting but that he should there by

Fair&t be besieged, and having no innj-, to reBeve him; 
resolved to get away di^ised to the Scotch anny about 
Newark; and thither he came the 4th of May; and the 
Scotch anny, being upon remove homewards, carried him 
with them to Newcastle, whither he came May 13th. 

B. Why did the King trust himself with the Scots ? They 
were the first that rebelled. They were Presbjierians, id eit, 
cruel ; besides, they were indigent, and consequently mighl 
be suspected would sell him to his enemies for money. And 
lastly, they were too weak to defend him, or keep him ic 
their country, 

A. What could he have done better ? For he had in the 
winter before sent to the Parliament to get a pass for th< 
Duke of Richmond and others, to bring them propositions 
of peace; it was denied. He sent again; it was denied 
again. Then he desired he might come to them in per- 
son 1 this also was denied. He sent again and again tc 
the same purpose ; but instead of granting it, they made ar 
ordinance : that the commanders of the militia of London

loldien of the army are Afferent thii4;8,toiiiake the soldiers 
promise what the army mean not to perform. 

*A.* July the nth the Parliament sent their propositions 
to the King at Newcastle ; which propositions they pre- 
tended to be the only way to a settled and well gromided 
' peacCi They were brought by the Earl of Pembroke, the 
Earl of Suffolk, Sir Walter Earle, Sir John Hippisley, Mr. 
Goodwin, and Mr. Robinson ; whom the King asked if they 
had power to treat; and (when they said no) why they 
might not as well have been sent by a trumpeter. The 
propositions were the same dethroning ones, which they 
used to send, and therefore the King would not ^sent to 
them. Nor did the Scots swallow them at first, but made 
some exceptions against thiem ; only, it seems, to make the 
Parliament perceive they meant not to put the King into 
their hands gratis. And so at last the baigain was made 
between them; and upon the payment of 200,000/. the 
King was put into the hands of the commissioners, which 
the English Parliament sent down to receive him. 

B. What a vile complexion has this action, compounded 
of feigned religion, and very covetousness, cowardice, per- 
jury, and treachery ! 

A. Now the war, that seemed to justify many unseemly 
things, is ended, you will see almost nothing else in these 
rebels but baseness and falseness besides their folly. 

By this time the Parliament had taken in all the rest of 
the icing's garrisons ; whereof the last was Pendennis Castle, 
whither Duke Hamilton had been sent prisoner by the King. 

B: What was <done during thi;s time in Ireland and 
Scotland? 

A. In Ireland there had been a peace made by order 
from his Majesty for a time, which by divisions amongst 
the Irish was ill kept. The Popish party (the Pope's 
nuncio being then there) took this to be the time for de- 
livering themselves from their subjection to the English. 
Besides, the time of the peace was now expired. 

B. How were they subject to the English, more than the 



I>i^»gi* 3. BEHEMOTH. 

English to tbe Irish ? They were subject to the King of 
England; but so also were the English to the Eiiif; of 
Ireland. 

A. This distinction is somewhat too iubtil« Tor comiaoa 
understandings. — In Scotland the Marquis of Montrose for 
the King, with a very few men and miraculoos rictories, had 
ovemin all Scotland, where many of his forces (out of too 
much security) were permitted to be absent for awhile; of 
which the encmj- having in^-"''— "*^ ..,^-i—iy came upon 
them, and forced them to 1 Highlands to 

recruit ; where he began to rpc '^nKin, when hc was 

commanded by the King {then li of the Scots 

at Newcastle) to disband ; and *so- ne itd fromScotland 

by sea. 

In the end of the same year, 1646, the Parliament caused 
the King's Great Seal to be broken; also the King was 
brought to Holmeby. and there kept by the Parliament's 
commissioners. And here was an end of that war as to 
England and Scotland, but not to Ireland. About this 
lime also died the Earl of Essex, whom the ParUament had 
♦formerly* discarded. 

/(. Now that there was peace in England, and the King 
III iiiimm, in whom was the sovereign power ? 

A. Tlie right was certainly in the King, but the exercise 
w"" yet in nobody ; but contended for, as in a game 
\ iinU, without fighting, all the years 1647 and 1648, betweenl 
III': riir!i;tment and Oliver Cromwell, lieutenant-general to

bat the divine right was in themsdvei. After thifl, the city 
of Geneva, and divers other places beyond sea» having 
revolted from the papacy, set up presbyteries for the govern- 
ment of their sevexal churches. And divers English scholars, 
that went beyond sea during the persecution in the time of 
Queen Mary, were much taken with this government, and 
at thdr return in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and ever 
since, have endeavoured, to the great trouble of the Church 
and nation, to set up that government here^ wherein they 
might domineer, and applaud their own wit and learning. 
And these took upon tliem not only a Divine right, but also 
a Divine inspiration. And having been connived at, and 
countenanced sometimes in their frequent preaching, they 
introduced many strange and many pernicious doctrines, 
out«doing the Reformation (as they pretended) both of 
Luther and Calvin ; receding from the former divinity (or 
church philosophy, for religion is another thing) as much 
as Luther and Calvin had receded from the pope; and 
distracted their auditors into a great number of sects, as 
Brownists, Anabaptists, Independents, Fifth-monarchy-men, 
Quakers, and divers others, all commonly called by the 
name of fanatics : insomu(.h as there was no so dangerous 
an enen^ to the Presbyterians, as this brood of their own 
hatching. 

These were Cromwell's best cards, whereof he had a very 
great number in the army, and some in the House, whereof 
he himself was thought one; though he were nothing cer- 
tain, but applying himself always to the faction which was 
strongest, and was of a colour like it 

There were in the army a great number (if not the greatest 
part) that aimed only at rapine and sharing the lands and 
goods of their enemies ; and these also, upon the opinion 
they had of CromwelVs valour and conduct, thought they 
could not any way better arrive at their ends than by ad- 
hering to him. Lastly, in the Parliament itself, though not 
the major part, yet a considerable number were fanatics, 
enough to put in doubts, and cause delay in the resolutions 









DisUguty. BEHEMOTH. 

of the Hoofle^ and tometiiiies also bj advantage of a tfiia 
House to cany a Tote in &Toar of Oromwelli as ihej did 
upon the 26th of July. For whereas on the 4th of May 
precedent the Parliament had voted that the militia of 
London should be in the hands of a committee of citizens^ 
whereof the Lord Mayor for the time being should be one ; 
shortly after, the Independents, chancing to be the major 
part, made an ordinance, by which it was put into, hands 
more favourable to the army. 

The best cards the Parliament had, were the dty of 
London and the person of the King. The General, Sir 
Thomas Fairfax, was right Presbyterian, but in the hands 
of the army, and the army in the hands of Cromwell ; but 
which party should prevail, depended on the playing of the 
game. Cromwell protested still obedience and fidelity to 
the Parliament ; but meaning nothing less, bethought him 
and resolved on a way to excuse himself of all that he 
should do to the contrary, upon the army. Therefore he 
and his son-in-law, Commissary-General Ireton, as good at 
contriving as himself, and at speaking and writing better, 
contrive how to mutiny the army against the Parliament 
To this end they *secretly* spread a whisper through the 
army, that the Parliament, now they had the King, intended 
to disband them, to cheat them of their arrears, and to send 
them into Ireland to be destroyed by the Irish. The army 
being herewith enraged, were taught by Ireton to erect a 
council amongst themselves of two soldiers out of every 
troop and every company, to consult for the good of the 
army, and to assist at the council of war, and to advise for 
the peace and safety of the kingdom. These were called 
adjutators; so that whatsoever Cromwell would have to be 
done, he needed nothing to make them do it, but secretly 
to put it into the heads of these adjutators. The effect of 
their first consultation was to take the King from Holmeby, 
and to bring him to the army. 

The general hereupon, by letter to the Parliament, 
excuses himself and Cromwell, and the body of the army. 



•xjS BEHEMOTH. IHakpu 3. 

as igaoiint of the fiict; and that the King came away 
willingly with those soldiers that brought him : assuring 
them withal, that the whole army intended nothing but 
peace, nor opposed Presbytery, nor affected Independency, 
nor did hold any licentious freedom in religion. 

B. Tis strange that Sir Thomas Fair&x could be so 
abused by Cromwell as to believe this which he himself 
here writes. 

A* I cannot imagine that Comet Joyce could go out of 
* the army with 1,000 soldiers to fetch the King, and neither 
the general, nor the lieuteoan^-general, nor the body of the 
army tabs f^otice of if. And thiit the King went '''with them'*' 
willingly, appears to be false by a message sent on purpose 
from his Majesty to the Parliament 

B. Here is perfidy upon perfidy : first, the perfidy of the 
Parliament against the King^ and thisn the perfidy of the 
army against the Parliament. 

A. This was thefirst trick Cromwell played ^them,'" whereby 
he thought himself to have gotten so great an advantage, 
that he said openly^ ''that he had the Parliament in his 
pocket ; " as indeed he had, ai^d the city too. For upon 
the news of it fh^y wem, both the one ^n4 the other, in very 
great disorder; .^d the more, because there came with it 
a rumour thajt the army ijiras marching up to London. 

The King in the meantime, till his residence was settled 
at Hampton Court, was qirrjed from place to place, not 
without some ostentation; but with much more liberty, and 
with more respect shown him by far, than when he was in 
the hands of the Parliament's commissioners ; for his own 
chaplains were allowed him^ and his children and some 
friends permitted to see him. Besides that, he was much 
complimented by Cromwell, who promised him, in a serious 
a^d seeming passionate manner^ jto restore him to his right 
l^gaiQst the Parljamen.t. 

B* How was he sure he could do that ? 

A. He was not sure; but he was resolved to march up 
to the city and P^liament, to set up the King again (and 




Dialogut 3. BEHEMOTH. 

be the second man), unless in the attempt he fousd better 
hope, than jet he had, to make himself the first mas, bjr 
dispossessing the King, 

S. What assistance against the Parliament and the city 
could Cromwell expect from the King? 

A. By declaring directly for him, he might have had all 
the King's patty, which were many more now nncehis 
misfortune, than ever they were before. For tn the PariilH 
ment itself, there were many that had discovered the 
hypocrisy, and private aims of their fellows ; many were 
converted to their duty by their own natural reason ; and 
their compassion for the King's sufferings had begot generally 
an indignation against the Parliament : so that if they had 
been, by the protection of the present army, brought together 
and embodied, Cromwell might have done phaj: he had 
pleased, in the first place for the King, and in the second 
for himself. But it seems he meant first to try what he 
could do without the King; and if that proved enough, to 
rid his hands of him. 

B, ^Vhat did the Parliament and city do to oppose the 

A. First, the Parliament sent to the general to re-detiver the 
King to their commissioners. Instead of an answer to this, 
the army sent articles to the Parliament, and wjth them « 
charge against eleven of their members, all of them active 
Presbyterians ; of which articles these are some : i. That 
the House may be purged of those, who, by the self-denying 
ordinance, ought not to be there; z. That such as abused 
and endangered the kingdom, might be disabled to do the like 
hereafter; 3. That a. day might be appointed to determine 
this Parliament ; 4. That they would make an account to 
the kingdom of the vast sums of money they had received; 
5. Tlinf the eleven members might presently be suspended 
littin : House. These were the articles that put them 

I s ; and they answered none of them, but that 

•on of the eleven members, which they said

were produced : but this was soon answered with their own 
proceeding against the Archbishop of Canterbury and the 
Earl of Strafford 

The Parliament being thus somewhat awed» and the Kling 
made somewhat confident, Cromwell undertakes ' the city, 
requiring the Parliament to put the militia of London into 
other hands. 

B. What other hands ? I do not well understand yoiL 
. A. I told you that the militia of London was, on the 4th 
of May, put into the hands of the lord-mayor and other 
citizens, and soon after put into the hands of other men 
more favourable to the army. And now I am to tell you, 
that on July the 26th, the violence of certain apprentices 
and disbanded soldiers forced the Parliament to re-settle it 
as it was, in the citizens ; and hereupon the two speakers 
and divers of the members ran away to the army, where 
they were invited and contented to sit and vote in the 
council of war in nature of a Parliament And out of the 
citizens' hands they would have the militia taken away, and 
put again into those hands out of which it was taken the 
26th of July. 

B. What said the city to this ? 

A. The Londoners manned their works, viz. : the line oi 
communication ; raised an army of valiant men within the 
line ; chose good officers, all being desirous to go out and 
fight whensoever the city should give them order; and in 
that posture stood expecting the enemy. 

The soldiers in the meantime enter into an engagement to 
live and die with Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the Parliament, 
and the army. 

B. That is very fine. They imitate that which the Parlia- 
ment did, when they first took up arms against the King, 
styling themselves the King and Parliament, maintaining 
that the King was always virtually in his Parliament : so the 
army now, making war against the Parliament, called them 
selves the Parliament and the army : but they might, witb 

* fae undertakes— <tffr. H,

more leasoo, My, that the Padiamen^ nnce it wu In 
Cromwell's po<i«t, was virtually in the anny. 

A. Withal they send out a declaration of the groimds of 
their march tow&rds London ; wherein they take upon theip 
to be judges of the Parliament, and of who are fit to be 
trusted with the business of the kingdom, giving them the 
name, not of the Parliament, but of the gentlemen at 
Westminster. For since the violence they were under July 
the 26th, the army denied ^ ,. lo b " "il ParliamenL 
At the same time they sent « wttci ■..- mayor and alder- 
men of London, reproaching them hose late tumults ; 
telling them they were enemies to n.i, ^.^^tce, treacherous to 
the Parliament, unable to defend either the Parliament or 
themselves ; and demanded to have the city delivered into 
their hands, to which purpose, they said, they were now 
coming to them. The general also sent out his warrants to 
the counties adjacent, summoning their trained soldiers to 
join with them. 

B. Were the trained soldiers part of the general's army? 
A. No, noT at all in pay, nor could be without an order 

of ParliamenL But what might an army not do, after it had 
mastered all the laws of the land? The army being come 
to Hounslow Heath, distant from London but ten miles, the 
Court of Aldermen was called to consider what to do. The 
captains and soldiers of the city were willing, and well pro- 
vided, to go forth and give them battle. But a treacherous 
officer, that had charge of a work on Soulhwark side, had 
let in within the line a small party of the enemies, who 
marched as far as to the gate of London-bridge; and then 
the Court of Aldermen, their hearts failing them, submitted 
on these conditions : to relinquish their militia ; to desert 
the eleven members ; to deliver up the forts and line of 
communication, together with the Tower of London, and all 
magazines and arms therein, to the army ; to disband their 
forces and turn out the reformadoes, id est, all Essex's old 
soldiers ; to draw off the guards from the Parliament. All 
which was done, and the army marched triumphantly through 
the principal streets of the city. 



143 BEHEMOTH. Dialogue y. 

. J9. Itis ttranj^ that the mayorandaldenneiit having such an 
anny, should so quickly yield Might they not have resisted 
the party of the enemy at the bridge, widi a party of their 
own; and the rest of the enemies, with the rest of their own? 
A. I cannot judge of that : but to me it would have been 
strange if they had done otherwise. For I consider the 
most part of rich subjects, that have made themselves so by 
craft and trade, as men that never look upon anything but 
their present profit; and who, to everything not lying in 
that way, are in a manner blind, being amazed at the very 
thought of plundering. If they had understood what virtue 
there is to preserve their wealth in obedience to their lawful 
sovereign, they would never have sided with the Parliament ; 
and so we had had no need of arming. The mayor' and 
aldermen therefore, being assured by this submission to save 
their goods, and not sure of the same by resisting, seem to 
me to have taken the wisest course. Nor was the Parlia- 
ment less tame than the city. For presently, August the 
6th, the general brought the fugitive speakers and members 
to the House, with a strong guard of soldiers, and replaced 
the speakers in their chairs. And for this they gave the 
general thanks, not only there in the House, but appointed 
also a day for a holy thanksgiving ; and not long after made 
him Generalissimo of all the forces ,of England and Con- 
stable of the Tower. But in effect all this was the advance- 
ment of Cromwell ; for be was the usufructuary, though the 
property were in Sir Thomas Fairfax. For the Independents 
immediately cast down the whole line of communication ; 
divided the militia of London, Westminster and Southwark, 
which were before united; displaced such governors of 
towns and forts as were not for their turn, though placed 
there by ordinance of Parliament ; instead of whom, they 
put in men of their own party. They also made the Parlia- 
ment to declare null all that had passed in the Houses from 
July the 26th to August the 6th, and clapped in prison some 
of the lords, and some of the most eminent citizens, whereof 
the lord mayor was onei

Why did he it not? 

A. His main end wis to set MaaSt fai hb plaoe. The 
restoring of the King wmt but a reserve agunst the FiNtlia- 
ment, which beng in his pockety he had no more need of 
the King^ who was now an impediment to him. To keep 
him in the army was a trouble; to let him fiJl into the hands 
of the Presbyterians had been a stop to his hopes; to 
murder him privately (besides the horror of the act) now 
whilst he was no more than lieutenant-general, woold have 
made him odious without furthering hb design. There was 
nothing better for his purpose than to let him escape from 
Hampton Court (where he was too near the Parliament) 
whither he pleased beyond sea. For though Cromwell 
had a great party in the Parliament House whilst they saw 
not his ambition to be their master, yet they would have 
been his enemies as soon as that had appeared-^To make 
the King attempt an escape, some of those that had him in 
custody, by Cromwell's direction told him that the adjutators 
meant to murder him ; and withal caused a rumour of the 
same to be generally spread, to the end it might that way 
also come to the King's ear, as it did 

The King, thereforci in a dark and rainy night, his guards 
being retired, as it was thought, on purpose, left Hampton 
Court and went to the sea-side about Southampton, where a 
vessel had been bespoken to transport him, but failed; so 
that the King was forced to trust himself with Colonel 
Hammond, then governor of the Isle of Wight ; expecting 
perhaps some kindness from him, for Dr. Hammond's sake, 
brother to the colonel and his Majesty's much favoured ^ 
chjiplain. But it proved otherwise ; for the colonel sent to 
his masters of the Parliament, to receive their orders con- 
cerning him. This going into the Isle of Wight was not 
likely to be any part of Cromwell's design, who neither 
knew whither nor which way he would go ; nor had Ham- 
I mond known any more than other men, if the ship had 

come to the appointed place in due time.

' B* If iht King had escaped into Fiancey might not the 
nendi have assisted him with forces torecover his kingdom, 
and so frustrated the designs both of Cromwell and all the 
Sling's other enemies ? 

^. YeS| much ; just as they asnsted his son, our present 
most gracious Sovittdgn, who two years before fled thither 
out of Cornwall. 

B. It b methinks no great polity in neighbouring princes 
to fovour, so often as they do, one another's rebels, especially 
when they rebel against monarchy itsell They should 
rather, first, make a league against rebellion and afterwards, 
(if there be no remedy) fight one against another. Nor will 
that serve the turn amongst Christian sovereigns, till preach- 
ing be better looked to, whereby the interpretation of a 
verse in the Hebrew, Greek, or Latin Bible, is oftentimes 
the cause of civil war and the deposing and assassinating of 
God's anointed And yet, converse with those divinity- 
disputers as long as you will, you will hardly find one in a 
hundred discreet enough to be employed in any great affair, 
either of war or peace. It is not the right of ^e sovereign, 
though granted to him by every man's express consent, that 
can enable him to do his office ; it is the obedience of the 
subject, which must do that For what good is it to promise 
allegiance, and then by and by to cty out (as some ministers 
did in the pulpit) To your tenis^ O Israel/} Common 
people know nothing of right or wrong by their own medi- 
tation ; they must therefore be taught the grounds of their 
duty, and the reasons why calamities ever follow disobedience 
to Uieir lawful sovereigns. But to the contrary, our rebels 
were publicly taught rebellion in the pulpits ; and that there 
was no sin, but the doing of what the preachers forbade, or 
the omission of what they advised. — But now the King was 
the Parliament's prisoner, why did not the Presbyterians 
advance their own interest by restoring him ? 

A, The Parliament, in which there were more Presby- 
terians yet than Independents, might have gotten what they 
would of the King during his life, if they had not by an

unconadonable and sottish ambition obstmeled Ae waj to 
. their ends. They sent him four propositions, to be rigned 
and passed by him as Acts of Parliament; telling him, 
when these were granted, they would send commissioners to 
treat with him of any other articles. 

The propositions were these : First, that the Parliament 
should have the militia^ and the power of levying money to 
maintain it, for twenty years; and after that term, the 
exercise thereof to return to the King, in case the Parlia« 
ment think the safety of the kingdom concerned in it 

B. The first article takes fix)m the King the milUia^ and 
consequently the whole sovereignty for ever. 

A. The second was, that the King should justify the 
proceedings of the Parliament against himself; and declare 
void all declarations ' made by him against the Parliament 

B, This was to make him guilty of the war, and of all 
the blood spilt therein. 

A, The third was, to take away all titles of honour con- 
ferred by the King since the Great Seal was carried to him 
in May, 1642. 

The fourth was, that the Parliament should adjourn 
themselves, when, and to what place, and for what time 
they pleased. 

These propositions the King refused to grant, as he had 
reason ; but sent others of his own, not much less advan- 
tageous to the Parliament, and desired a personal treaty 
upon them with the Parliament, for the settling of the peace 
of the kingdom. But the Parliament denying them to be 
sufticient for that purpose, voted that there should be no 
more addresses made to him, nor messages received from 
him ; but that they would settle the kingdom without him. 
And this they voted partly upon the speeches and menaces 
of the army-faction then present in the House of Commons, 
whereof one advised these three points : i. To secure the 
King in some inland castle with guards; 2. To draw up 
articles of impeachment against him ; 3. To lay him by, 
and settle the kingdom without him.

Another taid» that his denying of the four bills was the 
denying protection to his subjects ; and that therefore they 
might deny him subjection; and added, that till the Parlia- 
ment forsook the army, the army would never forsake the 
Parliament. This was threatening. 

Last of all, Cromwell himself told them, it was now 
expected that the Parliament should govern and defend the 
kingdom, and not any longer let the people expect their 
safety from a man whose heart God had hardened ; nor let 
those, that had so well defended the Parliament, be left 
hereafter to the rage of an irreconcilable enemy, lest they 
seek their safety some other way. This again was threaten- 
ing ; as also the laying his hand upon his sword when he 
spake it. 

And hereupon the vote of non-addresses was made an 
ordinance ; which the House would afterwards have recalled, 
but was forced by Cromwell to keep their word. 

The Scots were displeased with it ; partly because their 
brethren the Presbyterians had lost a great deal of their 
power in England, and partly also, because they had sold 
the King into their hands. 

The King now published a passionate complaint to his 
people of this hard dealing with him ; which made them 
pity him, but not yet rise in his behalf. 

B. Was not this, think you, the true time for Cromwell to 
take possession ? 

A. By no means. There were yet many obstacles to be 
removed. He was not general of the army. The army 
was still for a Parliament The city of London discon- 
tented about their militia. The Scots expected with an 
army to rescue the King. His adjutators were levellers, and 
against monarchy, who though they had helped him to bring 
under the Parliament, yet, like dogs that are easily taught 
to fetch, and not easily taught to render, would not make 
him king. So that Cromwell had these businesses following 
to overcome, before he could formally make himself a 
sovereign prince : i. To be Generalissimo : 2. To remove 



DMogm 3. BEHEMOTH. 147 

the King : 3* To tappress aB insmrectioiis here : 4. To 
oppose the Scots : and lastljt to dissolve the present Pftriia- 
ment. Mighty bnsinessesi which he oould never promise 
himself to overcome. Therefore I cannot believe he then 
thought to be King ; but only by wdl serving the strongest 
party, which was always his main policy to proceed as fiuras 
that and fortune would carry him. 

B. The Parliament were certainly ik> less foolish than 
wicked, in deserting thus the King, before they had the 
army at a better command than they had. 

A. In the beginning of 1648 the Parliament gave com« 
mission to Philip Earl of Pembroke, then made Chancellor 
of Oxford, together with some of the doctors there as good 
divines as he, to purge the University. By virtue whereof 
they turned out all such as were not of their &ction, and all 
sudi as had approved the use of the Common-prayer-book ; 
as also divers scandalous ministers and scholars (that is» 
such as customarily without need took the name of God 
into their mouths, or used to speak wantonly, or haunt the 
company of lewd women). And for this last I caimot but 
commend them. 

B. So shall not I ; for it is just such another piece of 
piety, as to turn men out of an hospital because they are 
lame. Where can a man probably learn godliness, and how 
to correct his vices, better than in the universities erected 
for that purpose ? 

A, It may be, the Parliament thought otherwise. For 
I have often heard the complaints of parents, that their 
children were debauched there to drunkenness, wantonness, 
gaming, and other vices consequent to these. Nor is it a 
wonder amongst so many youths, if they did corrupt one 
another in despite of their tutors, who oftentimes were litde 
elder than themselves. And therefore I think the Parlia- 
ment did not much reverence that institution of universities, 
as to the bringing up of young men to virtue ; though many 
of them learned there to preach, and became thereby 
capable of preferment and maintenance ; and some others 



148 BEHEMOTH. Dialofciu 3 

were sent thither by their parents, to save themselves the 
trouble of governing them at home, daring that time where- 
in children are least governable. Nor do I think the 
Parliament cared more for the clergy than other men did. 
But certainly an university is an excellent servant to the 
clergy ; and the clergy, if it be not carefully looked to (by 
their dissensions in doctrines and by the advantage to 
publish their dissensions), is an excellent means to divide 
a kingdom into factions* 

B. But seeing there is no place in this part of the world, 
where philosophy and other humane sciences are not highly 
valued; where can they be learned better' than in the 
Universities ? 

A. What other sciences? Do not divines comprehend 
alldvil and moral philosophy within their divinity? And 
as for natural philosophy, is it not removed from Oxford and 
Cambridge to Gresham College in London, and to be 
learned out of their gazettes ? But we are gone from our 
subject 

B. No ; we are indeed gone from the greater businesses 
of the kingdom ; to which, if you please, let us return. 

A. The first insurrection, or rather tumult, was that of the 
apprentices, on the 9th of April. But this was not upon 
the King's account, but arose from a customary assembly 
of them for recreation in Moorfields, whence some zealous 
officers of the trained soldiers would needs drive them away 
by force ; but were themselves routed with stones ; and had 
their ensign taken away by the apprentices, which they 
carried about in the streets, and frighted the lord mayor 
into his house ; where they took a gun called a drake ; and 
then they set guards at some of the gates, and all the rest of 
the day childishly swaggered up and down : but the next 
day the general himself marching into the city, quickly 
dispersed them. This was but a small business, but enough 
to let them see that the Parliament was "'but"' ill-beloved of 
the people. 

Next, the Welch took arms against them. There wer 



i DMogm 3* BEHEMOTH. 

\ three oolonds in Wales, Lan^orne^ Pojer, and Powd, who 

I had formerly done the Paxliament good service^ but now 

were commanded to disband ; which they refused to do; 
and the better to strengthen themsehresi declared for the 
King ; and were about 8,000. 

About the same time^ m Wales alsOi was another insur- 
rection, headed by Sir Nicholas Keymish, and another 
under Sir John Owen ; so that now all Wales was in rebel- 
lion against the Parliament: and yet all these were overcome 
in a month's time by Cromwell and his officers; but not 
without store of bloodshed on both sides. 

£. I do not much pity the loss of those men, that impute 
to the King that which Uiey do upon their own quarrel. 

A» Presently after this, some of the people of Surrey sent 
a petition to the Parliament for a personal treaty between the 
King and the Parliament ; but their messengers were beaten 
home again by the soldiers that were quartered about West- 
minster and the mews. And then the Kentish men having 
a like petition to deliver, and seeing how ill it was like to be 
received, threw it away and took up arms. They had many 
gallant officers, and for general the Earl of Norwich ; and 
increased daily by apprentices and old dbbanded soldiers. 
Insomuch as the Parliament was glad to restore to the city 
their militia, and to keep guards on the Thames side : and 
then Fairfax marched towards the enemy. 

B, And then the Londoners, I think, might easily and 
suddenly have mastered, first the Parliament, and next 
Fairfax his 8,000, and lastly Cromwell's army ; or at least 
have given the Scotch army opportunity to march un- 
foughten to London. 

A, It is true : but the city was never good at venturing ; 
nor were they or the Scots principled to have a King over 
them, but under them. Fairfax marching with his 8,000 
against the royalists, routed a part of them at Maidstone ; 
another part were taking in of places in Kent further off; 
and the Earl of Norwich with the rest came to Blackheath, 
and thence sent to the city to get passage through it, to join 



ISO BEHEMOTH. DiaUgue y, 

with those which were risen in Esmz onder Sir CHuiries 
Lncas and Sir George Lisle; which bebg denied, the 
greatest part of his Kentish men deserted him. With the 
test, not above 500, he crossed the Thames into the Isle of 
DogSy and so to Bow, and thence to Colchester. Fair&x 
having notice of this, crossed the Thames at Gravesend ; 
and overtaking them, besieged them in Colchester. The 
town had no defence but a breastwork, and yet held out, 
upon hope of the Scotch army to relieve them, the space of 
two months. . Upon news of the defeat of the Scots they 
were forced to yield. The Earl of Norwich was sent prisoner 
to London. Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, two 
loyal and gallant persons, were shot to death. There was 
also another little insurrection, headed by the Earl of 
Holland, about Kingston ; but quickly suppressed, and he 
himself taken prisoner. 

B. How came the Scots to be so soon dispatched ? 

A. Merely (as it is said) for want of conduct Their 
army was led by Duke Hamilton, who was then set at 
liberty, when Pendennis Castle, where he was prisoner, was 
taken by the Parliamentarians. He entered England with 
horse and foot 15,000, to which came in above 3,000 English 
royalists. Against these Cromwell marched out of Wales 
with horse and foot 11,000, and near to Preston in Lanca- 
shire, in less than two hours, defeated them. And the 
cause of it is said to be, that the Scotch army was so 
ordered as they could not all come to the fight, nor relieve 
their fellows. After the defeat, they had no way to fly but 
further into England; so that in the pursuit they were 
almost all taken, and lost all that an army can lose ; for the 
few that got home, did not all bring home their swords. 
Duke Hamilton was taken, and not long after sent to 
London. But Cromwell marched on to Edinburgh, and 
there^ by the help of the faction which was contrary to 
Hamilton's, he made sure not to be hindered in his designs; 
the first whereof was to take away the King's life by the 
hand of the Parliament

B. YeS| no doubt 

A. Do you think the Parliament would have thought it 
reasonable to be called to account by this representative? 

B. No, sure ; and yet I must confess the case is the same. 
A. This ordinance contained, first, a summary of the 

charge against the King, in substance this : that not content 
with the encroachments of his predecessors upon the free- 
dom of the people, he had designed to set up a tyrannical 
government ; and to that end, had raised and maintained in 
the land a civil war against the Parliament, whereby the 
country hath been miserably wasted, the public treasure 
exhausted, thousands of people murdered, and infinite other 
mischiefs committed Secondly, a constitution passed of a 
high court of justice, that is, of a certain number of com- 
missioners, of whom any twenty had power to try the King, 
and to proceed to sentence accordmg to the merit of the 
cause, and see it speedily executed. 

The commissioners met on Saturday, January 20th, in 
Westminister Hall, and the King was brought before them ; 
where, sitting in a chair, he heard the charge read, but denied 
to plead to it either guilty or not guilty, till he should know 
by what lawful authority he was brought thither. The presi- 
dent told him that the Parliament affirmed their own au- 
thority; and the King persevered in his refusal to plead 
l*hough many words passed between him and the president, 
yet this was the substance of it alL 

On Monday, January 22nd, the court met again ; and then 
the solicitor moved that if the King persisted in denying the 
authority of the courts the charge might be taken pro confesso: 
but the King still denied their authority. 



I J4 BEHEMOTH. Didhgue 3. 

They met again January the 13rd, and then the solicitor 
moved the court for judgment ; whereupon the Kirig was 
required to give his final answer ; which was again a denial 
of their authori^. 

Lastly, they met again January the 37th, where the King 
desired to be heard before the Lords and Commons in the 
Painted Chamber, and prombing after that to abide the 
judgment of the court The commissioners redred for half 
an hour to consider of it, and then returning caused the 
King to be brought again to the bar, and told him that what 
he proposed was but another denial of the court's jurisdic- ' 
tion; and that if he had no more to say, they would proceed. 
Then the King answering that he had no more to say, the 
president began a long speech in justification of the Parlia- 
ment's proceedings, producing the examples of many kings 
killed or deposed by wicked Parliaments,ancient and modem, 
in Englanci^ Scotland, and other parts of the world. All 
which he endeavoured to justify from this only principle : 
that the people have the supreme power, and the Parliament 
is the people. This speech ended, the sentence of death 
was read ; and the same upon Tuesday after, January 30th, 
executed at the gate of his own palace of Wliitehall He 
that can delight in reading how villainously he was used by 
the soldiers between the sentence and execution, may go to 
the chronicle itself; in which he shall see what courage, 
patience, wisdom, and goodness was in this prince, whom in 
their charge the members of that wicked Parliament styled 
tyrant, traitor, and murderer. 

The King being dead, the same day they made an act of 
Parliament : that whereas several pretences might be made 
to the crown, &c, it is enacted by this present Parliament 
and by authority of the same, that no person presume to 
declare, proclaim, or publish, or any way promote Charles 
Stuart, son of Charles late King of England, commonly 
called Prince of Wales, or any other person, to be King of 
England or Ireland, &c. 

B, Seeing the King was dead, and his successor barred ; 
by what declared authority was the peace maintained ? 



DM^fUii. . BEHEMOTH. 155 

A. They had, in their anger against the Lotdib formeiljr 
declared the supreme power of the nation to be in die House 
of Commons ; and now, on Febniary the sth, they vote the 
House of Lords to be useless and dangerouSi And thus the 
kingdom is turned into a democracy, or rather an oligarchy; 
for presently they made an act : that none of those members, 
who were secluded for opposing the vote of non-addresses, 
should ever be re-admitted. And these were commonly 
called the secluded members; and the rest were by some 
styled a Parliament, and by others the Rump. 

I think you need not now have a catalogue, either of the 
vices, or of the crimes, or of the follies of the greatest part 
of them that composed the Long Parliament ; than which 
greater cannot be in the world What greater vices than 
irreligion, hypocrisy, avarice and cruelty; which have ap- 
peared so eminently in the actions of Presbyterian members 
and Presbyterian ministers? What greater crimes than 
blaspheming and killing God's anointed? which was done 
by the hands of the Independents, but by the folly and first 
treason of the Presbyterians, who betrayed and sold him to 
his murderers? Nor was it a little folly in the Lords, hot to 
see that by the taking away of the King's power they lost 
withal their own privileges ; or to think themselves, either 
for number or judgment, any way a considerable assistance 
to the House of Commons. And for those men who had 
skill in the laws, it was no great sign of understanding not 
to perceive that the laws of the land were made by the King, 
to oblige his subjects to peace and justice, and not to oblige 
himself that made them. And lastly and generally, all men 
are fools which pull down anything which does them good, 
before they have set up something better in its place. He 
that would set up democracy with an army, should have an 
army to maintain it ; but these men did it, when those men 
had the army that were resolved to pull it down. To these 
follies I might add the folly of those fine men, which out of 
their reading of Tully, Seneca, or other anti-monarchies, think 
themselves sufficient politics, and show their discontent when

theyue not called to the management of the states and turn 
from one side to another upon every neglect they fimcy from 
the King or his enemies. 



DIALOGUE IV. 

A. You have seen the Rump in possession (as they believed) 
of the supreme power over the two nations England and 
Ireland, and the army their servant; though Cromwell 
thought otherwise, serving them diligently for the advance- 
ment of his own purposes. I am now therefore to show you 
their proceedings, 

B. Tell me firs^ how this kind of government under the 
Rump or relic of a House of Commons is to be called? 

A. It is doubtless an oligarchy. For the supreme au- 
thority must needs be in one man or in more. If in one, it 
is monarchy; the Rump therefore was no Monarch.' If the 
authority were in more than one, it was in all, or in fewer 
than all. When in all, it is democracy ; for every man may 
enter into the assembly which makes the Sovereign Court ; 
which they could not do here. It is therefore manifest, 
that the authority was in a few, and consequently the state 
was an oligarchy. 

B. Is it not impossible for a people to be well governed, 
that are to obey more masters than one ? 

A. Both the Rump and all other sovereign assemblies, if 
they have but one voice,, though they be many men, yet are 
they but one person. For contrary commands cannot con- 
sist in one and the same voice, which is the voice of the 
greatest part ; and therefore they might govern well enough, 
if they had honesty and wit enough. 

The first act of the Rump, was the exclusion of those 
members of the House of Commons, which had been 
formerly kept out by violence for the procuring of an ordi- 

' was no monarchy. 



DkiUgMi^ BEHEMOTH. 



nance for the Kin^fk trial; for fbese men had appeared 
against the ordinance of non-addresses, and therefore to be 
excluded, because they might else be an impediment to their 
future designs. 

B. Wasit not rather, because in the authority of few they 
thought the fewer the better, both in respect of thdr shares 
and also of a nearer approach in every one of them to the 
dignity of a King ? 

A. Yes, certainly, that was their principal end. 

B. When these were put out, why did not the oountiet 
and boroughs choose others in their places ? 

A. They could not do that without order from the House. 
After this they constituted a council of forty peraonsi 

which they termed a Council of State, whose office was to 
execute what the Rump should command 

B. AVhen there was neither King nor House of Lordsi 
they could not call themselves a Parliament ; for a Parlia- 
ment is a meeting of the King, Lords, and Commons, to 
confer together about the businesses of the commonwealth. 
With whom did the Rump confer? 

A, Men may give to their assembly what name they please^ 
what signification soever such name might formerly have 
had ; and the Rump took the name of Parliament, as most 
suitable to their purpose, and such a name, as being venerable 
amongst the people, had for many hundred years counte- 
nanced and sweetened subsidies and other levies of money, 
otherwise very unpleasant to the subject They took also 
afterwards another name, which was Custodes Libertatis 
Anglicty which title they used only in their writs issuing out 
of the courts of justice. 

B. I do not see how a subject that is tied to the laws, 
can have more liberty in one form of government than in 
another. 

A. Howsoever, to the people that understand by liberty 
nothing but leave to do what they list, it was a title not 
ingrateful. 

Their next work was to set forth a public declaration. 



SS BEHEMOTH. Diahgiu 4. 

that thej were faDy resolved to nmintain the fundamental 
laws of the nation, as to the preservation of the lives, 
liberties, and proprieties of he people. 

B. What did diey mean by the ftmdamental laws of the 
nation? 

A. Nothing but to abuse the people. For the only 
fundamental law in every commonwealth is to obey the 
laws from time to time, which he shall make to whom the 
people have given the supreme power. How likely then are 
they to uphold the fundamental laws, that had murdered 
htm who was by themselves so often acknowledged for their 
lawful sovereign? Besides, at the same time that this 
declaration came forth, they were erecting that High Court 
of Justice which took away the lives of Duke Hamilton, the 
Earl of Holland, and the Lord CapeL Whatsoever they 
meant by a fundamental law, the erecting of this court was 
a breach of it, as being warranted by no former law or 
example in England. 

At the same time also they levied taxes by soldiers, and 
to soldiers permitted free quarter, and did many other 
actions, which if the King had done, they would have said 
had been done against the liberty and propriety of the 
subject 

JB. What silly things are the common sort of people, to 
be cozened as they were so grossly ! 

A. What sort of people, as to this matter, are not of the 
common sort ? The craftiest knaves of all the Rump were 
no wiser than the rest whom they cozened. For the most 
of them did believe that the same things which they 
imposed upon the generality, were just and reasonable ; and 
especially the great haranguers, and such as pretended to 
learning. For who can be a good subject to monarchy, 
whose principles are taken from the enemies of monarchy, 
such as were Cicero, Seneca, Cato, and other politicians of 
Rome, and Aristotle of Athens, who seldom speak of kings 
but as of wolves and other ravenous beasts? You may 
perhaps think a man has need of nothing else to know the

duty he owei to his governor, and what right he has to 
order hiniy but a good natural wit; bat it is otherwise. For 
it is a science, and built upon sure and clear principles, and 
to be learned by deep and careful study, or from masters 
that have deeply studied it. And who was there in the 
Parliament or in the nation, that could find out those 
evident principles, and derive from them the necessary 
rules of justice, and the necessary connexion of justice and 
peace ? The people have one day in seven the leisure to 
hear instruction, and there are ministers appointed to teach 
them their duty. But how have those ministers performed 
their office ? A great part of them, namely, the Presby- 
terian ministers, throughout the whole war, instigated the 
people against the King; so did also independent and 
other fanatic ministers. The rest, contented with their 
livings, preached in their parishes points of controversy, to 
religion impertinent, but to the breach of charity amongst 
themselves very effectual ; or else elegant things,' which the 
people either understood not, or thought themselves not 
concerned in. But this sort of preachers, as they did little 
good, so they did little hurt The mischief proceeded 
wholly from the Presbyterian preachers, who, by a long 
practbed histrionic faculty, preached up the rebellion power*^ 
fully. 

B. To what end ? 

A. To the end that the State becoming popular, the/ 
Church might be so too, and governed by an Assembly;! 
and by consequence (as they thought) seeing politics are 
subservient to religion, they might govern, and thereby 
satisfy not only their covetous humour with riches, but also 
their malice with power to undo all men that admired not 
their wisdom. Your calling the people silly things, obliged 
me by this digression to show you, that it is not want of 
wit, but want of the science of justice, that brought them 
into these troubles. Persuade, if you can that man that 
has made his fortune, or made it greater, or an eloquent

onitor» or a ravishing poet, or a subtle lawyer, or but a good 
hunter or a cunning gamester, that he has not a good wit ; 
and yet there were of all these a great many so silly, as to 
be deceived by the Rump and *yet were* members of the 
same Rump. They wanted not wit, but the knowledge of 
the causes and grounds upon which one person has a right 
to govern, and the rest an obligation to obey ; which grounds 
are necessary to be taught the people, who without them 
cannot live long in peace amongst themselves. 

B. Let us return, if you please, to the proceedings of the 
Rump. 

A. In the rest of this year they voted a new stamp for 
the coin of this nation. They considered also of agents 
to be sent to foreign states ; and having lately received 
applause from the army for their work done by the High 
Court of Justice, and encouragement to extend the same 
further, they created another High Court ' of Justice, in 
which were tried Duke Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, 
Lord Capel, the Earl of Norwich, and Sir John Owen ; 
whereof, as I mentioned before, the three first were be- 
headed. This affrighted divers of the King's party out of 
the land ; for not only they, but all that had borne arms for 
the King, were at that time in very great danger of their 
lives. For it was put to the question by the army at a 
council of war, whether they should be all massacred or no ; 
where the noes carried it but by two voices. Lastly, March 
the 24th, they put the Mayor of London out of his office, 
fined him 2,000/., disfranchised him, and condemned him to 
two months' imprisonment in the Tower, for refusing to 
proclaim the act for abolishing the kingly power. And thus 
ended the year 1648 and the monthly fa^t; God having] 
granted that which they fasted "^and prayed* for, the deatl 
of the King and the possession of his inheritance. By thesj 
their proceedings they had already lost the hearts of the geni 
rality of the people, and had nothing to trust to but the armv; 
which was not in their power, but in Cromwell's ; who never 

' they perfected the said High Court.

In the beginning of 1649 ^'^ Scots, discontented with 
the proceedings of the Rump against the kite King, began 
to levy soldiers in order to a new invasion of England. The 
Irish rebels, for want of timely resistance from England, 
were grown terrible; and the English army at home^ in. 
fected by the adjutators, were casting how to share the land 
amongst the godly, meaning themselves and such others as 
they pleased, who were therefore called Levellers. Also the 
Rump for the present were not very well provided of money, 
and, therefore, the first thing they did, was the laying of 
a tax upon the people of 90,000/. a month for the main* 
tenance of the army. 

£. Was it not one of their quarrels with the King, that he 
had levied money without the consent of the people in 
Parliament? 

A. You may see by this, what reason the Rump had to 
call itself a Parliament For the taxes imposed by Parlia- 
ment were always understood to be by the people's consent, 
and consequently legal. — ^To appease the Scots, they sent 
messengers with flattering letters to keep them from en- 
gaging for the present King ; but in vain. For they would 
hear nothing from a House of Commons (as they called it) 
at Westminster^ without a King and Lords. But they sent 
commissioners to the King, to let him know what they were 
doing for him : for they had resolved to raise an army of 
17,000 foot and 6,000 horse (for themselves). 

To relieve Ireland, the Rump had resolved to send eleven 
regiments thither out of the army in England. This hap- 
pened well for Cromwell. For the levelling soldiers, which 
were in every regiment many, and in some the major part, 
finding that instead of dividing the land at home they were 
to venture their lives in Ireland, flatly denied to go; and 
one regiment, having cashiered their colonel, about Salisbury,

WIS marching to join with three regiments more of the 
same resolution ; but both the general and Cromwell falling 
upon them at Burford, utterly defeated them, and soon after 
reduced the whole army to their obedience. And thus 
another of the impediments to Cromwell's advancement was 
soon removed. This done, they came to Oxford, and thence 
to London. At Oxford, both the general and Cromwell 
were made doctors of the civil law ; and at London, feasted 
and presented by the city. 

B. Were they not first made masters, and then doctors ? 

A. They made themselves already masters, both of the 
laws and Parliament. The army now being obedient, the 
Rump sent over those eleven regiments into Ireland, under 
the command of Dr. Cromwell, intituled governor of that 
kingdom, the Lord Fairfax being still general of all the 
forces, both here and there. 

The Marquis (now Duke) of Ormond was the King's 
lieutenant of Ireland; and the rebels had made a con- 
federacy amongst themselves ; and these confederates had 
made a kind of league with the lieutenant, wherein they 
agreed, upon liberty given them in the exercise of their 
religion, to be faithful to and assist the King. To these 
also were joined some forces raised by the Earls of Castle- 
haven and Clanricarde and my Lord Inchiquin; so that 
they were the greatest united strength in the island. But 
there were amongst them a great many other Papists, that 
would by no means subject themselves to Protestants ; and 
these were called the Nuntio's party, as the others were 
called the confederate party. These parties not agreeing, 
and the confederate party having broken their articles, the 
lord-lieutenant seeing them ready to besiege him in Dublin, 
and not able to defend it, did, to preserve the place for the 
Protestants, sunender it to the Parliament of England ; and 
came over to the King, at that time when he was carried 
from place to place by the army. From England he went 
over to the Prince (now King), residing then at Paris. 

But the confederates, affrighted with the news that the 



Dial^A. BEHEMOTH. 163 

Ramp was sending over an anny thither, desired tiie Prince 
by lettersi to send back my Lord of Ormond, engaging 
themselves to submit absolutely to the King's authority, 
and to obey my Lord of Ormond as his lieutenant And 
hereupon he was sent back. This was about a year before 
the going over of CromwelL 

In which time, by the dissension in Ireland between the 
confederate party and the Nuntio's party, and discontents 
about command, this otherwise sufficient power effected 
nothing | and was at last defeated, August the and, by a sally 
out of Dublin, which they were besieging. Within a few days 
after arrived Cromwell, who with extraordinary diligence and 
horrid executions, in less than a twelvemonth that he stayed 
there, subdued in a manner the whole nation \ having killed 
or exterminated a great part of them, and leaving his son-in- 
law Ireton to subdue the rest. But Ireton died there (before 
the business ¥ras quite done) of the plague. This was one 
step more towards Cromwell's exaltation to the throne. 

B. What a miserable condition was Ireland reduced to 
by the learning of the Roman, as well as England was by 
the learning of the Presbyterian clergy 1 

A. In the latter end of the preceding year the King was 
come from Paris to the Hague; and shortly after came 
thither from the Rump their agent Dorislaus, doctor of civil 
law, who had been employed in the drawing up of the 
charge against the late King. But the first night be came, 
as he was at supper, a company of cavaliers, near a dozen, 
entered his chamber, killed him, and got away. Not long 
after also their agent at Madrid, one Ascham, one that had 
written in defence of his masters, was killed in the same 
manner. About this time came out two books, one written 
by Salmasius, a Presbyterian, against the murder of the 
King ; another written by Milton, an English Independent, 
in answer to it

two dedtnadoniy/fv and ean^ made for exercise only in a 
rhetoric school t^ one and die same maa So like is a 
Presbyterian to an Independent 

A. In this year the Rump did not much at home ; save 
that in the beginning they made England a Free-State by an 
act which runs thus : *^Be it enacted and dedared by this 
preset^ Parliament^ and by the authority thereof^ that the 
people of En^andf and all the dominions and territories 
thereunto belongings are^ and shall be^ and are hereby con- 
stituted^ made^ and declared a Commonwealth and Free-State^ 

B. What did they mean by a Free-State and common- 
wealth ? Were the people no longer to be subject to laws ? 
They could not mean that : for the Pariiament meant to 
govern them by their own laws, and punish such as broke 
them* Did they mean that England should not be subject 
to any foreign kingdom or commonwealth ? That needed 
not be enacted, seeing there was no king nor people pre- 
tended to be their masters. What did they mean then ? 

A. They meant that neither this king, nor any king, nor 
any single person, but only that they themselves would be 
the people's masters, and would have set it down in those 
plain words, if the people could have been cozened with 
words intelligible, as easily as with words not intelligible. 

After this they gave one another money and estates, out 
of the lands and goods of the loyal party. They enacted 
also an engagement to be taken by every man, in these 
words: You shall promise to be true and faithful to the 
Commonwealth of England^ as it is now established^ without 
King or House of Lords, 

They banished also from within twenty miles of London 
all the royal party, forbidding also every one of them to 
depart more than five miles from his dwelling-house. 

B, They meant perhaps to have them ready, if need 
were, for a massacre. But what did the Scots in this time ? 

A» They were considering the army which they were 
levying for the King, how they might exclude from com-

mand til such ai had loyaDy served his fiitheri and all In- 
dependents! and all such as had command in Duke Hamil- 
ton's army; and these were the main things that passed 
this year. 

The Marquis of Montrose^ that in the year 1645 had with 
a few men, and in little time^ done things almost incredible 
against the late Kong's enemies in Scotland, landed now 
again, in the beginning of the year 1650, in the north of 
Scotland, with commission from the present King, hoping 
to do him as good service as he had formerly done his 
father. But the case was altered; for the Scotch forces 
were then in England in the service of the Parliament; 
whereas now they were in Scotland, and many more (for 
their intended invasion) newly raised. Besides, the soldiers 
which the Marquis brought over were few, and foreigners; 
nor did the Highlanders come in to him, as he expected; 
insomuch as he was soon defeated, and shortly after taken, 
and (with more spiteful usage than revenge required) 
executed by the Covenanters of Edinburgh, May the and. 

B, What good could the King expect from joining with 
these men, who during the treaty discovered so much malice 
to him in one of his best servants ? 

A. No doubt (their churchmen being then prevalent) they 
would have done as much to this King as the English Par- 
liament had done to his father, if they could have gotten 
by it that which they foolishly aspired to, the government of 
the nation. Do not believe that the Independents were 
worse than the Presbyterians : both the one and the other 
were resolved to destroy whatsoever should stand in the way 
to their ambition. But necessity made the King pass over 
both this and many other indignities from them, rather than 
suffer the pursuit of his right in England to cool, and be 
little better than extinguished 

B, Indeed I believe, a kingdom, if suffered to become an 
old debt, will hardly ever be recovered Besides, the King . 
was sure, wheresoever the victory lighted, he could lose 
nothing in the war but enemies. 



^^ BEHEMOTH. DUdogiui^ 

A. About the time of Montrose's death, which was in 
May, Cromwell was yet in Ireland, and his work unfinished 
But finding, or by his fiiends advertised, that h*is presence 
in the expedition now preparing against the Scots would be 
necessary to his design, he sent to the Rump to know their 
pleasure concerning his return. But for all that, he knew, 
or thought it was not necessary to stay for their answer, but 
came away, and arrived at London the 6th of June follow- 
ing, and was welcomed by the Rump. Now General Fair- 
fax, who was truly what he pretended to be, a Presbyterian, 
had been so catechised by the Presbyterian mimsters here, 
that he refused to fight against the brethren in Scotland ; 
nor did the Rump nor Cromwell go about to rectify his con- 
science in that point And thus Fairfax laying down his 
commission, Cromwell was now made general of all the 
forces in England and Ireland; which was another step 
to the sovereign power. '*' And there appeared but one more, 
which was the mastering of Scotland. Towards which he 
began to march June the 12th, and came to Barwick July 
the 21st, his army being, horse and foot, 16,000.'*' 

B. Where was the King ? 

A. In Scotland, newly come over. He landed in the 
north, and was honourably conducted to Edinburgh, though 
all things were not yet well agreed on between the Scots and 
him. For though he had yielded to as hard conditions as 
the late King had yielded to in the Isle of Wight, yet they 
had still somewhat to add, till the King, enduring no more, 
departed from them towards the north again. But they sent 
messengers after him to pray him to return, but they furnished 
these messengers with strength enough to bring him back, if 
he should have refused. In fine they agreed; but ♦they* 
would not suffer either the King, or any royalist, to have com- 
mand in the army. 

B* The sum of all is, the King was there a prisoner. 

A. Cromwell from Barwick sends a declaration to the 
Scots, telling them he had no quarrel against the people 
of Scotland, but against a malignant party that had 



DiakpuA^ BEHEMOTH. 167 

brought i n the Kbg^ to the disturbance of the peace betireen 
the two nations; and that he was willing, either by conference 
to give and receive satisfiiction, or to decide the justice of 
the cause by battle. To which the Scots answering, declare: 
that they will not prosecute the King's interest before and 
and without his acknowledgment of the sins of his house, 
and his former ways, and satisfaction given to God's people 
in both kingdoms. Judge by this whether the present King 
were not in as bad a condition here, as his father was in the 
hands of the Presbyterians of England. 

B. Presbyterians are everywhere the same: they would 
fain be absolute governors of all they converse with, having 
nothing to plead for it, but that where they reign, it is 
God that reigns, and nowhere else. But I observe one 
strange dem<ind, that the King should acknowledge the sins 
of his house ; for I thought it had been certainly held by all 
divines, that no man was bound to acknowledge any man's 
sins but his own. 

A. The King having yielded to all that the Church re- 
quired, the Scots proceeded in their intended war. Cromwell 
marched on to Edinburgh, provoking them all he could to 
battle ; which they declining, and provisions growing scarce 
in the English army, Cromwell retired to Dunbar, despairing 
of success ; and intending by sea or land to get back into 
England. And such was the condition which this General 
(Cromwell), so much magnified for conduct, had brought his 
army to, that all his glories had ended in shame and punish- 
ment, if fortune and the faults of his enemies had not re- 
lieved him. For as he retired, the Scots followed him close 
all the way till within a mile of Dunbar. There is a ridge 
of hills, that from beyond Edinburgh goes winding to the 
sea, and crosses the highway between Dunbar and Berwick, 
at a village called Copperspeith, where the passage is so 
difficult, that had the Scots sent timely thither a very few 
men to guard it, the English could never have gotten home. 
For the Scots kept the hills, and needed not have fought 
but upon great advantage, and were almost two to one* 



BEHEMOTH. biaUgm 4- 

Cromwell's anny was at the foot of those hillsi on the north 
side; and there was a great ditch or channel of a torrent 
between the hills and it ; so that he could never have got 
home by land, nor without utter ruin of the army attempted 
to ship it] nor have stayed where he was, for want of pro- 
visions. Now Cromwell knowing the pass was free, and 
commanding a good party of horse and foot to possess it, it 
was necessary for the Scots to let them go, whom they 
bragged they had impounded, or else to fight; and therefore 
with the best of their horse charged the English, and 
made them at first to shrink a little. But the English foot 
coming on, the Scots were put to flight ; and the flight of 
the horse hindered the foot from engaging ; who therefore 
fled, as did also the rest of their horse. Thus the folly of 
the Scottish commanders brought all their odds to an even 
lay between two small and equal parties ; wherein fortune 
gave the victory to the English, who were not many more 
in number than those that were killed and taken prisoners 
of the Scots ; and the Church lost their cannon, bag and 
baggage, with 10,000 arms, and almost their whole army. 
The rest were got together by Lesley to Stirling. 

B, This victory happened well for the King. For had 
the Scots been victors, the Presbyterians, both there and 
here, would have domineered again, and the King been in 
the same condition his father was in at Newcastle, in the 
hands of the Scottish army. For in pursuit of this victory, 
the English at last brought the Scots to a pretty good habit 
of obedience for the King, whensoever he should recover 
his right 

A. In pursuit of this victory the English marched to 
Edinburgh (quitted by the Scots), fortified Leith, and took 
in all the strength and castles they thought fit on this side 
the Frith, which now was become the bound betwixt the 
two nations. And the Scotch ecclesiastics began to know 
themselves better ; and resolved in their new army, which 
they meant to raise, to admit some of the royalists into com- 
mand. Cromwell from Edinburgh marched towards Stirling, 



DUUgm^^ BEHEMOTH. 

to provoke the enemy to fight, but finding danger in it 
returned to Edinbuigh, and b^eged the castle. In the 
meantime he sent a party into the west of Scotland to 
suppress Strachan and Kerr, two great Presbyterians that 
were there levying of forces for their new army. And in the 
same time the Scots crowned the King at Scone^ 

The rest of this year was spent in Scotland, on CromwdTs 
part, in taking of Edinburgh Castle and in attempts to pass 
the Frith, or any other ways to get over to the Scottish 
forces ; and on the Scots' part^ in hastening their levies firom 
the North. 

B. AVhat did the Rump at home during this time? 

A. They voted liberty of conscience to the sectaries; 
that is, they plucked out the sting of Presbytery, which con- 
sisted in a severe imposing of odd opinions upon the people, 
impertinent to religion, but conducing to the advancement of 
the power of the Presbyterian ministers. Also they levied 
more soldiers, and gave the command of them to Harrison, 
now made major-general, a Fifth-monarchy-man; and of 
these soldiers two regiments of horse and one of foot were 
raised by the Fifth-monarchy-men and other sectaries, in 
thankfulness for this their liberty from the Presbyterian 
tyranny. Also they pulled down the late King's statue in 
the Exchange, and in the niche where it stood, caused to be 
written these words : Exit fyrannus^ Regum ultmus^ etc. 

B. What good did that do them, and why did they not 
pull down the statues of all the rest of the Kings? 

A. AVhat account can be given of actions that proceed 
not from reason, but spite and such-like passions ? Besides 
this, they received ambassadors from Portugal and from 
Spain, acknowledging their power. And in the very end of 
the year they prepared ambassadors to the Netherlands to 
offer them friendship. All they did besides, vras persecuting 
and executing of royalists. 

In the beginning of the year 165 1 General Dean arrived in 
Scotland; and on the nth of April the Scottish Pariiament 
assembled, and made certain acts in order 10 a better uniting 



BEHEMOTH. , Diakpu^ 

of themsdvesi and better obedience to the King, who was 
now at Stirling with the Scottish forces he had, expecting 
more now in levying^ Cromwell from Edinburgh went 
divers times towards Stirling to provoke the Scots to fight. 
There was no ford there to pass over his men ; at last boats 
being come from London and Newcastle, Colonel Overton 
(though it were long first, for it vras now July) transported 
1,400 foot of his own, besides another regiment of foot and 
four troops of horse, and entrenched himself at Northferry 
on the other side; and before any help could come from 
Stirling, Major-General Lambert also was got over with as 
many more. By this time Sir John Browne was come to 
oppose them with 4,500 men, whom the English there de- 
feated, killing about 2,000 and taking prisoners 1,600. This 
done, and as much more of the army transported as was * 
thought fit, Cromwell comes before St Johnstone's (from 
whence the Scottish Parliament, upon th^ news of his pass- 
ing the Frith, was removed to Dundee) and summons it ; 
and the same day had news brought him, that the King was 
marching from Stirling towards England ; which was true. 
But notwithstanding the King was three days' march before 
him, he resolved to have the town before he followed him ; 
and accordingly had it the next day by surrender. 

B* What hopes had the King in coming into England, 
having before and behind him none, at least none armed, 
but his enemies ? 

A. Yes ; there was before him the city of London, which 
generally hated the Rump, and might reasonably be reckoned 
for 20,000 well-armed soldiers; and most men believed they 
would take his part, had he come near to the city. 

B. What probability was there of that ? Do you think 
the Rump was not sure of the service of the mayor, and 
those that had command of the city militia f And if they 
had been really the King's friends, what need had they to 
stay for his coming up to London? They might have seized 
the Rump, if they had pleased, which had no possibility of 
defending themselves; at least they might have turned them 
out of the House. 



DMtguiA. BEHEMOTH. Vfi 



A. This thejrdid not; bot» on the oontnuy, permitted the 
recruiting of Cromwell's army, and the raising of men to 
keep the country from coining in to the King. The King 
began his march from Stirling the last of July, and August 
the asnd came to Worcester by way of Carlisle with a 
weary army of about 13,000, whom Cromwell followed, and 
joining with the new levies environed Worcester with 40^000, 
and on the 3rd of September utterly defeated the King's 
army. Here Duke Hamilton, brother of him that was be- 
headed, was slaia 

B. What became of the King? 

A. Night commg on, before the dty was quite taken he 
left it ; it being dark, and none of the enemy's horse within 
the town to follow him, the plundering foot having kept the 
gates shut, lest the horse should enter and have a share of 
the booty. The King before morning got into Warwickshire^ 
twenty-five miles from Worcester, and there lay disguised 
awhile, and afterwards went up and down in great danger of 
being discovered, till at last he got over into France, from 
Bright-Hempsted in Sussex 

B. When Cromwell was gone, what was further done in 
Scotland ? 

A. Lieutenant-General Monk, whom Cromwell left there 
with 7,000, took Stirling August 14th by surrender, and 
Dundee the 3rd of September, by storm, because it resisted. 
This the soldiers plundered, and had good booty, because 
the Scots for safety had sent thither their most precious 
goods from Edinburgh and St Johnstone's. He took like- 
wise by sunender Aberdeen and (the place where the Scottish 
ministers first learned to play the fools) St Andrew's. Also 
in the Highlands, Colonel Alured took a knot of lords and 
gentlemen, viz., four earls and four lords and above twenty 
knights and gentlemen, whom he sent prisoners into England. 
So that there was nothing more to be feared from Scotland : 
all the trouble of the Rump being to resolve what they 
should do with it At last they resolved to unite and incor- 
porate it into one commonwealth with England and Ireland. 



179 BEHEMOTH. DialogHH^ 

And to that end sent thither St Johnii Vane, and other 
commisnonersi to offer them this union by public decla- 
ration, and to warn them to choose their deputies of shires 
and burgesses of towns, and send them to Westminster. 
B. This was a veiy great favour. 

A. I think so: and yet it was by many of the Scots, 
espedaUy by the ministers and other Presbyterians, refused. 
The ministers had given way to the levying of money for 
the payment of the English soldiers ; but to comply with 
the declaration of the English commissioners they absolutely 
forbad. 

B. Methinks, this contributing to the pay of their con- 
querors was some mark of servitude ; whereas entering into 
the union made them free, and gave them equal privilege 
with the English. 

A. The cause why they refused the union, rendered by 
the Presbyterian '''ministers* themselves, was this: that it 
drew with it a subordination of the Church to the civil state 
in the things of Christ 

B. This is a downright declaration to all kings and 
commonwealths in general : that a Presbyterian minister will 
be a true subject to none of them in the things of Christ; 
which things what they are, they will be judges themselves. 
What have we then gotten by our deliverance from the 
Pope's tyranny, if these petty men succeed in the place of 
it, that have nothing in them that can be beneficial to the 
public, except their silence ? For their learning, it amounts 
to no more than an imperfect knowledge of Greek and 
Latin, and an acquired readiness in the Scripture language, 
with a gesture and tone suitable thereunto ; but of justice 
and charity (the marrow of religion*) they have neither 
knowledge nor practice, as is manifest by the stories I have 
already told you. Nor do they distinguish between the 
godly and the ungodly but by conformity of design in men 
of judgment, or by repetition of their sermons in the common 
sort of people.

of merchandife in other than Eng^h ships. The English 
also molested their fishing upon our coast They also many 
times searched their ships (upon occasion of our war with 
FranceX and rbade some of them prize. And then the 
Dutch sent their ambassadors hither to desire what they 
before refused ; but partly also to inform themselves what 
naval forces the English had ready» and how the people 
here were contented with the government 

£. How sped they? 

A. The Rump showed now as little desire of agreement 
as the Dutch did then ; standing upon terms never likely 
to be granted. First, for the fishing on the English coast, 
that they should not have it without paying for it Secondly, 
that the English should have free trade firom Middleburgh 
to Antwerp, as they had before their rebellion against the 
King of Spain. Thirdly, they demanded amends for the 
old (but never to be forgotten) business of Amboyna. So 
that the war was already certain, though the season kept 
them from action till the spring following. The true quanel, 
on the English part, was that their proffered friendship was 
scorned, and their ambassadors affronted; on the Dutch 
part, was the greediness to engross all traffic, and a false 
estimate of our and their own strength. 

Whilst these things were doing, the relics of the war, both 
in Ireland and Scotland, were not neglected, though those 
nations were not fully pacified till two years after. The 
persecution also of royalists was continued, amongst whom 
was beheaded one Mr. Love, for holding correspondence 
with the King. 

£. I had thought a Presbyterian minister, whilst he was 
such, could not be a royalist, because they think their 
assembly have the supreme power in the things of Christ ; 
and by consequence they are in England (by a statute) 
traitors. 

A. You may think so still : for though I called Mr. Love 
a royalist, I meant it only for that one act for which he was 
condemned. It was he who during the treaty at Uxbridge^

preaching before the commissionen there, nid ; it was as 
possible for heaven end hell, as for the' King and Parliament, 
to agree. Both he and the rest of the Presbyterians are and 
were enemies to the King's enemies, Cromwell and his 
fanatics, for their own, not for the King's sake. Their 
loyalty was like that of Sir John Hotham's, that kept the 
King out of Hull, and afterward:! would have betrayed the 
same to the Marquis of New-'*'- tt.— « ^esbyterians

Tliis year also were reduced to th( ce of the Rump 

the islands of Scilty and Man, and iiadoes, and St 

Christopher's. One thing feU out thai f liked not, which 
was, that Cromwell gave them warning to de ermine their 
sitting, according to the bill for triennial Parliaments. 
B. That I think indeed was harsh. 
A. In the year 1652, May the 14th, began the Dutch 
war, in this manner. Three Dutch men-of-war, with divers 
merchants from the straights, being discovered by one 
Captain Young, who commanded some English frigates, 
the said Young sent to their admiral to bid him strike his 
flag (a thing usually done in acknowledgment of the English 
dominion in the narrow seas) ; which accordingly he did. 
Then came up the vice-admiral, and being called to (as the 
other was) to take down his flag, he answered plainly he 
would not : but after the exchange of four or five broadsides, 
and mischief done on either part, he took it down. But 
Captain Young demanded also, either the vice-admiral him- 
self, or his ship, to make good the damage already sustained; 
to which the vice-admiral answered that he had taken in his 
ll.ig, but would defend himself and his ship. Whereupon 
0>i>laiii Young consulting with the captains of his other 
ships, lest the beginning of the war in this time of treaty 
should be charged upon himself, and night also coming on, 
thought fit to proceed no further. 

~ ~ •aj ily began at this time. But who began it? 



176 BEHEMOTH. \DUdogHi^ 

A. The dominion of the seas belonging to the English, 
there can be no question but the Dutch began it : and that 
the said dominion belonged to the English^ it was confessed, 
at first by the admiral himself peaceably, and at last by the 
vice-admiral, taking in their flags. 

About a fortnight after there happened another fight, upon 
the like occasion. Van Tromp, with forty-two men-of-war, 
came to the back of Goodwin Sands (Major Bourne being 
then with a few of the Parliaments ships in the Downs, and 
Blake with the rest further westward), and sent two captains 
of his to Bourne, to excuse his coming thither. To whom 
Bourne returned this answer, that the message was civil, but 
that it might appear real, he ought to depart So Tromp 
departed, meaning (now Bourne was satisfied) to sail towards 
Blake, and he did so ; but so did also Bourne, for fear of 
the worst When Tromp and Blake were near one another, 
Blake made a shot over Tromp's ship, as a warning to him 
to take in his flag. This he did thrice, and then Tromp 
gave him a broadside ; and so began the fight (at the begin- 
ning whereof Bourne came in), and lasted from two o'clock 
till night, the English having the better, and the flag, as 
before, making the quarrel 

B. What needs there, when both nations were heartily 
resolved to fight, to stand so much upon this compliment 
of who should begin? For as to the gaining of friends and 
confederates thereby, I think it was in vain ; seeing princes 
and states in such occasions look not much upon the justice 
of their neighbours, but upon their own concernment in the 
event 

A* It is commonly so ; but in this case, the Dutch know- 
ing the dominion of the narrow seas to be a gallant title, 
and envied by all the nations that reach the shore, and 
consequently that they were likely to oppose it, did wisely 
enough in making this point the state of the quarrel. — After 
this fight the Dutch ambassadors residing in England sent 
a paper to the council of state, wherein they styled this last 
encounter a rash action^ and aflirmed it was done without 



DUhgm^. BEHEMOTH. 

the knowledge and against the will of their locds the Statei- 
generaly and desired them that nothing mig^t be done upon 
it in heat, which might become irreparable. The Parlia- 
ment hereupon voted : i. That the States-general should 
pay the charges they were at, and for the damages they 
sustained upon this occasion, a. That this being paid, 
there should be a cessation of all acts of hostility, and a 
mutual restitution of all ships and goods taken. 3. And 
both these agreed to, that there should be made a league 
between the two commonwealths. These votes were sent 
to the Dutch ambassadors in answer of their said paper; 
but with a preamble setting forth the former kindnesses of 
England to the Netherlands, and taking notice of their new 
fleet of 150 men-of-war, without any other apparent design 
than the destruction of the English fleet. 

B. What answer made the Dutch to this? 

A. None. Tromp sailed presently to Zealand, and 
Blake with seventy men-of-war to the Orkney Islands, to 
seize their busses, and to wait for Ave Dutch ships from the 
East Indies. And Sir George Askew, newly returned from 
the Barbadoes, came into the Downs with fifteen men-of- 
war, where he was commanded to stay for a recruit out of 
the Thames. 

Van Tromp being recruited now to 120 sail, made 
account to get in between Sir George Askew and the mouth 
of the river, but was hindered so long by contrary winds, 
that the merchants calling for his convoy he could stay no 
longer ; and so he went back into Holland, and thence to 
Orkney, where he met with the said five East India ships 
and sent them home. And then he endeavoured to engage 
with Blake, but a sudden storm forced him to sea, and so 
dissipated his fleet that only forty-two came home in body, 
the rest singly as well as they could Blake also came home, 
but went first to the coast of Holland with 900 prisoners 
and six men-of-war taken, which were part of twelve which 
he found and took guarding their busses. This was the 
first bout after the war declared. 



BEHEMOTH. Diahf^ 4- 

In August following there happened a fight between De 
Ruyter, the admiral of Zealand with fifty men-of-war, and 
Sir George Askew, near Plymouth, with forty, wherein Sir 
George had the better, and might have got an entire victory 
had the whole fleet engaged. Whatsoever was the matter, 
the Rump (though they rewaixled him), never more employed 
him after his return in their service at sea : but voted for 
the year to come three generals, Blake that was one already, 
and Dean, and Monk. 

About this time the Archduke Leopold besieging Dun- 
kirk, and the French sending a fleet to relieve it. General 
Blake lighting on the French at Calais, and taking seven of 
their ships, was cause of the town's surrender. 

In September they fought again, De Witt and De Ruyter 
commanding the Dutch, and Blake the English ; and the 
Dutch were again worsted. 

Again, in the end of November, Van Tromp with eighty 
men-of-war showed himself at the back of Goodwin Sands ; 
where Blake, though he had with him but forty, adventured 
to fight with him, and had much the worst, and (night parting 
the fray) retired into the river of Thames ; whilst Van Tromp 
keeping the sea, took some inconsiderable vessels from the 
English, and thereupon (as it was said) with a childish vanity 
hung out a broom from his main-top-mast, signifying he 
meant to sweep the seas of all English shipping. 

After this, in February, the Dutch with Van Tromp were 
encountered by the English under Blake and Dean near 
Portsmouth, and had the worst And these were all the 
encounters between them in this year in the narrow seas. 
They fought also once at Leghorn, where the Dutch had 
the better. 

i9. I see no great odds yet on either side ; if there were 
any, the English had it 

A. Nor did either of them ere the more incline to peace.

Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and the Hanse Towns (whence

Parliament House, and dissolved them, turning them out, 
and locked up the doors. And for this action he was more 
applauded by the people than for any of his victories in the 
war, and the Parliament men as much scorned and derided 
B. Now that there was no Parliament, who had the 
supreme power ? 

A. If by power you mean the right to govern, nobody 
'''here'*' had it If you mean the supreme strength, it was 
clearly in Cromwell, who was obeyed as general of all the 
forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland. 

B. Did he pretend that for title ? 

A. No : but presently after he invented a title, which was 
this : that he was necessitated for the defence of the cause, 
for which at first the Parliament had taken up arms (that is 
to say, rebelled), to have recourse to extraordinary actions. 
You know the pretence of the Long Parliament's rebellion 
was saluspopuli^ the safety of the nation against a dangerous 
conspiracy of Papists and a malignant party at home ; and 
that every man is bound, as far as his power extends, to 
procure the safety of the whole nation (which none but the 
army were able to do, and the Parliament had hitherto 
neglected); was it not then the general's duty to do it? 
Had he not therefore right ? For that law of salus popuH 
is directed only to those that have power enough to de- 
fend the people; that is, to them that have the supreme 
power. 

B, Yes, certainly, he had as good a title as the Long 
Parliament. But the Long Parliament did represent the 
people; and it seems to me that the sovereign power is 
essentially annexed to the representative of the people. 

A. Yes, if he that makes a representative, that is (in the 
present case) the King, do call them together to receive the 
sovereign power, and he divest himself thereof; otherwise 
not. Nor was ever the Lower House of Parliament the 
representative of the whole nation, but of the commons 
only ; nor had that House the power to oblige, by their acts 
or ordinances, any lord or any priest. 






Diai^puA^ BEHEMOTH. 

B. Did Cromwdl come io upon the only titk of talus 
pofulif 

A. Na For this is a title that veiy few men understand- 
His way was to get the supreme power conferred upon him 
by Parliament Therefore he called a Parliament, and gave 
it the supreme power, with condition that they should give 
it to him.> Was not this witty ? First, therefore, he pub- 
lished a declaration of the causes why he dissolved the 
Parliament The sum whereof was: that instead of en- 
deavouring to promote the good of God's people, they 
endeavoured, by a bill then ready to pass, to recruit the 
House and perpetuate their own power. Next he consti* 
tuted a council of state of his own creatures, to be the 
supreme authority of England ; but no longer than till the 
next Parliament should be called and met. Thirdly, he 
summoned 142 persons, such as he himself or his trusty 
officers made choice of; the greatest part of whom were 
instructed what to do ; obscure persons, and most of them 
fanatics, though styled by Cromwell men of approved fidelity 
and honesty. To these the council of state surrendered the 
supreme authority, and not long after diese men surren- 
dered it to Cromwell. July the 4th this Parliament met, 
and chose for their Speaker one Mr. Rous, and called them- 
selves from that time forward the Parliament of England. 
But Cromwell, for the more surety, constituted also a 
council of state : not of such petty fellows as most of these 
were, but of himself and his principal officers. These did 
all the business, both public and private; making ordinances, 
and giving audiences to foreign ambassadors. But he had 
now more enemies than before. Harrison, who was the 
head of the Fifth-monarchy-men, laying down his commis- 
sion, did nothing but animate his party against him; for 
which afterwards he was imprisoned. This little Parliament 
in the meantime were making ol acts so ridiculous and dis- 
pleasing to the people, that it wo5 thought he chose them 
on purpose to bring all ruling Parliaments into contempt, 
and monarchy again into credit 

' power, to the end • % % lo\am«c:&isu

B. What acts were those? 

A. One of them was, that all marriages should be made 
by a justice of peace, and the banns asked three several 
days in the next market : none were forbidden to be mar- 
ried by a minister, but without a justice of peace the mar- 

oriage was to be void : so that divers wary couples (to be sure 
of one another, howsoever they might repent it afterwards) 
were married both ways. Also they abrogated the engage- 
ment, whereby no man was admitted to sue in any court of 
law that had not taken it, that is, that had not acknowledged 
the late Rump. 

B. Neither of these did any hurt to Cromwell. 

A. They were also in hand with an act to cancel all the 
present laws and law-books, and to make a new code more 
suitable to the humour of the Fifth-monarchy-men ; of whom 
there were many in this Parliament. Their tenet being, 
that there ought none to be sovereign but King Jesus, nor 
any to govern under him but the saints. But their authority 
ended before the act passed 

B. What was this to Cromwell ? 

A. Nothing yet. But they were likewise upon an act, 
now almost ready for the question, that Parliaments hence- 
forward, one upon the end of another, should be perpetual 

B. I understand not this ; unless Parliaments can beget 
one another like animals, or like the phoenix. 

A. Why not like the phoenix? Cannot a Parliament at 
the day of their expiration send out writs for a new one? 

B. Do you think they would not rather summon them- 
selves anew; and to save the labour of coming again to 
Westminster, sit still where they were ? Or if they sum- 
mon the country to make new elections, and then dissolve 
themselves, by what authority shall the people meet in their 
county courts, there being no supreme authority standing? 

A* All they did was absurd, though they knew not that ; 
no nor ""that this would offend Cromwell,"" whose design upon 
the sovereignty' the contriver of this act (it seems) perceived 

* No, nor this, whose design was upon the sovereignty.

noty but Cromwell's portj in the House saw ft wdl enoo^ 
And therefore (as it was laid) there stood up one of the 
members and made a motion, that since the commonwealth 
was like to receive little benefit by their sittings they 
should dissolve themselves. Harrison and they of his sect 
were troubled hereat, and made speeches against it ; but 
Cromwell's party, of whom the speaker was one, left the 
House, and with the mace before them went to Whitehall, 
and surrendered their power to Cromwell that had given it 
to them. And so he got the sovereignty by an act of Par- 
liament; and within four days after, December the i6th, 
was installed Protector of the three nations, and took his 
oath to observe certain rules of govermng, engrossed in 
parchment and read before him. This writing was called 
the instrument. 
B. What were the rules which he swore to ? 

A, One was, to call a Parliament every third year, of 
which the first was to begin September the 3rd following. 

B. I believe he was a little superstitious in the choice of 
September the 3rd, because it was lucky to him in 1650 and 
165 1, at Dunbar and Worcester. 

A. But he knew not how lucky the same would be to the 
whole nation in 1658 at Whitehall 

Another was, that no Parliament should be dissolved till 
it had sitten five months; and that those bills which they 
presented to him, should be passed by him within twenty 
days, or else they should pass without him. 

A third, that he should have a council of state of not 
above twenty-one, nor under thirteen ; and that upon the 
Protector's death this council should meet, and before they 
parted choose a new Protector. There were many more 
besides, but not necessary to be inserted. 

B. How went on the war against the Dutch ? 

A, The generals for the English were Blake, and Dean, 
and Monk ; and Van Tromp for the Dutch ; between whom 
was a battle fought the 2nd of June (which was a month 
before the beginning of this little Parliament), wherein the 



i84 BEHEMOTH. DUlogui^. 

English had the victory, and drove the enemies into their 
harbours, but with the loss of General Dean, slain by a 
cannon-shot This victory was great enough to make the 
Dutch send over ambassadors into England, in order to a. 
. treaty; but in the meantime they prepared and put to sea 
another fleet, which likewise, in the end of July, was de- 
feated by General Monk, who got now a greater victory than 
before ; and this made the Dutch descend so far as to buy 
their peace with the payment of the charge of the v/ar, and 
with the acknowledgment, amongst other articles, that the 
English had the right of the flag. 

This peace was concluded in March, being the end of 
this year, but not proclaimed till April ; the money, it seems, 
being not paid till then. 

The Dutch war being now ended, the Protector sent his 
youngest son Henry into Ireland, whom also some time 
afler he made lieutenant there ; and sent Monk lieutenant- 
general into Scotland, to keep those nations in obedience. 
Nothing else worth remembering was done this year at 
home ; saving the discovery of a plot of royalists, as was 
said, upon the life of the Protector, who all this while had 
intelligence of the King's designs from a traitor in his court, 
who afterwards was taken in the manner and killed. 

B. How came he into so much trust with the King? 

A. He was the son of a colonel that was slain in the 
wars on the late King's side. Besides, he pretended em- 
ployment from the King's loyal and loving subjects here, to 
convey to his Majesty such moneys as they from time to time 
should send him; and to make this credible, Cromwell 
himself caused money to be sent him. 

The following year, 1654, had nothing *in it* of war, but 
was spent in civil ordinances, in appointing of judges, prevent- 
ing of plots (for usurpers are jealous), and in executing the 
King's friends and selling their lands. The 3rd of Sep- 
tember, according to the instrument, the Parliament met ; 
in which there was no House of Lords, and the House of 
Commons was made, as formerly, of knights and burgesses; 



DM^gMi^ BEHEMOTH. 185 

but not as formeriyy of two buigesies for a borough and 
two knights for a county; for boroughs for the most part 
had but one buigessi and some counties six or seven knights. 
Besides, there were twenty members fi>r Scotland, and as 
many for Ireland. So that Cromwell had now nothing else 
to do but to show his art of government upon six coach* 
horses newly presented him, which, being as rebellious 
as himself, threw him out of the coach-box and almost killed 
him. 

B. This Parliament, which had seen how Cromwell had 
handled the two former, the long one and the short one, 
had surely learned the wit to behave themselves better to 
' him than those had done ? 

A, Yes, especially now that Cromwell in his speech at 
their first meeting had expressly forbidden them to meddle 
either with the government by a single person and Parlia- 
ment, or with the militia, or with perpetuating of Parlia-^ 
ments, or taking away liberty of conscience; and told them 
also that every member of the House, before they sat, must 
take a recognition of his power in divers points. Where- 
upon, of above 400 there appeared not above soo at first; 
though afterwards (some relenting) there sat above 300. 
Again, just at their sitting down he published some ordi- 
nances of his own, bearing date before their meeting ; that 
they might see he took his own acts to be as valid as theirs. 
But all this could not make them know themselves. They 
proceeded to the debate of every article of the recognition. 

B. They should have debated that before they had taken 
it. 

A, But then they had never been suffered to sit Crom- 
well being informed of their stubborn proceedings, and out 
of hope of any supply from them, dissolved them. 

All that passed besides in this year was the exercise of 
the High Court of Justice upon some royalists for plots. 

In the year 1655 the English, to the number of near 
10,000, landed in Hispaniola, in hope of the plunder of the 
gold and silver, whereof they thought there was great 



i86 BEHEMOTH. DiaUxui^ 

abundance in the town of Santo Domingo ; but were well 
beaten by a few Spaniards, and with the loss of near x,ooo 
men, went off to Jamaica and possessed it 

This year also the royal party made another attempt in 
the west ; and proclaimed there King Charles the Second ; 
but few joining with them, and some falling off, they were 
soon suppressed, and many of the principal persons exe- 
cuted 

B. In these many insurrections, the royalists, though they 
meant well, yet they did but disservice to the King by their 
impatience. What hope had they to prevail against so great 
an army as the Protector had icady? What cause was 
there to despair of seeing the King's business done better 
by the dissension and ambition of the great commanders in 
that army, whereof many had the favour to be as well 
esteemed amongst them as Cromwell himself? 

A. That was somewhat uncertain. The Protector, being 
frustrated of his hope of money at Santo Domingo, resolved 
to take from the royalists the tenth part yearly of their 
estates. And to this end chiefly, he divided England into 
eleven major-generalships, with commission to every major- 
general to make a roll of the names of all suspected persons 
of the King's party,' and of their estates within his precinct; 
as also to take caution from them, not to act against the 
state, and to reveal all plots that should come to their know- 
ledge ; and to make them engage the like for their servants. 
They had commission also to forbid horse-races and con- 
course of people, and to receive and account for ""the money 
rising from"' this decimation. 

B, By this the usurper might easily inform himself of the 
value of all the estates in England, and of the behaviour 
and affection of every person of quality ; which has hereto- 
fore been taken for very great tyranny. 

A. The year 1656 was a Parliament-year by the instru- 
ment Between the beginning of this year and the day of 
the Parliament's sitting, which was September 17, these

WIS the awing of elections, and making themselves and 
whom they pleased to be returned members for the Parlia- 
ment; which was also thought a part of Cromwell's design 
in their constitution : for he had need of a giving Pariia- 
menty having latelyi upon a peace made with the French, 
drawn upon himself a war with Spain. 

This year it was that Captam Stainer set upon the Spanish 
Plate-fleet, being eight in number, near Cadiz; whereof he 
sunk two, and took two, there bemg in one of them two 
millions of pieces of eight, which amounts to 4oo,oooil 
sterling. 

This year also it was that James Naylor appeared at 
Bristol, and would be taken for Jesus Christ He wore hb 
beard forked, and his hair composed to the likeness of that 
in the VoUo Santo; and being questioned, would some- 
times answer. Thou sayest it He had also his disciples, 
that would go by his horse side, to the mid-leg in dirt 
Being sent for by the Parliament he was sentenced to stand 
on the pillory, to have his tongue bored through, and to be 
marked on the forehead with the letter B, for blasphemy, 
and to remain in Bridewell Lambert, a great £ivourite of 
the army, endeavoured to save him, partly because he had 
been his soldier, and partly to curry favour with the sec- 
taries of the army ; for he was now no more in the Pro- 
tector's favour, but meditating how he might succeed him 
in his power. 

About two years before this, there appeared in Cornwall 
a prophetess, much famed for her dreams and visions, and 
hearkened to by many, whereof some were eminent officers. 
But she and some of her accomplices being imprisoned, we 
heard no more of her. 

B. I have heard of another, one Lilly, that prophesied all 
the time of the Long Parliament What did they to him ? 

.A. His prophecies were of another kind ; he was a writer 
of almanacs, and a pretender to a pretended art of judicial 



BEHEMOTH. Diahgui \. 

astrology ; a mere oojsenefi to get maintenance from a mul- 
titude of ignorant people ; and no doubt had been called 
in question, if his prophecies had been any way disadvan- 
tageous to that Parliament 

B. I understand not how the dreams and prognostica- 
tions of madmen (for such I take to be all those that fore- 
tell future contingencies) can be of any great disadvantage 
to the commonwealth. 

A. Yes. You know' there is nothing that renders 
human counsels difficult, but the uncertainty of future time ; 
nor that so well directs men in their deliberations, as the 
foresight of the sequels of their actions ; prophecy being 
many times the principal cause of the event foretold. If, 
upon some prediction, the people should have been made 
confident that Oliver Cromwell and his army should be, 
up(»n a day to come, utterly defeated ; would not every one 
have endeavoured to assist, and to deser\*e well of the party 
that should give him that defeat ? Upon this account it 
was that fortune-tellers and astrologers were so often 
banished out of Rome. 

The last memorable thing this year, was a motion made 
by a member of the House, an alderman of London, that 
the Protector might be petitioned and advised by the House 
to leave the title of Protector, and take upon him that of 
King. 

B, That was indeed a bold motion, and which would, if 
prosperous, have put an end to '*'a great"*" many men's ambi- 
tion, and to the licentiousness of the whole army. I think 
the motion was made on purpose to ruin both the Protector 
himself and his ambitious officers. 

A, It may be so. In the year 1657 the first thing the 
Parliament did, was the drawing up of this petition to the 
Protector, to take upon him the government of the three 
nations, with the title of King. As of other former Par- 
liaments, so of this, the greatest part had been either kept 
out of the House by force, or else themselves had forborne 

« Yes, yes : know. 



DUhgiuK. BEHEMOTH. 189 

to nt and become goQ^ of setting op this King Oliten 
But those few that sat, presented their petition to the Pro- 
tector, April the 9th9 in the Banqueting-house at Whitehall ; 
where Sir Thomas Widdrington, the Speaker, used the first 
arguments^ and the Protector desired some time to seek 
God, the business being weighty. The next day they sent 
a committee to him to receive his answer ; which answer 
being not very dear, they pressed him again for a resolu- 
tion ; to which he made answer in along speech, that ended 
in a peremptory refusal. And so retaining still the title of 
Protector, he took upon him the government according to 
certain articles contained in the said petition. 
B. ^Vhat made him refuse the title of King? 

A, Because he durst not take it at that time ; the army 
being addicted to their great officers, and amongst their 
great officers many hoping to succeed him, and, the succes- 
sion having been promised to Major-General Lambert, 
would have mutinied against him. He was therefore forced 
to stay for a more propitious conjuncture. 

B. What were those articles? 

A. Tlie most important of them were : i. That he would 
exercise the office of chief-magistrate of England, Scotland, 
and Ireland, under the title of Protector, and govern the 
same according to the said petition and advice : and that 
he would in his life-time name his successor. 

B. I believe the Scots, when they first rebelled, never 
thought of being governed absolutely, as they were by Oliver 
Cromwell. 

A. 2. That he should call a Parliament every three years 
at farthest 3. That those persons which were legally 
chosen members, should not be secluded without consent of 
the House. In allowing this clause, the Protector observed 
not that the secluded members of this same Parliament, are 
thereby re-admitted. 4. The members were qualified. 5. 
The power of the Other House was defined 6. That no 
law should be made but by Act of Parliament 7. That a 
constant yearly revenue of a million of pounds should be

settled for the maintenance of the army and navy; and 
300^000^ for the support of the government, besides other 
temporaxy supplies as the House of Commons should think . 
fit 8. That all the officers of state should be chosen by 
the Parliament. 9. That the Protector should encourage 
the ministry. Lastly, that he should cause a profession of 
religion to be agreed on and published. There are divers 
others of less importance. Having signed the articles, he 
was presently with great ceremony installed anew. 

B. What needed that, seeing he was still but Protector? 

A. But the articles of this petition were not all the same 
with those of his former instrument For now there was 
to be another House ; and whereas before, his council was 
• to name his successor, he had power now to do it himself; 
so that he was an absolute monarch, and might leave the 
succession to his son if he would, and so successively, or 
transfer it to whom he pleased. 

The ceremony being ended, the Parliament adjourned to 
the 20th of January following ; and then the Other House 
also sat ; '''and the secluded members according to an article 
of the petition sat'*' with their fellows. 

The House of Commons being now full, took little notice 
of the Other House, wherein there were not of sixty persons 
above nine lords ; but fell a questioning all that their fellows 
had done, during the time of their seclusion ; whence had 
followed the avoidance of the power newly placed in the 
Protector. Therefore, going to the House, he made a 
speech to them, ending in these words : By the living God, 
I must, and do dissolve you. 

In this year, the English gave the Spaniard another great 
blow at Santa Cruz, not much less than that they had given 
him the year before in the bay ofCadiz. 

About the time of the dissolving of this Parliament, the 
royalists had another design against the Protector; which 
was, to make an insurrection in England, the King being 
'''then"*" in Flanders ready to second them with an army thence. 
But this also was discovered by treachery, and came to 



DMtiUiA. BEHEMOTH. 191 



bat tbe ndn of those who wore eopged in it| 
whereof many in the bq^ning of the neit year were by a 
High Court of Justice imprisoned, and some executed. 

This year also was Major-General Lambert put out of all 
employmenti a man second to none but Oliver m the favour 
of Uie army. But because he expected by that favour, or 
by promise from Uie Protector, to be his successor in the 
supreme power, it would have been dangerous to let him 
. have command in the army ; the Protector having designed 
for his successor his eldest son Richard. 

In the year 1658, September the 3rd, the Protector died 
at Whitehall ; having ever since his last establishment been 
perplexed with fears of being killed by some desperate at- 
tempt of the royalists. 

Being importuned in his sickness by his privy-coundl to 
name his successor, he named his son Richard ; who^ en- 
couraged thereunto, not by his own ambition, but by Fleet- 
wood, Desborough, Thurlow, and other of his council, was 
content to take it upon him ; and presently addresses were 
made to him from the armies in England, Scotland, and 
Ireland. His first business was the chargeable and splendid 
funeral of his father. 

Thus was Richard Cromwell seated on the imperial 
throne of England, Ireland, and Scotland, successor to his 
father ; lifted up to it by the officers of the army then in 
town, and congratulated by all the parts of the army through- 
out the three nations; scarce any garrison omitting their 
particular flattering addresses to him. 

B, Seeing the army approved of him, how came he so soon 
cast off? 

A, The army was inconstant ; he himself irresolute, and 
without any military glory. And though the two principal 
officers had a near relation to him ; yet neither of them, but 
Lambert, was the great favourite of the army ; and by court- 
ing Fleetwood to take upon him the Protectorship, and by 
tampering with the soldiers, had gotten again to be a colonel 
He and the rest of the officers had a council at Wallingford

House (where Fleetwood dwelt) for the dispossessing of 
Richard; though they had not yet considered how the 
nations should be governed afterwards. For from the be- 
ginning of the rebellion, the method of ambition was con- 
stantly this : first to destroy, and then to consider what they 
should set up. 

B. Could not the Protector, who kept his court at White- 
hall, discover what the business of the officers was at Walling- 
ford House, so near him ? 

A, Yes, he was by divers of hb friends informed of it ; 
and counselled by some of them, who would have done it, 
to kill the chief of them ; but he had not courage enough to 
give them such a commission. He took, therefore, the 
counsel of some milder persons, which was to call a Parlia- 
ment Whereupon writs were presently sent to those, that 
in the last Parliament were the Other House, and other 
writs to the sheriffs for the election of knights and burgesses, 
to assemble on the 27 th of January following. Elections 
were made according to the ancient manner, and a House 
of Commons now of the right English temper, and about 
four hundred in number, including twenty for Scotland, 
and as many for Ireland Being met, they take themselves, 
without the Protector and Other House, to be a Parlia- 
liament, and to have the supreme power of the three nations. 

For their first business, they intended "'to question"^ the 
power of that Other House : but because the Protector had 
recommended to them for their first business an act (already 
drawn up) for the recognition of his Protectoral power, they 
began with that ; and voted (after a fortnight's deliberation) 
that an act should be made whereof this act of recognition 
should be part ; and that another part should be for the 
bounding of the Protector's power, and for the securing the 
privileges of Parliament and liberties of the subject ; and that 
all should pass together. 

B, Why did these men obey the Protector at first, in 
meeting upon his only summons? Was not that as full a 
recognition of his power as was needful ? ^Vhy by this 






JMUgui^. BEHEMOTH. 

example did they teach the people that he was to be obeyed, 
and then by patting laws upon him, teach them the contiaxy? 
Was it not the Protector that made the Fftrliament? Why 
did they not acknowledge their maker? 

A. I believe it is the desire of most men to bear mle ; 
but few of them know what title one has to it more than 
another, besides the right of the sword. 

B. If they acknowledged the right of the sword, they 
were neither just nor wise to oppose the present government, 
set up and approved by all the forces of the three kingdoms. 
The principles of this House of Commons were^ no doubt, 
the very same with theirs who began the rebellion; and 
would, if they could have raised a sufficient army, have done 
the same against the Protector ; and the general of their 
army would, in like manner, have reduced them to a Rump. 
For they that keep an army, and cannot master it, must be 
subject to it as much as he that keeps a lion in his house; 
The temper of all the Parliaments, since the time of Queen 
Elizabeth, has been the same with the temper of this Par* 
liament ; and shall always be such, as long as the Presby- 

erians and men of democratical principles have the like 
influence upon the elections. 

A. After ^this**" they resolved concerning the Other Hous^ 
that during this Parliament they would transact with it, but 
without intrenching upon the right of the peers, to have writs 
sent to them in all future Parliaments. These votes being 
passed, they proceed to another, wherein they assume to 
themselves the power of the militia. Also to show their 
supreme power, they delivered out of prison some of those 
that had been (they said) illegally committed by the former 
Protector. Other points concerning civil rights and con- 
cerning religion, very pleasing to the people, were now also 
under their consideration. So that in the end of this year 

*" the Protector was no less jealous of the Parliament, than of 
the council of officers at Wallingford House. 

B. Thus it is when ignorant men will undertake reforma- 
tion. Here are three parties, the Protector, the Parliament, 

14 



194 BEHEMOTH. malogue 4. 

and the Anny. The Ftotector against Parliament and anny, 
the Fftrliament against anny and Protector, and the army 
against Protector and Parliament 

A. In the beginning of 1659 the Parliament passed divers 
other actSL One was, to forbid the meetings in council of 
the army-officers without order from the Protector and both 
the Houses ; another, that no man shall have any command 
or ""place oP trust in the army, who did not first, under his 
hand, engage himself never to interrupt any of the members, 
but that they might freely meet and debate in the House. 
And to please the soldiers, they voted to take presently into 
consideration the means of paying them their arrears. But 
whilst they were considering this, the Protector (according to 
the first of those acts) forbad the meeting of officers at 
Wallingford House. This made the government, which by 
the disagreement of the Protector and army was already 
loose, to fall in pieces. For the officers from Wallingford 
House, with soldiers enough, came over to Whitehall, and 
brought with them a commission ready drawn (giving power 
to Desborough to dissolve the Parliament) for the Protector 
to sign ; which also, his heart and his party failing him, he 
signed. The Parliament nevertheless continued sitting; 
but at the end of the week the House adjourned till the 
Monday after, being April the 25th. At dieir coming on 
Monday morning, they found the door of the House shut 
up, and the passages to it filled with soldiers, who plainly 
told them they must sit no longer. Richard's authority and 
business in town being thus at an end, he retired into the 
country ; where within a few days (upon promise of the pay- 
ment of his debts, which his father's funeral had made great) 
he signed a resignation of his Protectorship. 

B. To whom ? 

A. To nobody. But after len days* cessation of the 
sovereign power, some of the Rumpers that were in town, 
together with the old Speaker, Mr. William Lenthal, resolved 
amongst themselves, and with Lambert, Hazlerig, and other 
officers, who were also Rumpers, in all forty-two, to go

CiomweD, with ihe title of Protector. SixtMy, from Sep- 
tember the 3rd 1658 to April the 95th 16591 Richard Crom« 
well had it as successor to his £either. Seventhly, from April 
the 95th 1659 to May the 7th of the same year, it was 
nowhere; Eighthly, from May the 7th 1659, the Rump, 
which was turned out of doors in 1653, recovered it again ; 
and shall lose it again to a committee of safety, and again 
recover it, and again lose it to the right owner. 

B. By whom, and by what art, came the Rump to be 
turned out the second time ? 

A. One would think them safe enough. The army in 
Scotland, which when it was in London had helped Oliver 
to put down the Rump, submitted now, bagged pardon, and 
promised obedience. The soldiers in town had their pay 
mended, and the commanders everywhere took the old 
engagement, whereby they had acknowledged their autho- 
rity heretofore. They also received their commissions in the 
House itself from the speaker, who was generalissimo. 
Fleetwood was made lieutenant-general, with such and so 
many limitations as were thought necessary by the Rump, 
tihat remembered how they had been served by the general, 
Oliver. Also Henry Cromwell, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, 
having resigned his commission by command, returned into 
England. 

But Lambert, to whom (as was said) Oliver had promised 
the succession, and as well as the Rump linew the way 
to the Protectorship by Oliver's own footsteps, was re- 
solved to proceed in it upon the first opportunity; which 
presented itself presently after. Besides SDme plots of 
royalists, whom after the old fashion they again persecuted, 
there was an insurrection made against them by Presby- 
terians in Cheshire, headed by Sir George Booth, one of 
the secluded members. They were in number about 3,000, 
and their pretence was for a free Parliament. There was a 
great talk of another rising, or endeavour to rise, in Devon- 
shire and Cornwall at the same time. To suppress Sir 
George Booth, the Rump sent down more than a sufficient 



Dial^gmA. BEHEMOTH. 197 

anny under Lambert; which quickly defeated the Oieshire 
party* and leoovcfed Chester, liveipool, and all the other • 
places they had seized Divers also of their commanders 
in and after the battle were taken prisonersi whereof Sir 
George Booth himself was one. 

This exploit done, Lambert, before his return, caressed 
his soldiers with an entertainment at his own house in York- 
shire, and got their consent to a petition to be made to the 
House, that a general might be set up m the army; as 
being unfit that the army should be judged by any power 
extrinsic to itselC 

B. I do not see that unfitness. 

A. Nor L But it was (as I have heard) an axiom of Sir 
Henry Vane's. But it so much displeased the Rump, that 
they voted, that the having of more generals in the army 
than were already settled, was unnecessary, burthensome^ 
and dangerous to the commonwealth. 

B, This was not Oliver's method; for though this 
Cheshire victory had been as glorious as that of Oliver at 
Dunbar, yet it was not the victory that made Oliver general, 
but the resignation of Fairfax, and the proffer of it to Crom- 
well by the Parliament 

A, But Lambert thought so well of himself^ as to expect 
it Therefore, at his return to London, he and other of the 
officers assembling at Wallingford House, drew their petition 
into form, and called it a representation ; wherein the chief 
point was to have a general, but many others of less import- 
ance were added ; and this they represented to the Houses 
October the 4th, by Major-General Desborough. And this so 
far forth awed them, as to teach them so much good manners 
as to promise to take it presently into debate. Which they 
did; and October the 12th, having recovered their spirits, 
voted : that the commissions of Lambert, Desborough, and 
others of the council at Wallingford House, should be void : 
item, that the army should be governed by a commission to 
Fleetwood, Monk, Hazlerig, Walton, Morley, and Overton, 
till February the 12th following. And to make this good 



19S BEHEMOTH. Zkalogua^ 

•gainst the force they expected from Lambeft» they ordered 
Hazlerig and Morley to issue warrants to such officers as they 
could trusty to bring their soldiers next morning into West- 
minster; which was done somewhat too late. For Lambert had 
first brought his soldiers thither, and beset the House, and 
turned back the Speaker, which was then coming to it ; but 
Hazlerig's forces marching about St. James's park-wall, came 
into St Margaret's churchyard ; and so both parties looked 
all day one upon another, like enemies, but offered not to 
fight : whereby the Rump was put out of possession of the 
House ; and the officers continued their meeting as before, 
at Wallingford House. 

There they chose from among themselves, with some few 
of the city, a committee, which they called the committee 
of safety, whereof the chief were Lambert and Vane > who, 
with the advice of a general council of officers, had power 
to call delinquents to trial, to suppress rebellions, to treat 
with foreign states, &c You see now the Rump cut off, 
and the supreme power (which is charged with salus populi) 
transferred to a Council of Officers. And yet Lambert 
hopes for it in the end But one of their limitations was, 
that they should within six weeks present to the army a new 
model of the government If they had done so, do you 
think they would have preferred Lambert or any other to 
the supreme authority therein, rather than themselves ? 

B^ I think not When the Rump had put into com- 
mission, amongst a few others, for the government of the 
army, that is to say, for the government of the three nations. 
General Monk, already commander-in-chief of the army in 
Scotland, and that had done much greater things in this 
war than Lambert, how durst they leave him out of this 
committee of safety? Or how could Lambert think that 
General Monk would forgive it, and not endeavour to &sten 
the Rump again ? 

A. They thought not of him ; his gallantry had been 
shown on remote stages, Ireland and Scotland. His am- 
bition had not appeared here in their contentions for the 



DiaUfgMi4» 



BEHEMOTH. 



i» 



government^ but be had complied both with Richaid and 
the Rump. After General Monk had signified Iqr letter his 
dislike of the proceedings of Lambert and his fellows^ they 
were much surprised, and began to think him more con- 
siderable than diey had done; but it was too late. 

B. Why? His army was very small for so great an enter* 
pris& 

A. The general knew very well his own and their forces, 
both what they were then, and how they might be augmented, 
and what generally city and country wished for, which was 
the restitution of the King : which to bring about, there 
needed no more but to come with his army (though not very 
great) to London; to the doing whereof^ there was no 
obstacle but the army with Lambert What could he do in 
this case ? If he had declared presently for the King or 
for a free Parliament, all the armies in £ngland would have 
joined against him, and assuming the title of a Parliament 
would have furnished themselves with money. 

General Monk, after he had thus quarrelled by his letter with 
the Council of Officers, secured first those officers of his own 
army which were Anabaptists aiid therefore not to be trusted^ 
and put others into their places; then drawing his forces 
together, marched to Berwick. Being there, he indicted a 
convention of the Scots, of whom he desired that they 
would take order for the security of that nation in his 
absence, and raise some maintenance for his army in their 
march. The convention promised for the security of the 
nation their best endeavour, and raised him a sum of money, 
not great, but enough for this purpose, excusing themselves 
upon their present wants. On the other side, the committee 
of safety with the greatest and best part of their army sent 
Lambert to oppose him ; but at the same time, by divers 
messages and mediators urged him to a treaty ; which he 
consented to, and sent three officers to London to treat with 
^as many of theirs. These six suddenly concluded (without 
power from the general) upon these articles : that the King 
be excluded ; a free state settled ; the ministry and uni- 



BEHEMOTH. iHahgutA^ 

▼erndes encouraged ; with diveiB others. Which the general 
liked not, and imprisoned one of his coni?iiRsioners for 
exceeding his commission. Whereupon another treaiy was 
agreed on, of five to five. But whilst these treaties were 
in hand, Hazlerig, a member of the Rump, seized on 
Portsmouth, and the soldiers sent by the committee of 
safety to reduce it, instead of that, entered into the town 
and joined with Hazlerig. Secondly, the city renewed their 
tumults for a free Parliament Thirdly, the Lord Fairfax, a 
member also of the Rump, and greatly favoured in York- 
shire, was raising forces there behind Lambert, who being 
now between two armies, his enemies would gladly have 
fought with the general. Fourthly, there came news that 
Devonshire and Cornwall were listing of soldiers. Lastly, 
Lambert's army wanting money, and sure they should not be 
furnished from the Council of Officers, which had neither 
authority nor strength to levy money, grew discontented, 
and (for their free quarter) were odious to the northern 
countries. 

£. I wonder why the Scots were so ready to furnish 
General Monk with money ; for they were no friends to the 
Rump. 

A. I know not; but I believe the Scots would have 
parted with a greater sum, rather than the English should 
not have gone together by the ears amongst themselves. 
The Council of Officers being now beset with so many ene- 
mies, produced speedily their model of government ; which 
was to have a free Parliament, which should meet December 
the 15th, but with such qualifications of no King, no House 
of Lords, as made the city more angry than before. To 
send soldiers into the west to suppress those that were rising 
there, they durst not, for fear of the city ; nor could they 
raise another for want of money. There remained nothing 
but to break, and quitting Wallingford House to shift for 
themselves. This coming to the knowledge of their army^ 
in the north, they deserted Lambert ; and the Rump, thel 
26th of December, re-possessed the House. • 



DiahgMK. BEHEMOTH. 90K 

B. Seeing the Rump was now reseated, the bostness 
pretended by General Monk for his marching to London, 
"Was at an end. 

A. I'he Rump, though seated, was not well settled, tmt 
^in the midst of so many tumults for a free Parliament) had 
as much need of the general's coming up now as before. 
He therefore sent them word, that because he thought 
them not yet secire enough, he would come up to London 
with his army; which they not only accepted, but also 
intreated him to do, and voted him for his services i,ooo/. a 
year. 

The general marching towards London, the country every- 
where petitioned him for a free Parliament. The Rump, to 
make room in London for his army, dblodged their own. 
The general for all that, had not let fall a word in all this 
time that could be taken for a declaration of his final 
design. 

B. How did the Rump revenge themselves on Lambert ? 
A, They never troubled him ; nor do I know any cause 

of so gentle dealing with him : but certainly Lambert was 
the ablest of any officer they had to do them service, when 
they should have means and need to employ him. After 
the general was come to London, the Rump sent to the 
city for their part of a tax of 100,000/. a month, for six 
months, according to an act which the Rump had n^ade 
formerly before their disseisin by the committee of safety. 
But the city, who were adverse to the Rump, and keen 
upon a free Parliament, could not be brought to give their 
money to their enemies and to purposes repugnant to their 
own. Hereupon the Rump sent order to the general to 
break down the city gates and their portcullises, and to 
imprison certain obstinate citizens. This he performed, 
and it was the last service he did hem. 

About this time the commission, by which General Monk 

, with others had the government of the army put into their 

hands by the Rump before the usurpation of the Council of 

Officers, came to expire ; which the present Rump renewed.

B. He was thereby the sixth part of the general of the 
whole forces of the commonwealth. If I had been as the 
Rump, he should have been sole general In such cases as 
this^diere cannot be a greater vice than pinching. Ambition 
should be liberal 

A. After the pulling down of the city gates, the general 

sent a letter to the Rump, to let them know that that service 

was '^very'^ much against his nature, and to put thetn in mind 

how well the city had served the Parliament throughout the 

whole war. ^..^ 

I B. Yes. But for the city the Parliament never could 

I have made the war, nor the Rump ever have murdered the 

< King. 

A. The Rump considered not the merit of the ciiy, nor 
the good-nature of the general They were busy. They 
were giving out commissions, making of acts for abjuration 
of the King and his line, and for the old engagement, and 
conferring with the city to get money. The general also 
desired to hear conference between some of the Rump and 
some of the secluded members, concerning the justice of 
their seclusion, and of the hurt that could follow from tlicir 
readmission : and it was granted. After long conteri nee, 
the general finding the Rump's pretences unreasonable and 
ambitious, declared himself (with the city) for a free Porlia- 
ment, and came to Westminster with the secluded members 
(whom he had appointed to meet and stay for him at 
Whitehall), and replaced them in the House amongst the 
Rumpers ; so that now the same cattle that were in the 
House of Commons 1640, except those that were dead, 
and those that went from them to the late King at Oxford,. 
are all there again. 

B. But this (methinks) was no good service to the King,, 
unless they had learned better principles. 

A. They had learned nothing. The major part was now 
again Presbyterian. It is true they were so grateful to 
General Monk as to make him general of all the forces in 
the three nations. They did well also to make void the 



DMogne 4. BEHEMOTH. 

engagement ; but it wis because those acts were made to . 
the prejudice of their party; but recaUed nothing of their 
own rebellious ordinances, nor did anything in order to the 
good of the present King; but. on thie contraiy, they de- 
clared by a vote : that the late King began the war against 
his two Houses. 

B. The two Houses considered as two persons, were 
they not two of the King's subjects? If a king raise an 
army against his subject, is it lawful for that subject to resist 
with force, when (as in this case) he might have had peace 
upon his submission ? 

A. They knew they had acted vilely and sottishly ; but 
because they had always pretended to greater than ordinary 
wisdom and godliness, they were loath to confess it The 
Presbyterians now saw their time to make a Confession of 
their Faith, and presented it to the House of Commons ; ' 
which the Commons, to show they had not changed their 
principles (after six readings in the House) voted to be 
printed, and once a year to be read publicly in every church. 

B. I say again, this re-establishing of the Long Parlia- 
ment was no good service to the King. 

A. Have a little patience. They were re-established with 
ivo conditions, one : to determine their sitting before the 
jnd of March, another : to send out >vrits before their rising 
for new elections. 

B. That qualifies. 

A. That brought in the King : for few of this Long Par« 
[ llament (the country having felt the smart of their former 

service) could get themselves chosen again. This New 

[arliament began to sit April the 35th i66a How soon 

^ese called in the King ; with what joy and triumph he 

received ; how earnestly his Majtbly pressed the Par- 

likment for the act of oblivion, and how few were excepted 

out of it ; you know as well as L 

B, But I have not yet observed in the Presbyterians any 

' . . • House of Commons, to show . . . principles ; which» after 
• . . House, was voted to be, &c 



204 BEHEMOTH. Diah^^uii^ 

oblinon of their former princtpleb. We are but returned to 
the state we were in at the beginning of the sedition. 

A. Not so : for before that time, though the Kings of 
England had the right of the militia in virtue of the sove- 
reignty, and without dispute, and without any particular act 
of Parliament directly to that purpose ; yet now, after this 
bloody dispute, the next (which is the present) Parliament, 
in proper and express terms hath declared the same to be 
the right of the King only, without either of his Houses of 
Parliament ; which act is more instructive to the people, 
than any arguments drawn from the title of sovereign, and 
consequently fitter to disarm the ambition of all seditious 
haranguers for the time to come. ^ 

B, I pray God it prove so. Howsoever, I must confess 
that this Parliament has done all that a Parliament can do 
for the security of our peace : which I think also would be 
enough, if preachers would take heed of instilling evil prin- 
ciples into their auditory. I have seen in this revolution a 
circular motion of the sovereign power through two usurpers, 
'^father and son'^, from the late King to this his son. For 
(leaving out the power of the Council of Officers, which was 
but temporary, and no otherwise owned by them but in trust) 
it moved from King Charles I. to the Long Parliament; 
from chence to. the Rump ; from the Rump to Oliver 
Cromwell; and then back again from Richard Cromwell 
to the Rump ; .thence to the Long Parliament; and thence 
to King Charles IL, where long may it remain. 

A. Amen. And may he have as often as there shall be 
need such a general. 

B. You have told me little of the general till now in the 
end : but truly, I think the bringing of his little army entire 
out of Scotland up to London, was the greatest stratagem 
that is extant in history.
