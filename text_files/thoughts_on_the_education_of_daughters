not very weighty rcafons to prevent 
her) ought to fuckle her children. 
Her milk is their proper nutriment,

Were a regular mode of fuckling a- 
dopted, it would be far from being a 
laborious talk. Children, who are left 
to the care of ignorant nurfes, have 
their ftomachs overloaded with impro- 
per food, which turns acid, and renders 
them very uncomfortable. We fhould

years of a child's life are frequently . 
made miferable through negligence or

ly in their ftomach or bowels; and 
thefe complaints generally arife from 
the quality and quantity of their food. 

The fuckling of a child alfo excites 
the warmed glow of tendernefs— Its 
dependant, helplefs ftate produces an 
affeftion, which may properly be term- 
ed maternal. I have even felt it, when

ARTIFICIAL MANNERS. 

TT may be thought, that artificial 
manners and exterior accomplifli-

the former take a far wider range, and 
are materially different. The one arifcs 
from affeSation, and the other fcems 
only an error in judgtnent. 

The emotions of the mind often ap- 
pear confplcuous in the countenance 
and manner. Thefe emotions, when 
they arife from fenfibility and virtue, 
are inexpreflibly pleafing. But it is 
cafier to copy the caft of countenance,

ro8 Dejuhory Thoughts. 

I am apt to imagine, that fdrrow and 
refignation arc not incompatible ; and 
that though religion cannot make fome 
difap^intments pleafarit, it prevents 
our repining, even while we fmart un- 
der them. Did our feelings and reafon- 
always coincide, our paffage through 
this world could not jaftly be termed 
a warfare, and faith would no longer 
be a virtue. It is our preferring the 
things that are not feen, to thofe which^ 
are, that proves us to be the heirs of 
promifc. 

On the facred word of the Moft 
High, we rely with firm aflurance, 
that the fufferings of the prcfcnt life

they are allowed to be affliftions,

. The difference between thofc who 
ibrrow without hope, and thofc who 
look up to Heaven, is not that the 
one feel mprc than the other, for they 
may be both equally deprcffed; but

By thefc means they would learn the

The having a fixed ftipend, too, would 

enable them to be charitable, in the
