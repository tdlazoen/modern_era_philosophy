TTiis work was printed many years ago. 

Circumstances prevented its being at that time ex- 
posed to sale. 

In regard to the Author, all that need be said is — 
that it teas not by him that it was then kept back ; and 
that it is not by him^ or at his instance, that itns now 
putforth. 

Ify on either accounts, it were desirable that the 
causes of its being thus long withheld should be brought 
to view, those causes wotUd afford a striking illustra- 
tion of the banqful influence of the principles and 
practices it is employed in unveiling, and presenting 
in their true colours.

§ 1. Work on libd Law commenced — Occasion of it. 

VV HAT gave rise to this work^ is neither more nor less 
than a newspaper article— an article in the Times for the 20th 
of Febmary 1809, and which, so far as it belongs to the 
present purpose, and consists of statements concerning mat- 
ters of fact^ is m these words : > , 
Speaking of a clamour against what is called the licentious* 
ness of the press,, the article goes on and says—** Such has 
^ been the dread inspired by this clamour, . . . .that of the 
** persons now under prosecution, two have actually pleaded 
•* ffuilty to informations for * mlfully and maliciously slander^ 
" tng the British army^ who never, till many days after their 
publication^ saw or heard of the libel with which they 
were charged; . . • • 

The grand fountain of all this mischief (It continues) 
^eems to be Major Hogan's pamphlet t • ^ • • $ for this 
very work there are now, or recently have been, we be- 
lieve, six-and'twenty printers and publishers under prose^* 
^ cutioo. It was only from one ot these that the original 
pamphlet sprung : the rest did no more than extract from 
or reconrmend it, and that upon the attested character of 
its author, who was no sooner known to have fled from 
•• hft charge^ than every one of them retracted his praiffe of 
** the work, and was willing to maiatan that the Dnkt of

ii Chap. I. Occasion of this IVorL 

^* YorA'S character stood as fair as if this individual arraign- 
" ment of it had not been published ; yet is this so far from 
*• having produced a disposition to recede from punishing 
•• them, that though the informations were all of them filed 
** last term, and^miight h^vt been tried during the present, 
•* the objects of them are, without any assigned cause, to be 
** kept in a harrassing state of suspense over the present to 
•• the term ensuing* 

*' And what is the origin of these men's, offences ? an error 
•* common to them with the prosecutor— a belief in the re- 
" spectability of Major Hogan's character, which was attested 
" by no fewer or less men than Generals Fox, Floyd, Whyte^ 
** Dundasi Macdonald\ Hall, Hay, Txlson, and Hamilton * 

** Can there be a stronger palliation of error, than that the 
" person erring should have been misled by a man of such 
** reputation as the above ; more especially when it is con- 
'• sidered that theDw^^ of York was himself as much deceived 
••as any one else by these testimonies in favour of Af<2/^r 
*' Hogan^ his Royal Highness, on the strength of them, be- 
*• lieved him to be deserving of rank and elevation in the 
•'army, and therefore ^ noted him Jbr promotion.' Others,, on 
•^ the very same authority, supposed only that he might Jbe 
•• entitlea to common credit, and are, therefore, notwith- 
•• standing all their renunciations of that opinion, • noted for 
** prosecution »'* 

Thus far the newspaper. Facts, in their nature so noto- 
rious, seemed not likely to have been either invented, ur so 
much as materially misrepresented. I looked out for contra- 
diction or correction, but could hear of none. Whatever 
I could learn went in confirmation of the statements given 
^ above. . 

. On tbe subject of JJbel Law my general conception had 
<been of some thirty or forty years standing : for example, 
that, in point of actual law, a libel is any paper in which he, 
who to the wiU adds the power of punishing for it, sees, any 
thing that he does not Hie: and, in point oi public utility, that 
it was neither necessary npr fitting, that any part of the rule of 
,action, much less so important a one, should be lying in any 
such wild, and barbarous sute. Such on this subject, be- 
came my ofiinipn, almost as early as, on the subject of any part 
of the law, I could take ypon me to have any : but those 
opinions would scarcely have found any expression, ia public 
at least, andiin any considerable derail, but for the inc^nt 
^above*mentioned.

§ 1. Work vn LibdlAw commencedri^ccanon cfiU 3 

* Seeing thus that under the mask of a temporary occur* 
rence. a battery had been opened by the enemies of the con«« 
stitution upon the liberty of the press- — that a fire of grape sboi 
bad already been commenced, and no fewer than six-and- 
twenty persons wounded by it at one discharge, t felt my* 
self urged by an irresistible impulse to summon up whatever 
strength I might have left; and howsoever impotent my 
own feeble efforts might prove, and at whatever personal 
hazard, to shew the way at least how this bvftery might be 
spiked. , 

1. Libel Law as it stands, or rather as it floatSf is incfom* 
patible with English liberties. 

2. To destroy them utterly, and reduce the Government 
to a despotism, it requires nothing but to be conststeml/ 
and completely executed^ . 

3. In this state it must remain« until either the Constitu* 
tion is so destroyed, or, by authority of the l^sJature, cer» 
tain arrangements are made, the basis of which will be a 
definition, in form, of the sort of thing called a liMt or 
something that shall be equivalent to it. . 

4. In a fixation of this sort, though tbere is somediffi* 
culty, there is no natural impossibility. 

.£. It is from the hand of Parliament alone that this cry*! 
ing evil can receive a radical cure. 

6. But, in the intelligence and fortitude of a J^fj^y it may. 
in each instance, receive a momtntxty palliative* 

.7. Things being on this footing, in the case of a political U^ 
j^ iel^ aod— -(to fix conception)-«*in the case of the libel for which 
'Mr. Cqbbctt was QouviQit^^znA Mr. Justice Johnson %}xS^i^l9iij^ 
had I been upon the Jury, I should not have regarded it as. 
consistent nvith my oath and duty to join in ^ Verdict. o£ 
Guilty, . . 

. 8. Applying to this' use the power which, under the law 
of primaeval barbarism, any one determined Juryman has of 
subduing the deven others, I should have taken care that n^ 
such verdict should be found. 

0* By a few successive exertions of such fortitude, not 
only momentary and partial relief against particular o^pres^ 
sion would be afforded in each particular instance,— 

io. But by a gentle and truly consjUtutional pressure* mea- 
sures of complete and permanent relief might, as from the 
unjust Judge in the parable^ "be extorted from the legisbL*; 
ture^ *

paring to' submit to the public the considerations hy which 
they had been produced : when by another incident this de-'

one, rjfceived at the same time a collateral tum^ andr as te

'• JifRYMEN — Special Jurymen — are the persons you pro* 
** jiose to address: But, whatever you had to say, it being to 
** this effect, is there any the least chance that they would 
'^ listen to you ? The men whom, under the name oljfurymen, 
^ specialjurymen, you would, on any such occasion, have to 
•• oeal with — are tney in fact what they are said to be, and in 
^ general supposed to be? On any occasion, such as that in 
^ question, arethey really freetofoUowthedictatesofM^V^ie/n 
* judgment ? Can you see any the smallest probability of their 
^ doing so ?" Such were the questions suggested to me by the , 
publication oS the late Sheriffs Sir Richard yiilltps^z document 
which', tli6ugh it had been for some time in circulation, had 
not, ti)l a eonsiderable progress had been made in my own 
dbve-mienttoned work,.1bappened to fall into my hands. Such 
were the questions : and, to my unspeakable asti^nishment, no 
fooner were they formed than they received,, ^ach of them, 
to my apprehension, a decided n^^oAV^. 
' In eommon with the generality of my countrymen, no 
INurticuIar incident hsiving ever happened to point my aticn- 
tkmUP'iht subject,. I had been usedf to annex in my mind to 
At word: Jbr^, the idea of a momentarily assembled body of 
men, eomposed of members determinea by /!f/, or if py a 
nomination^ a nomination not differing in effect from deters 
mination fy lot, — the nomination performed afresh for the 
purpose of each causo^ the list of ttie members of whieh th^ 
Body was composed in each cause, changing, perpetually as 
between cause agid cause. 

In this particular I had* indeed understood the term 
special jury to be expressive of some difference : but a dif« 
terence by mean» of which, the advantage attached to a for- 
tuitouB assemblage being preserved,, further advantage, re- ^ 
suiting from a tort of reciprocal choice as between party and 
party, had» by the matured sagacity of modem timea^ been 
superadded. . 

In common with such others of my countryidenr whose. 



. f 2. W^0ri0nUMLsfawhyp9Sif^dtothu.z &^ 

education has conducted them through the ^Snary p^dis o^ 
iisUry^ I had read of a species of judicial abuse, which, under; 
the nfime of packings h^d on this Or that occasipn broken ^lat, 
in former times, and in particular in the profligate^ sgid arbp^ 
trary reigns of the two( last Stuarts. 

My astonishment has not oftentimes been greater thim 
it became, when, upon looking into the book for which, a^f 
above* the public is indebted to the late shrievalty of Sit 
Siciard PktUips^ I foupd that tliis practice called packings ^. 
iSwd whichft when thus applied* had neyerpresented itself 
to my mind but in the character qf the doiomination of 4 
state crime, nor that exemplified but rarely, and und^ adisr 
astrous state of thinsa long since past, had been moulded 
into a system^ had become an. established practice«-a sor^ 
of practice which by the quality of the practitioners has, as 
^ip-mo^€y had once^ licquired. the Jforce of /<i2t/ $ and that iq 
that character it had found, in the person of the Chief Judg^ 
\ of one of the three ereat commK>n law cojutts, not cmy an , 
ugeni^ perhaps an author to avow it, but moreover a champion 
40 defend it. ^ 

For sometime I could scarce give credit to my own eyev 
Am I indeed awake ?«-*«>Is not thu a dres^m ? — What century 
is this ?-r-Can it be the ioth 7r— Is it not the 17th ?_Whp 
reigns now ?«^-Can it be a arunswick ?— Is it not a Stuaif 
king come, according to the prophetic and once loyal hytnn,

It is but too true* Under the name of a Jury«^-under th^ 
name even of that supposed improved species pf^ i^V* #

SBinal cases exceptc^d, we are, under this spedal jury system^ 
no worse off than our ancestors were in the time ot the two 
bit Stuarts. Package of Juries was in those tithes no more 
tnan an ieffbrt of casual violence and passion, losing more by 
the general irritation it produced, than by the particular advan- 
tage of the moment it could gain. It is now, as will be seen,

our necks are already Jashionei to it.' . 

As to the iitk^i this work. Elements of the Art of Pack' 
ingt it is not a mere jest* In the bringing of the system to 
its present state, no small degree of ingenuity, it will be 
teen, has been expended ; nor, to the present purpose, could 
the true nature of it have been sufficiently displayed, with- 
out considerable labour, in short without a pretty ample 
bourse of developement— -applied to its objects^ its ^ects^ ii% 
'motives^ and its means. 

In bringing into view this sinister species of art, the ob- 
ject of these pages is^^o do what may be found capable of

CHAP. II. JtmiKs-— TREiR Use as a Check to Judges. 

Of the functions exercised by the body of unlearned as- 
sessors, termed Jur^s or Jurymen^ the original intention, 
us well as es^perienced usle, seems to be universally agreed, 
as well as understood, to be-^-the serving as a check upon the 
power of the learned and experienced Judge or. Judges, 

^ under whose direction, or guidance at least, they baa^e to act. 

^ In name, the decision pronounced in each cause, that deci- 
sion at least to which the name of verdict is given} and in

which not only the question of fact is decided- upon, but a 
decision 09 the question of law (except in the particular 
case of a special verdia) is involved, is ascribed to themi as 
if it were theirs alone:, but, besides the power of lendTng 
the cause to a new trial before another jury, the effect of the 
power exercised by the professional Judges is upon the whole 
€o great, (the verdict having in no instance any effect until 
it be followed by a corresponding decision distinguished by 
the name of the jtufgrnrnt^ the formation of which depends 
altogether on the professional part of thefcompound judica* 
toryj — that a concqption nearer to the truth will be formed, by 
.considering the maxn or principal power as in the hands of the 
Jfudge^ that of the jury serving as a check to his power, than 
by considering thi^ principal power in the hands of the jury^ 
.that of the Judge serving as a check to theirs. 

That, of the unlearned body so designed to operate as a 
check the members ought, so far as concerns the exercise of 
the functions belonging to their body, to be in a state of inde- 
pendence — of independence as perfect as possible-i^is a propo- 
sition included in the very denomination of a checks To deny 
the truth of it is to utter a contradiction in terms. To say 
. that there ougl^ not to be any such independence, is the same 
thing as to say that there ought not to be any such check. 

In appearance this sort of independence is, in modei:n 
practice, every where, in every part of the field of jury-trial, 
actually preserved. That which, on the occasion of each 
.trial, tha jMdge or Judges, who constitute the professioniil 
.part of the mixt judicatory, have power, say, ior shortness, 
the Judge has power, to do, is to compel the non-profes- 
sional part, the jury, to pronounce a decision, termed its 
verdict:- that which he has not the power to do,' is to d(^tet- ' 
mine what that verdict shall be.. 

Great, however, as istbe p^er of the Judge, in every 
case, over the ultimate result of the cause, yet, so far as 
concerns the decision pronounced or supposed to.be pro- 
nounced by the jury, it applies more directly and certainly 
to ih^ prevention ol a verdict contrary to his wishes,* than to 

* In this case in the hands of the Judge, the most efficient instrument of in- 
justice may be seen in the principle and practice of nullification : by which, con- 

* stdeitd as applied to verdicts, the e0ect of them is destroyed, on pretences that 

* do not so much as profess to have any relation to the merits of the cause, ^e 
' 'pretence has always been the existence of some regul^Uion, or (as it is called, to 

-screen its non-existence from notice) some rule which, besides that it was never

When therefore, in purtuancis of a sinister interest, in 
whatsoever bosom it may have hsmpened to |t to originate, 
his oun% for frxatnple, that of the King, or that of any ser* 
vpnt of the King's in any other department of the state, it 
bas come to be an object with a Judge to ohUiin at the hands 
of a jury a vetdHt in any way contrary to justice, a neces- 
sary endeavour has b|^n to fihtain a jury ^ so coinposed, as 
that the verdict pirofiounced by them may be depended upon 
as about to be conformable to his wishes : to give, in a wprd^ 
to the judgment, which he has it in his wish and intention to 
pronounce, ^he appearance of being the proper ^nd neces- 
sary result of an antecedent decision, which, under the ap- 
propriate natpjs of a verdip$^ the jury h^ve, by the mouth of 
their foreman, pronounced, or aMeast been considered ^g hav- 
ing pronounced. 

It, in consequence of any sinister influence exercised ov^ 
their faculties by the Judge, a verdict, diilerem from what 
wopid otherwise have been pronounced by them, has been 
pronounced, tha^ influence will have assumed a very dif- 
ferent pharacter^ and have been produced by causes of a 
very different description, according as it is to the under* 
standing or the will that in each bosom it h^s applied itself. 

7o the t^niferstandifig of a juryman, as of any othf?jr man, 
though influences, which, be^ng unfavourable to justice, may 
be termed sinister, are liable to apply themselves from other 
quarters, yet so far as it has happiened to any f uch Influence to 
have been applied by any act of the Judge^ it is only by his 

havinc; obeyed it the possibtlitr of ol^eyiiig ^(--had never so much «s been in ex- 
istence. It was 019 each occasion invented, and set up, for the purpose of the 
l^iciilar ir^iustice that fvas tp be 4ffeie. 

Wrapped up in this device as in a cloak, the power of English judges has, un- 
f|er the scmblaiicp f^ linyita^on, been ifi every paft of the fielfl of jury trial (not 
' to look at present any further) little less than arbitrary : and to this hour o^

strong enough : if not, of some other understanding, on the 
relative strength of which (relation being had to tbe question 
in hand) its reliance is more assured. 

To the dictates therefore of anv other ce/iV/,. (he will of a 
juryman, as of any other judge, (the lawfully declared will 
of some lawful superior alone excepted, for which in the 
case of the juryman there is no place} cannot so much as

Judge, or any other will,, the influence, or,' as in this case it is 
stiled, the temptation^ to the assaults of which the pro* 
bity of the individual (in the present case the juryman) stands 
exposed, will apply itself in one or other of two shapes : 
in the shape of m/, viz. iiUapplied punishment^ working by 
intimidation; in the shape of good, viz. ill-applied reward^ 
working by corruption. 

Against ttiese two opposite dangers, provision was made in 
the principles which presided over the original organization 
and mode of procedure that took place in the case of these 
singularly constituted y«^'ca/^mj, or rather component parts 
of judicatories. 

Against undue intimdation^ they received for their prot<ec- 
tion, in the first place, exemption from any infliction which, 
avowedly and under the name of punishment^ might other* 
wise have been applied to any of them separately* by the 
arbitrary pibwer of the judge; in the next place, (being that

ing with his own^ miglit have time to mould into undue obse- 
quiousness the weakness of their minds; nor the casual 
^tempter — the party who, in the event of his obtaining any

cient prospect of success, might find himself disposed to 
apply the opportunity to any such sinister use.

§ 1. Checks are ever odious to all Persons checked. 

To the welfare of the governed-— of men considered as 
men subject to power^t is highly conducive at least, if not, 
(as under the British and other mixt or limited governments, 
men are apt to say,) altogether necessary ^ that in whatsoever 
hands ^(7t^^r^be lodged, checks to it, in some shape >or other, 
should, throughout the whole field of its exercise, be ap-

duced by the check, is not exceeded by the evil produced 
by the defalcation made by it from the quantity of power 
necessary to enable the holder of the power to render in the 
highest degree of perfection the service expected at his 

' "hands, the utility of the check will hardly find any person 

. to dispute it. 

But whatsoever be their utility, relation being had to the

hands by ztMch the pozaer is holden^ the sensation produced 
bv any thing which acts upon them in the character of a 
cneck^ never has been, nor ever can be, otherwise than un- 
pleasant. 



§ 1* Checks are ever odious to aU Persons thecked. 1 1 

How it happened that^ in England^ the operations of the 
king^s ever dependent Instruments, the official Judjges^ (not 
10 speak of the equally dependent instruments oi his imper* 
fectly subjected subordinates, the great Baronsj) found them* 
selves, in the infancy of the constitutioo, incumbered, and 
to so great an extent, by the presence and interference o£.a 
determinate numberoi imomcialassessori, still more igao« 
lant than themselves ; whild, in the other part of. the same 
island, the incumbrance was confined. to the* criminal divi* 
sion of the field of law, and even there to the upper parts 
of the ground ; and while, on the continent, either no such 
incumbrance was ever known, or was at a very early period 
got rid of ; these are among those points of legal history, the 
obscurity of which seems to have given them up beyond 
redemption to the arbitrary dominion of conjecture. 

Thus much however appears with tolerable distinctness ; 
m. tbat^ over a great part, if not the whole of that field, 
over which the jurisdiction of a limited and even fixt num- 
ber of assessors; under the denomination of jurymen, (petty 
jurymen,) extends itself, the ^rt of function now exer- 
cised by them was exercised by an unlimited and usually 
much larger number^ of the inhabitants of the district in 
question undef the name oi freeholders : by which denomi- 
nation were distinguished the whole of that comparatively 
small number of persons whose interests, according to the 
notions moral and legal of that time, had any claim to no« 
tice :*izni that, of this larger and im'^perfectly determinate 
body, the part now called a jury^ was a sort of select com* 
mttee, gradually and by general consent, the result of gene- 
.ral convenience, substituted to the ever fluctuating and un- 
wieldy whole. 

But though, in one shape or other, the incumbrance has 

from the earliest days of the existing constitution, been 

clinging to the shoulders of the official judge, yet, in what- 

. soever shape it clung, it could not have been Qtherwise than 

a troubleisome one* 

To. the free exercise of his poufer the obstruction given by 
it is sufficiently obvious { for, so often, and in such pro- 
portion, as he found it necessary to give effett to a wiU on 
their part, which^ howsoever expressed, differed ultimately 
from. his own wishes, so often, and in the same proportion, 
. was his power converted into impotence. 

Supposing even his will to have been in every instance 
nkimatiply. and Icumpletely prevalent, and, notwithstanding

the inciraibnuicet faU^Mver thus far unimpaired, even thus, 
#n comparing hit situation with that t>f a judge the free* 
dom of wt{oi^ actions is unrestrained by any such incuniM 
bfance, it will be manifest enough* that though his powet 
were ever %o intire, one effect^ inseparably attached \o thft 
nature of this incumbrance^ is«*-to afford, in one way or 
otb^, perpetual disturbance to hiacAtf. All their desire is 
to shape their wills to his, and for that purpose to kaoar 
what It is. Be it so. Yet to this purpose it may be no* 
cess^ry for him to m$ke them know what it is ; and sim« 
pie as it may be, to impress into^ their minds this article of 
Knowledge will, every new and then, require on his part, 
one of those operations which cannot always be performed 
without more or less (ksiwrbanct to the operator's ease. 

On the other hand, suppose on their parts any reluct* 
ance towards the adoption of his will, argument^ in some 
abape or other, would on his part be necessary to the xarr. 
mouniin^ of that reluctance; and so mu^h argument, so 
much time and trouble consumed, ia muck disturbance 
given to his ease. Let tljere even be no reluctance op- 
posed to his will, yet, if in their conceptions there should 
be any diffictdty in comprehending it,.stiU, to the removing 
or enaeavouring to remove any isuefa difBcuhy, explatuUUnt 
in some shape or other, would be necessaiy : more con« 
sumption of time and trouble ; more disturnance given to 



But to a man in power, it neither then was, norcto this 
time is, no, nor ever will be, natural to submit readily to 
iny such HmiaHon to his power as he can commodiously 
get rid of: it neither then was, now is, nor ever will be, 
natural to him, to suffer his own ease to remain exposed to 
any disturbance^ from which he can conveniently keep it 
clear. To keep it to a certain degriee habitualfy clear of 
disturbance, may, from time to time, cost him more and 
more labour^ giving to his ease more and more disturbance. 
But, be his expectations of neat profit, in that valuable shape, 
verified, or not, by the event, his exertions will not the less 
truly have had for their motive, the love of ease. 

On both these accounts therefore, and in which ever of 
^e two shapes he found the weight of this body of asses* 
sors pressiog upon him, the endeavours of the judge to diake 
off or lighten the incumbrance cannot but have been co« 
eval with its existence.

cuous assembly to which this sekct committee succeeded, all 
distinct remembrance, as well as desire, obliterated : obli- 
terated by this primaeval GrenviUe Act^ of which the record 
is no where to be found. 

For securing on the part of this select body of assessors, 
whose office was to keep a check upon his will, a subser^ 
vience as constant and prompt as possible to tliat wiJi, there- 
by impairing as far as possible the use and efficacy of that

Were afforded by the nature of the case : viz, intimidahan, 
carruptia^^ and deception: for such is the name that mayN 
with propriety be given to the influence of understanding 
over Unaerstanding, as often, and in proportion as the ex- 
ercise of it is recognised as operating to the prejudice of 
justice* 

. As to iniipddation^ in the character of an instrunient of io^

from the very first, have been too plainly incompatible with 
the acknowledged constitution oi this compound judica-r 
tory, and too insupportable to the feelings of the people, Uf 
be in ws^ thing like constant or even frequent use.*" 

Of punishment applied to this sinister purpose by the sole- 
power of the judge, in the shape of pedhiiary^^ for in- 
-stance, examples seem to have been not altogether wanting.

proof that of that suffering, though applied under the name 
of punishment^ and by judicial hands, the infliction could 
never hav^>een considered in any other light than that of 
a casual act, committed under the spur of extraordinary ir- 
ritation, by illegal violence.* 

Corruption^ the work of will operating upon will, and 
deception^ operating bv the influence of understanding over 
understanding, were therefore the only instruments affording 
any promise of being regularly and steadily applicable to 
this sinister service : viz^ the securing of undue obsequi- 
ousness pn the part of juries. 

§ 3. Corruption — Modes of applying tt^ 

In regard to corruption, the standing problem waSf and is, 
so to order matters, that, on each given occasion in which 
it may happen to the judge to take on any account an inte- 
rest in the verdict of the jury, it shall depend upon hhwiil^ 
with the surest effect, and with the least trouble possible, to 
mould it to his own desire. 

To this purpose, on the occasion of each verdict, the 
concurrence of two circumstances was, and is, necessary : 

- • In the State Trials we have a precedent of a Judge, a Loid Chief iustiotoi 
the King's Bench, who, to help satisfy the conscience of a Juror; treated him 
with a good shale ing-bout. The time was soon after the Restoration, anno 1064 : 
the Chief Justice, a Hyde, a relation and protegi of Lord Clarendon's : the 
Ykfendant, ^iUhetUry an Anabaptist: the libel purely of the htrtHcal class, a 
citss of libels of which happily mudi has not been heard of late yeait, at kwt 
under that name. It was however ** seditious and venomous" enough : and the 
sedition and venom of it consisted in maintaining, contrary to the Liturgy, that 
the proper age for Christians to be baptized at, was the age die apostles baptiieed 
them at— with other abominations of the^like stamp. 

The juryman, throug|& the medium of whose conscience the ooMeiences of 
die icst received satisfiietion in this mode, had made a visit to the bendi, and as 
it should seem by depmikoa from his fellows: permission had been granted. In 
consequence ot their « desire to knew whether one of them might not come and 
*<spesJc with his Lordship, about something whereof diey were in donbt** 
*' Then the oflScer called on^* (qusreby whom named— must it not have been Hj 
the Judge?) *< and he was set upon the clerk's table, and the Judge and ht whis- 
«< pered together a great while; and it was observed that the Judge, kmmghu 
** hands upon his shoulders, woutdfrequenily shake him as he spoke to khn. Upon 
** this person's remraing, the whole jury quickly came in, and being according to 
** custom called over by theii names, the deik proceeded— 

^ Clerk^^Are yon agreed in your verdia? 

*• Jiciy— 'Yet, yes. « St. Tr. sss." 
• The unaiiBiity thus pfompdy produced, by which species of indnence vmt k 
piodDoed? byth* ioAntoce qf will tnerwOl, of by the hoBmootrU uMiinia ii 4 
ing on understandinif perhi^ pvtly by the one, partly by dwoilMr. 



!• That, ia the' /event of their £nding * tlicinselveis in the 
skuation requisite^ [mz. that of inhabitants of a jury-box) 
there should exist a . Afficient number of pcrsbmjb^osfd^ 
no matter by what causes, to manifest the sort of otsequi^ 
ousness requisite : 2. That matters should so have beea or- 
dered, that in that requisite situation the persons so disposed 
should in each instance be tO:be found. 

There s^e two courses or orders of proceeding, in either 
of which this supposed unjust, but supposed desired result 
is capable of being produced: 1. Finding out persons ia 
wbbse instance the requisite disposition is already y^^rmo/, 
and thereupon placing them in the situation requisite.-r^ 
2. Qoing to work with a set of persons already stationed 
in the i2/fi<i^20» requisite,* and to the persons, so situated, 
.giving the dispcsUion requisite. 

, The 'first ot these two courses is tliat which, having bee& 
invented in the time of our ancestors, in a somewhat dis- 
.tant age, has from them received the name of packing :— « 
name which, from the application at that time but too fre« 
\\xcnt\\ made ol the practice, and thence habitually appre* 
bendea from it, has acquired a dysloff^stic tinge : serving at 
present to express, not merely the practice itself^ but the 
sent^nient of disapprobation excited by the idea of it, and 
.^us, by the principle of association, attached ta it* 

Of the two courses, this untient one is evidently by far 
the :most simple. 

In the other may be seen an example of a degree of re- 

rfinement reserved for modern times. A number of psrsons 

.whose. dispositions f in regard to the subject in question, are as 

yet unformed or unknown, being eoUected-^required to gene^ 

rate in their breasts the disposition requisite. Such is the 

.problem, the solution of which was necessary to the pur- 

suing of this second of the two courses. And, with what 

success it. has been accomplished, will, ere long it it sup- 

.|»osed, be not indistinctly visible. 

For this purpose the following process stands alike ap* 
pcoyed by theory and experience. 

Into the situation in question (it being a situation confer- 
ing power— -legal power) cause to be placed the number of 
persons requisite (tl^y being provided with the requisitie 
legal qualifications)— -you possessing in your hands, to a cer- 
tain exteiU, the faculty of influencing their interest or wel- 
fare (that is, producing in their respective bosoms th6' sca- 
sation of. p^uio or pleasure, or the eventual Absence oi 
eitliey)— and no preponderant fotft acting on the Sfune

In the science of psychological or moral d^namicst of 
which ^(?/2Vica/ is one branch, the above proposition, though 
never yet perhaps reduced to any sci'entific fofm of words, 
nay be stated as a fundamental axiom : and among pobKc 
men, under whatsoever degree of incapacity labouring in 
other respects, no man was ever yet found to any such de- 
^gree weak and incapable, as not to be sufficiently ^sensible 
•f the truth of it. 

A man may receive his ten, twenty, thirty, any number 
of thousand pounds a year, on pretence of his occupying a 
writing clerk's place, and this without being any more able 
than he is witting to do the duties of that place— ^nd yet be 
no less fully and adequately impressed witn the truth of the 
«bove proposition, long-winded as it is, than Bacon was, 
and accordingly not onh^ act, but get up and speak, accord* 
ing to his mode of speaKing, in exact conformity and con^ 
sequence : the orator, without parade or pedantic display of 
faard*worded science, acting psychological iynanacs, all the 
while, and to no less perfection, nor, if told of it, less 
perhaps to his surprise, tnan Monsieur Jourdan, when upon 
Deing thereof informed by his preceptor, be found himself 
talking j^^ji^. 

For effecting the solution in <^uestion by the application 
of the above axiom or rule, the simplest and most elegant 
of all modes which bath as yet been invented, perhaps, it 
may be added, which the science itself admits of, is — that 
wbtch you are enabled to put in practice, when the func- 
tions attached to the situation bein^, by a mass composed 
of the niattcr of wealth or other objects of desire (instru- 
roenuor efficient cause of pleasure of any sort at com« 
mand according to each man's taste,) worked up into a 
compound of an agreeable flavour, the continuance of the 
person in question in the situation which enables him to 
feed upon it« Yaa been made dependent on your will. So 
long as he continues in the situation, with sucb his allow-

Suppose, for example, ttife situation of 2i juryman thus at thd 
same time dulcified, aod (saving dismissal)j/f;tdrf; the power of 
distussal^ howsoever disguised, (and the more eSectually disi« 
guised the better} being' at the same time in your hands i 
upon the very face of this stat;ement it is evidefit, that f barf- 
ing the accident of opposite and preponderant force as abovei- 
inehtioned) the verdict of the jury, so far as depends upon 
that juryman, is altogether ^t your command.* 

In iiiii mode of solution, a necessary step, we see, is the 
placing the person in questioii in a situation in which he \i 
exposed to the action of the efficient cause of irtfiuence : 
viz, the matter, the ever pliant and ductile matter, which, iri 
your plastic hands, becomes the matter of reward or thrf 
matter ot puniskmnt, according as he behaves himself. Bdt 
{0 the situation, as above described, per,manence is neces-^ 
<ary \ aihd this — partly because without a certain degr^ of 
permanence the situation would not possess sufficient Valu^^ 
nor consequently the fear of losing it act on his mmd irf 
the character of an efficient cause 6f influence with a sti'f^ 
ficic^ht degree of force : partly because the Correspondetit! 
diiposifion — viz. a disposition duly prepared ^o yield to tte 
influence^-^the obsequiousness in a word — may not always ht 
capably of being produced in an instant, as in the case o{ 
casting of stampings biit may ndw and then require soidd 
length o{ tinit for the production of it, as in the caSe o{ 
modelling or sculpture. 

Jtlere then we see the difference between the drideni arid 
the modern contrivance for nullifying checks ^ and producing 
accepthbU ter diets. In the antient mode it was necesfaiy 
that, in the instance of each juryman, the disposit^ti to 
obsequiousness should be ready formed : on fh's' other hatfit, 
wherever this condition could be and was fulfilled, tfit 
business was the work but of an instant, hot was amy ap« 
plication of influence necessary to the accomplishment of 
It : in the modern mode it is not necessary, that the disposr^ 
tioh to obsequiousness should, in the first instance, be al- 
ready, as in the antient mode, completely formed ; nor ev^'A 
that, at that period, it should, in any degree, haVt; exist- 
ence : but what u necessary is, on the part of the situa-

tion in question, a considerable degree of permanence : un- 
derstand always eventual and defeasible permanence. 

The two modes stand thus discinsuished by the two dif- 
ferent principles, on which their efficiency respectively de- 
pends : the antient mode, by the principle Of choice — of 
selection — or, to call it by its established and proper name, the 
principle of package — simple package — package toties quoties^ 
and without need oV permanence : — the modern mode, by the 
principle of permanence: — ^thence package, once for all, and 
with the benefit of permanence. 

I In the last preceding chapter mention was made of the 
principle of mutation^ or continual change of persons, as 
one of the expedients employed in the original constitu- 
tion of juries, for enabling them to act with effect in the 
character in which they were destined to act, viz. that of a 
check upon the power of the judge; and, in that, view, for 
securing them against any sinister injluence by which the 
efficimcy of the check, so to be applied, might come to be 
impaired. The principle, here mentioned, under the name 
of^ the principle of permanence^ consists exactly, we see, in 
the absence or removal of that tutelary and fundamental 
principle. 

The principle of permanence being thus palpat)ly opposite 
to one of the essential and acknowledged principles of Jury 
trials to have established it directly and avowedly would have 
been plainly impracticable. For each court, for instance, a 
determinate number of jurymen, consisting of the number 
(twelve) necessary to compose a jury, with or without a few 
aupernumeraries, added for provision against accidents— to 
each juryman his situation, whether by salary or fees, ren^ 
dcred a desirable one — ^he, at the same time, pronounced re- 
moveable — avowedly removeable — at the pleasure of the 
judge or some other dependent of the crown ;— on any such 
plan, even in the most uninformed and incurious age, the 
continuing to the institution the name of jury would scarcely 
have sufficed to reconcile men to an arrangement so palpa- 
bly perverse— thus destructive of its manifest and mani- 
festly intended nature. 

When a determination to subvert, as far as it might be 
found practicable and convenient, this part of the constitu- 
tion had been taken, whatsoever were the contrivance em- 
ployed^ it was seen to be altogether necessary there should 
Dje some disguise or other put upon it. The business was 
neither to be attempted openly, nor all at once. 



§ 3- Corruption — Modes of applying it» 19 

Four distinguishatble conditions were seen to be neces- 
sary :— 1. Power ot nomination virtually in the hands of the 
Judge: — 2. Emolument, sufficient in magnitude^ and thence in 
ordinary duration, to render the situation an agreeable one» 
and thence the loss of it an object of apprehension i--^^ 
3. Power of amotion, viz. of removing a man from that 
situation, also virtually in the hands of the Judge t — 4. lu 
each case, the design so enveloped, as not to be seen 
through. All these points were accordingly accomplished. 

One point more required to be attended to. To have at* 
tempted to apply any such plan of deceit to all cases, and 
all at once, would have been incompatible with the success 
of it : — for, the effect being produced in every instance, the 
efficient principles would have burst through the disguise. 

Applied to all cases in which it was likely that the Judge, 
or any of the servants of the crown, his confederates, wwuld 
have any special interest, it would be sufficient to their 
purpose. To the object thus limited, the plan was accord'- 
mgly confined : and thus far it has been accordingly found 
to be but too practicable to carry the design into effect, and 
without prejudice to the disguise. 

Of all these several desiderata, the accomplishment will 
now be brought to view, as having been effected in and by 
the constitution of the sort, of body, termed a Special Jury : 
but, for the purpose of this exhibitiooi a separate chapter 
will be requisite. 

Compared with that mode, in which the principle em- 
ployed is no other than that ol simple package^ nobody, it is 
supposed, can be at a loss to see how prodigious the advaff- 
tage is which is gained by calling in the principle oi per» 
manence. In the way of simple package, extempore package, 
every thing requires to be done afresh each time: each time 
you have to hunt out for your men : and whereabouts are 
you, if so it be that at 'the moment none that will suit you 
are to be found ? • 

Apply the principle of permanence, there they are — your 
men — always at hand : and the longer you have had them 
where they are, the surer of them, on each occasion, you 
may be. 

Juries, packed in the old mode, are like wood-pigeons for 
which the woods must be hiinted ere they be in a state of 
requisition for the <?ook — or like those wild horses which a 
Spanish Creole has to scamper after in the plains ere he 
is in rgadiness to take bis ride. Juries packed in what will

be seen to be the new raode, packed with the adrantage of 
the principle of permanence^ are like pigeons taken out of a 
dove-house^ ^ or like those well-broken geldings which an 
Englishman keeps in his stable. 

In Juries^ in a word, permanence is exactly what it is in 
armies : it is the Work of the siame policy in both cases. It 
was, when as yet there were no standing armies^ that the 
coarse and precarious operation of extempore package, 
packing without the aid of permanence^ was employed in 
the case of juries. As our armies acquired their stability , 
so did our juries: and now that, under the pressure of na« 
tional necessity, our armies, strengthened by that principle, 
have swelled to %q unexampled a magnitude ; now it is, as 
will be seen, that without any such necessity, without any. 
other more cogent cause than convenience^ numbers in Juries 
not being susceptible of increase, this part of the establish'^ 
ment has received its improvement, and that to the degree 
of perfection that will be seen in the shape of permanence: 
say permanence^ but never without remembering the en- 
creased fsicilities it affords lor package. 

Convenience^ and nothing more. But what more war 
needful ? For it was the convenience, as we shall see, of 
Great Characters^ in those High Situations, in which, in tbe 
convenience of the individual, there is apt to be more of 
cogency than in the necessity of nations. 

At the outset, packing having been practised, when zi 
yet there was in j,urie» no such thing as permanence, the 
principle of package came unavoidably to be spoken of an- 
tecedently, and thu^ far in contradistinction to the princx- 
pit of permanence. But now, at this stage of the inquiry^ 
It will be sufficiently apparent (it is hoped) that of these two 
principles one is included in the other : and that, by the 
principle of permanence as applied to juries, is to be under- 
stood ^tfrman^nt^ and package together: package with the be- 
nefit of permanence, and permanence folr the purpose of 
package* 

^ ^. Deception^^Modes of applying it-^Instruments for 

the Application of it.

on the occasion which gave rise to this Kttle treatise, decep^ 
tion, an instrument not mcmt in: use on this occasion than on 



. § 4* Jicc^oH'^^Modes Mnd Instruments t m 

any other ; and the part here played by it no more than a 
subordinate one*-*^ yery slight mention of it will be suffi- 
cient here. Not that the mention of it will even here be 
altogether out of place, corruption having among its effects 
that of disposing a man not only to deceive others, but, 
moreover in the first place, and for the better quieting of 
bis own conscience, to deceive himself. ^ 

On the present occasion, so far as deception is concerned, 
ibe problem stands thus : — In cases where, if the conception 
entertained of the case by the jury were adequate, viz. comply 
and correct^ their will^ as declared by their verdict^ would 
be more or less apt to run counter to the ztnll of the 
judge^ so to order matters, as that by means of some want of 
completeness or correctness^ viz. on the part of the concep- 
tion entertained by them of that case, it may happen to their 
will to coincide with that of the judge. 
/ There are two ways, in either of which an efiPect thus 
desirable may be brought about. 

One is, by causing them to have a will, and that will 
exactly the same with that of the judge. 

The other is, by causing them not to have a will, viz. of 
their own (prming : of which state of mind the necessary 
consequen^ce will be their adopting^ without morie ado, what- 
soever will may come to be presented to them for that pur- 
pose by tl^ judge. ^ 

Of these two modes, this latter mode is by far the mo|t 
advantageous one. To the success of the former the crea- 
tive or sp^ial, it is necessary that fresh labour should be 
bestowed upon the subject on the occasion of every cause : 
by the other, the preventive or general mode, the business 
.is done once for all; and, without any fresh expence in the 
article of labour, a perpetually renewed harvest of success 
is reaped on the occasion of each individual cause :• in the 
. one case the business is carried on in the retail, in tlie other 
in the wholesale line. 

• In the case of corruption, the will of the party Corrupt* 
ed— here the jury, being formed by the will of the party 
by whom or for whose benefit the matter of corruption .is 
applied ; the state of the intellectual faculty is immaterial, 
nor is any sort of debility in it neces^ry to the production 
of the effect here supposed to be desired. 

But where, in a question of fact or law, a will of his own 
is to be formed by a man, who having no natural interest 



Jife Chap. III. The Check how done away by Ikjluence. 

^tit all in the business, has no interest at all in it, unless bjr 

•means of corruption he has a factitious one, he cannot 
have a will, other than one to the formation of which the 
use of the understanding is necessary : and thus it is, that, if 

•so it be that his own understanding is not, with relation to the 
matter in hand, in a state fit for use, that is, capable of being 
applied to vse, he is not only content but glad to borrow 
one of the judge, whose care it is that, under the cover 
of an act of the understanding, a wift of his own, more or 
less nicely folded up, shall be enclosed. 

By the understanding of a person placed in the situation 
of judge, an influence will of course be exercised over 
the understanding of every person standing in any such 
situation as that of juryman : and this influence, being on 

•all occasions applicable to all purposes good and bad, is 
thereby applicable to all bad ones. 

On this occasion the part which is open for deception to 
act is the giving to this influence a degree of strength be- 

:yohd what properly belongs to it — such a degree of strength 
as will enable it, upon occasion, on the spur of sinister in« 
terest or passion, to act with advantage in a direction oppo- 
site to that of the dictates of justice. 

In another work, [Scotch Reform, Letter li) it has al- 
ready been shewn how completely opposite the interest of 
^Xjudges^ commonly called by that name, as well as of 
all other men of law, has, throughout their whole field of 
action, all along been, and still continues to be, to the 
duty of judges, which is as much as to say to the interest of 
the peopU m respect of the ends of justice : not only this 

• fact, but the cause qf it, viz. an ill chosen mode of re- 
muneration, has in that same work been already brought to 
view. Of this opposition the cause and influence having 
as yet in a very small, if in any degree been understood, the 

• whole course of iNition of these functionaries has conse- 
quently been a course of deception : of deception practised 
throughout that whole course of action, on all sorts of occa- 
sions, and upon all sorts of persons : upon individuals at 
large, in their character of suitors: upon jurors, in particu- 
lar, in their character of jurors. 

Of the two modes of deception, special and general, the 

Smeral has already been shewn to be in every respect by far 
e most convenient with reference to the present purpose. 
^\%t gcncrar consists in forcing the people with wbQm 



\ 



^ 4. Dicepkon — Modes and Instruments^ S| 

you have to do, to borrow your understandings and, under 
the cover of it, your will^ by preventing them from havine 
any understanding fit for use, and thence from having any vnil 
applicable to the purpose. 

On this occasion the system of deception divides itself 
into two branches — the first consists in rendering the sub- 
ject—whatever it be, law, religion, any thing— in the pre- 
sent instance law, as incomprehensible, or (what is the per- 
fection of incomprehensibility) as uncognoscible as possible 
to all whom you h^ve to deal with, and that to their own 
conviction and satisfaction. 

The other consists in doing whatsoever the nature of the 
case admits of, towards raising in their minds, to as high a 
pitch as possible, the ^timate formed by them respectively 
olF the correctness and completeness of the knowledge pos- 
sessed by yourself in relation to the same subject. 

To the first end contribute, jargon, nonsense, absurdity, 
surplusage, needless complication, falsehood — every kind of 
intellectual nuisance, in every imaginable form : and this 
the higher in degree and greater in quantity the better, with- 
out any other restriction than what may be imposed by what- 
ever caution may be necessary to enable you to avoid coun« 
teractihg the other object last above-mentioned. 

Of these two branches of the art of deception, the first 
mentioned may be termed the depressive or humiliative^ the 
other the self-exaltative. 

The instruments applying or applicable to the purpose of 
deception, as above distmguished, may be the more readily 
comprehended by being distinguished into two classes. 
Those of the one may be termed the incorporeal instruments 
of deception : and though, upon a principle of division and 
nomenclature already attached to,^e subject, a complete 
enumeration of them would perhaps be scarce practicable, 
a tolerably sufficient sample of them Aas j ust been given ; 
viz. in the words jargon^ nonsense^ absurdity^ and so 
forth. 

For the designation of the instruments of the other class 
of these instruments, the term corporeal will of course pre- 
sent itself to the mifid of every man who has read Blacks- 
stone. 

Under the class of corporeal instruments may be com- 
prehended, besides the posts or other uprights by which 
the level of the bench is elevated above that of the jury-box^ 
the peculiar habiliments by which the profession and the 



B^ Chap. IIL The Check km ^^^ ^^^ fy Influence. 

o^ce together stand distinguished : outward and visiblj^i 
$igas of the inward and invisible graces and' virtues, Intel* 
lectual and moral, that dwell within. These last, in conside- 
ration of the incalculable influence which they are found to 
exert on the understanding of jurors and others, through the 
xnpdium of the imagination, may be moreover termed inr 
struments oi fascination: and as, amonff heathen statuaries, 
the circumstance of a man's having officiated with his own 
luods in the character of his own gpdmaker was not found 
to diminish hLs devotion towards such his God, so if, among 
the inhabitants of the same jury-box, it should happen to 
the ipakers of the several instruments of fascination, viz. 
t^e fuFrier, the taylor, and the peruke-maker, |o find them* 
selves assembled and met together, there seems no reason to 
suppose that, upon the minds of these several manufacturers, 
the influence of the several articles, in the character of in* 
struments of fascination, would £e less efficient than upon 
those of the other ** good men and true," their colleagues* 
Of these corporeal instruments the importance is the 

Sreater, inasmuch as but for them, and the fascination ^to^ 
uced by them, it seems not altogether easy to conceive, 
^^w the first branch of the art should have been compatible 
with the second, and how the stock of jargot^ nQi;isense, 
absifrdity, and so forth, how abundant soever, should 
have been conducive to, or even compatible with, the 
design of raising, in the minds of the persons concerned, the 
idea of the stock of real knowledge possessed by those ex- 
StUed characters by whom these incorporeal instruments of 
deception have ever been so liberally employed. 

Both sorts of instruments, incorporeal as well as corpo-* 
real, may moreover, if not in a strictly legal sense, as sa«* 
vouring r.ather of the pentenalty than the realty^ yet at any 
rate to a common inteA, be stiled and intitled heredita- 
mjents, % ^ 

In I elation to the corporeal hereditaments, the instru- 
ments of fascination, two things ought, notwithstanding, 
to be observed — one is, that the fascination performed is 
performed by the intrinsic and independent virtue of the 
ijistruments themselves, and that to the bearer, nothing 
being on his part performed, or necessary to be performed, 
tpwards and in relation to the effect, no part of the 
effect ou^ht to b,e ascribed or imputed : the other is, that 
were it not foi^ the evil company they are connected 
with, vifi*. that of ^e incorporeal instruments at)pve-.meu* 



§4* Dc^cphcn-^ldodes and hHnmeniSi aj| 

tioned, and the evil purposes to which the whole company 
are 80 unhappily .apt to, be, applied, the influence of thesq 
corporeal instruments, notwithstanding the name olfascina* 
iion so incontestibly belonging to it, might well be salutary 
and beneficial upon the whole. It is only by the abuse, in 
so far as abuse is made of them, that they operate in the cha. 
I2|qter of instruments of deception-'^he character in which 
t|key belong to the present purpose: and if these corpMreil 
were separated from the incorporeal instruments and heredi« 
timents above-mentioned, W^. the jargon, nonsense, and so 
forth, the abuse of the corporeal ones would be separated 
from the use. . 

. Of these several instruments of influence ta-whatsoever 
purpose applied, that of deception or any other, the eiB« 
ciency in tliat character will (it may be said) naturally be the 
same-— nearly if not exactly the same, whether, in the con« 
stitution of the jury in question, the principle of pernuu 
Bence be or. be not employed. 

This may Lc admitted. One means of influence however 
there remains, coming under the head of influence of un* 
derstanding on understanding, which is applicable with 
peculiar advantage to the purpose of deception, and which 
requires, as a necessary condition to its application, the ap- 
plication of the principle of permanence. 

When the judge and the jurymen become acquainted witb 
each others persons, being in a state of habitual intercourse^ 
a sort of connection, though it be but in the way of sym* 
pathy, grows up between them : a friendship which, though 
U he of that kind which has been called zjrieudship of m^ 
equality^ a friendship betwixt the superior and the inferior, 
Dfitwixt wisdom and simplicity, is not to this purpose at least 
the less powerful and effective. A look of complacency in. 
dicative bif old acquaintance and liuitual good understand, 
ing, descending, if ever the d]|||iit}r of ^he judge finds itself 
reduced to descend to such benignity, from the heights of 
the bench, upon the leading man in the jury box, the bell- 
wether is gained, the flock follow of , course. A sort of 
compact forms itself, under and in virtue of which the man 
of learning engages to afford direction, the child of sim* 
plicity to follow it: this compact once formed, the pre- 
tumj^tion, which on any particular occasion should presume 
to think and act for itself, would be ain act not only of teme- 
lity, hut of revolt and perfidy.

CHAP. IV. Special Juries, a Special Engine or 

Corruption. 

§ 1. Tlie System briefly stated. 

W£ have seen what expedients the nature of the case af« 
fordl^ for moulding juries into obsequiousness ^ principally 
\y means of corruption; and thus divesting, as much as may 
be, of all reality^ the appearance which they exhibit of a 
check to the arbitrary power of the judge. 

We now come to speak of the instrument or engine^ con* 
trived for that purpose ; applied to it, and to this day con* 
tinuing to be applied to it,' and with what disastrous success 
will be seen as we advance. This engine, in no small de«- 
gree a complicated one, is no other than the sort of jury 
termed a special jury. 

A special jury is so termed to distinguish it from a common 
jury: this last name being reserved for the designation of 
the only sort of jur)% which, till the invention of this spe- 
cial instrument of corruption, was in existence. 
. Above has been brought to view, in the character of a 
possible one, an arrangement, by means of which (bating 
such rare and casual exceptions as are liable to be now and 
then produced by the irregularities of the human mind) a 
body of men, be they who they may, may be brought into a 
state of constant and complete obsequiousness to the will of 
some person or persc^ns, (in the present instance the judge) 
between whom and them the requisite sort of relation has, 
in the manner there indicated, been established^ In the case 
of a special jury ^ this possible arrangement will be found to 
have been, and to remain to this day, completely realized. 

As of the true and original jury, so of this impdstrous 
modern substitute, tl^p ^n^tHflies buried in obscurity. Humau 
craft in every shape, and, in particular, in the shape of 
lawyer-craft — human-craft, like the mole, hides its ways from 
the light of day, and, as completely as possible, from human 
eyes. ^ 

The clearest view, as far as it goes, that we possess of this sort 
of jury, isthatwhicb is afforded to us by the statute-book .* and, 
in the statute-book, antecedently to the year 1730, being the 
third year of the last reign, no mention of it is to be foqndv 
In a statute passed in that year (3 Geo. 2. c. 25.) the sort of 
jury in question is spoken of, in the way of reference, as a

sort of tribunal actually in use : — finding it already in exist-' 
ence, all that the statute does with it is to regulate it. 

In the way of amendment, this act was, in the course of 
the same reign, followed by four others or parts of others: 
viz. 4 Geo. 2. c. 7^ 6 Geo. 2, c. 37. making perpetual 
3 Geo. %. c. 25; 24 Geo. 2. c. 18 ; 29 Geo. 2. c. 19.* 

In each judicatory [viz, in each of the three Westminster- 
hall jury .trial courts, King's Bench, Common Pleas, and 
Exchequer,) in the hands of an officer of the court, the 
right-hand man and dependent of the Chief Judge, t this 
cluster of acts (to consider them together) found the eflec- 
tive nomination of these assessors, by whose power that of 
the judge was in appearance to continue checked. Such arjB 
the hands in which King, Lords, and Commons found tift 
faculty of reducing to a shadow the controul supposed to be 
exercised by a jury: and in the same hands, under the 
direction of their learned and essentially treacherous guides, 
in these same hands it has been left.

the oldest book of practice, of which any mention is to bb found in the Law 
catalogues, is Powell's Attorney's Academy, London, 1623. 

In that book, no such appellation occurs as that of a special jury, p. 141.

as are employed to fill up casual deficiences in the number of special jurort: bat, 
at that time, they were but so many men taken (as their name imports) firam the 
hy-standers, to fill up the like deficiencies in the number of common jvrors, Oa 
this occasion mention may be seen made of an important office, viz. that of " 91^ 
tord^s Foot-Cloth Servant ;" who of course would not be left unprovided with 
his fee. And what would any one imagine was that fee ? Answer— Half as mtidi 
again as that of a regular juryman ; thrice as much as that of a t^lef-maru For the 
purpose of tracing out the first mention made of special juries, it would be met*

1623 and 1730.

9 fee, to an amount altogether uuUmiicd: whether it was or 
was not in their practice, qt in their power, to keep back 
Ibc fee, till after be had earnt it to their satistactioo, does 
iiot appear. 

In one of these acta, (24 Geo. a. c* t8. sec. 2.) reciting 
that " complaints are frequently made of the great and ex** 
•• travagant fees paid to jurymen under the authority of the 
*^ nii recited ixts," parliament did indeed attempt to limit 
(hit fee, utz. to the sum oi a guinea: but with how little sue 
f CSS may in due season be observed. (Part iiL cb» 2.) This 

Kinea, howeverj was not merely a guinea for each day of 
viee, but a guinea for each cause tried in the compass pf 
ibat day : and to the number of such causes there was no 
Cfitaio limit: nor therefore to the number of daily guineas.* 

§ 2« The Corruption briefly indicated. 

Such, so far as could be exhibited by a rough outline^ 
0ld Jipon a small scale, was and is the actual state of prac- 
tke. Now, in respect of such mattera as influence^ corrup^ 
tion^ and obsequiousness^ let ua, upon the same scale, ob« 
ierve the firuirs and consequences. 

. By means of the magnitude of tbe^^, and the situation of 
ik% oAndSx on which, on the . occasion of each in£,vidutd 
oaikS0^ it was thus made to depend by what individuals this 
mass of emolumeot should be received, a regulmr corps had 
thus gradually an^secretly been established, the members 
hominated in all cases by the dependent of the judge, that is 
IB effect by the judge bim9elf-*^p;iid in private causes by in* 
4ivtdiia)s, but in crown causes by the scrvamis of the crown: 
a body of troops, taking its orders, in private causes, from 
dbe judge alone^ in crotvn causes, also immediately from the 
judge, but in effect from the judge and the otUr servants 0/ 
Aitf ^own in conjunction, according to any agreement which 
in ieach instance it happened to them to have made. And thus 
it is Ihat, in a Westminster-hall court, in a crown cause, in-. 
dufling ahaast all causes in which the members of govern-

the defendant rests altogether in the hands of the dependent

from his sitnation*"— removed by an officer, who himself U 
liable, in the same manner, to be dismissed by the king at 
any of his servants, the dependence is commonly cM|^ 
dered as standing at the highest point in the scakf of t^t 
and perfect discipline. But a ]ponit still highet is OCCupiM 
by the sort ot dependence which, in the manner ite. hav6 
seen^ has place in the case of a special Juryman, fot^ by 
thd formality of express* dismission, the attention of thd 
public mind is naturally, with a degree of force depending 
on existing circumstances, pointed to the incident; and in 
Some cases, disapprobation from that quarter is in a gtt^Aei 
or less degree liable to be incurred: bnt, in the one ot t

X Ih Edmunds's Solicitor's Crtdde to the Practice of the Cfffice of Pleas in the 
Exchequer, London 1794, are divers Bills of Costs ; in one of which the case of 
a SffecitU Jury is introduced. In this part of the b^ll (p. 119} one of the items 
runs thus :— '^ Paid the Master" (the familiar name here given to the officer 
whose proper official tMe (See 27 Fmance Report, p. 210) is Deputy Clerk of the 
Pleas)—*** Paid- the Master, on naming the 48 special jurors, ^l. 2s." Another runs 
thus ir-** Attending and inqtdTiTig into the cojmections, &c, of the 48 juron, 
Cs, 8<2." These 48 are the 48 nominated by the Master Packer, and composing* 
as above explained, the gross occasional list, from which the deductions of 13, 
by the agents of the parties on Mch side, are allowed tp be made. But of whom 
should the inquiry be made but of die master packer, who is thus attended? For 
It is at Ids office that the several attendances charged in this part of the bill ase, 
eyery one of them, paid : and to what purpose rnalte the inquiry, if the official 
person of whom it is made were not, by his acquaintance with the *' comuc" 
Hans," &c. of these jurors, in a condition to answer it? PcMsessed of this 
knowledge, and therefore capable of giving the benefit of it to an such persons, 
in " high situation," to whom it may be agreeable to produce a proper title to it ? 
In " high situation," such, for example, as the constellation of luminaries, for 
the barking at whom Mr. Cobbett and Mr. Justice Johnson were prosecuted and 
convicted. See further on chap. 8.^Note, that, in this Bill qf Costs, the cause 
is supposed to be a country cause : yet, for learning the ** connections,** &c. of 
tilt jurors, it is not in the country, where their residence is, but m town, vtx. at

tinguished by the name of the gross occasional list. ^

or parties on each side of the cause, has the power of dis- 
carding 12 : which faculty, (the agent having of course his 
fees for it) will, in the natural order of things, of course be 
exercised.t But if, to this natural order of things so, on 
any occasion, it should happen, that an exception should 
take place, then, and in such case, it is by the master 
packer that the defect is supplied, and the operation oi dis- 
carding performed. 

. 5. Be this as it may, of the remaining 24 is constituted 
what may be termed tne reduced list. 

Of each of these 24 the attendance is, or at least ousht to 
be, required by the sheriff by a summons^ issued in obedience 
to an order ox precept^ which contains the whole reduced list^. 
and has been previously transmitted to him from the court. 

6. Tha number actually serving on a jury being no more 
than 12,- the object in view in summoning the 24 is to 
secure the appearance of half that number* Ot those 
who, oh any given occasion, actually make their appear- 
ance accordingly, the. list may be termed the actually ap^ 
pearing or attending list,

whose names stand first upoji the reduced list, are the 12 
that serve. Of these the list may be termed the serving

Two other sources require here to be brought to view, 
from which the completeness and abjectness of dependence, 
and the correspondent arbitrariness of the correlative power, 
are capable of receiving increase: i. The Jacihty and sect^» 
rity, with which the correspondent power created by such 
dependence is capable of being exercised: 2. The nttmber 
of ihe persons^ by any one of whom the power in ques* 
tion is, with that same degree of facility, capable of being 
exercised over the one dependant in questibn. On both 
these Accounts may be seen, in the instance of the Guinea 
corps, a degree of dependence — in that of their secret rulers 
a degree of arUtrary power — such as it may not be easy to 
match in any other instance. 

Consider, in the first place, the number and quality of 
. the persons, in whom the dependant will be apt to view the 
arbiters of his fate. Visible and immediate possessors of this 
power, two — and two only: these will be, in the first in- 
stance, the master packer by whom the gross occasional 
list is formed — and, in a crown case, the crown soli- 
citor by whom the candidate for a place in the serving list 
IS liable to be discarded. 

But these are not, either of them, persons by whom, in 
case of any sinister interest, the original sinister interest 
will naturally be possessed: it is from other persons behind 
the curtain^ persons in quality and number unknowq to the 
continually, employment-seeking and everlastingly-depen- 
dent guinea-man, that, in case of any such sinister interest, 
aud corresponding notification of superior will, those osten" 
jilflc and apparent officers will have taken their direction or 
their cue. fa these unknown occupants of the region 
situated behind the curtain, the trembling guinea*man will 
behold so many phantoms, to the zoill of every one of 
which, so far as it can be guessed at, and to him presents 
itself as reconcileable with that of the rest, it will be ne- 
cessary for him to shape his part in the verdict. Among 
half a dozen of these high-seated spectres, lo ^ve, for ex- 
ample, the verdict he joins in may, in his conception, be 

assures us, p. 173, been received, soliciting to be put upon " what they called 
the special jury list." All these from persons termed by him ** respectable per-

matter of indifference. No matter : if to the remaining 
sixth it be matter of anxiety, the liberty of the guinea-man 
is as effectually killed by this single one, as it could have 
been by all six. 

Meantime neither with any of the phantoms behind the 
curtain, nor with either of the two masses of human flesh 
subsisting, is it possible for the guinea-man ever to come tQ 
any sort of explanation. With the right-hand man of the 
judge it is scarce possible, witb the crown solicitor it* is 
neither necessary nor natural, that he should ever have any 
sort of intercourse. His sin, the joining in a wrong ver- 
dict, is committed openly in the jury -box : his punishment- 
removal out of the select qualified list, will be inflicted in 
secret : yea, and so secret, as not to be at any determi- 
nate time made known even to the sinner himself. Of- 
fended powers inexorable, were it only because uncognosci« 
ble: repentance rendered utterly unavailing by the very 
nature of the case.* 

Think now of the facility and security, with which the 
correspondent power, created by this sort of dependence^ 
may be, aye, and ever must be, exercised. Say rather^ 
profited by, without being exercised. To powers that «need 
never make their appearance, neither action, no, nor so much 
9is existence, is necessary to the production of the most un- 
deserved obedience : existence sufficient to the purpose is 
lent to them by the dependant's fears. On the paft 
of the invisible potentate, no previous Mandamus, no Let^ 
ires dc Jfussion ar6 ever necessary : the effect is produced 
without an atom of responsibility in any such high quarter, 
in any the slightest shape. 

How delightful, yes, even in comparison of what it is at 

present, would be the situation of z Chancellor of the Exche-^ 

' quer, were the corps under his command subject to an 

eqtkally efficient Mutiny law, ^nd thende in a state of equally 

perfect discipline. No need of letters, np nor so much as

Hot then be so pungent, but that it might be ** in thepotuer

How perfect soever the discipline of this corps, I speak 
0f the Guined ^orps^ may be at present, its existence in any 
atiich degree of perfection tannot have been , of any very 
antieM date. Pdint d'argcnl^ point de Stdsse. Before the 
situaciOki was capable of being moulded into an instrument 
of coiitiption, an efficient cause of sure 6bsequiousMsfs«^-^ , 
it was necessary that a quantity of saccarine matter, sufi- 
cietiit for the dulcification of it, should have been secreted 
, Xttd combined with it. But, even at present, keen and 
numerous as we have seen the appetites to be that are ek« 
cixed by that maitteir, the quantity of it furnished in a year 
, is no greater (I speak always of Middlesex) than that wnich 
is extracted from sod causes. 

At present, as already observed, the whole of the^^ji 
teendoftUtl list (48) beiiig, oh the occasion of each cause, 
chosen in the first instance by the master packer^ all tak^n. 
but of the select and secret list^ with whose *' connections^ * 
&c." he is so perfectly well acquainted ; — in this regular 
afnd wdl'Ordered state of things, whiqh of them are left to 
^constitute the reduced list^ (24) of whom the la whose 
names stand Ifirst upon the appearing list will constitute the 
serving list^ will, to him and his high-seated superiors, be, 
as already observed, matter of complete indifference^ But 
i(t an early period of the special jury system, no such entire 
security could have been possessed. Of those with whose 
tiispositions he was sufficiently acquainted, they being at the 
jsame time such on whom, {/'attending and serving, depen- 
dence might be placed, there might not be above a dozen 
of whdse attendance he could be sure, and of the whole of 
this dozen, supposing the right of discarding exercised, he 
might find himseA' deprived. In such a atate of tfamgs, 
the command of a verdict, even from special jurymen, 
^cemfs to have been matter of artxiety : ana though, when 
once established, the faculty of discarding could not, as it 
was thought, consistently witl) .prudenoe, be dMoluiely

taken away, yet what in this way was thouglu capal^k of 
being done^ without a too complete removal of the JBmk$ 
a too bare-faced apt of injustice, was done. 

Accordingly, in the 3d of King William, anno 1^90, 
Molt being Lord Chief Justice of the Xw*s B^nck^ " a 
standing regulation, if not at t^at tiaie m^% was dk s^ny 
l^ate found to be in existence :* a r^ulatiq^ wbereby it. wn 
j^ovided, that unless a special order we^Q made fqr th^ pw^ 
pose, giving to the parties on both sides, and consequeistfly 
to the defendant, that faculty, it should not be exercife4: 
but the nomination should be compUafed as well ^s iegu% 
%y the o%tiBt of the court, the sutordinaU pf the then r<u 
moveaUe and completely dependent judge.t 

Thus the ordinary course ^f practice at that lime was— * 
not to allow any such faculty; and it was only where, hav^ 
ing been importuned for, it could not for shame be re* 
fused, that it was granted. 

Throughout the system of technical practice , so universe 
is the practice of misrepresentation and deceit, that it is nvUI«r 
of continual uncertainty by what hand this or that branch of 
business is actually performed. Thus, in Equity practice^ 
of the mass of business stated in the books as being per* 
formed by the Master, an indefinite and ever variable pro* 
portion is really performed by some clerk of his, the mat- 
ter knowing nothing of the matter. In any of these offieea»,

life, and who, attired in such resplendent robes, takes in

was performed, the powh exercised, a power over the pro* 
perty of suitors to any amount in point of importance, ex« 
ercised — not by this learned person, but by some underling 
who is known to nobody, whose name appears no where, 
and who being there to day, may be gone to-morrow. 

Thus in the case of the jury-packing business. In every 
of the five packing offices but one, the person by whom 
the business is done is, in the several books of practice 
above referred to, gravely stated as being thi master : and, 
in each of thos« four instances, so it may be or may aot be. 
But in one of them, viz. in the King's Bench office^ crozvn 
side^ of the practice of which there was no account tiH 
so late as in the year 1805 the public happened to be fa- 
voured with one by Mr, //iwrfj, the packing business, it 
appears, (p. 10) is performed, as it may happen, sometimes 
by the master sometimes by his clerk. 

This being the case in a crown cause, a libel cause for 
example, whosoever it may happen to, to sec reason for 
wishing to make himself master of that useful article of 
knowledge, which, in the Exchequer, according to Mr, 
£dmunds, as above, persons concerned arc so regularly so- 
licitous to acquire, viz. information concerning the ** con- 
nections, &c.'* of persons qualified for being special jurors, 
(las his choice of two of these intelligence-offices, one of 
them inferior in dignity, and thence perhaps superior in obsc^ 
guiousness and tractahiHty^ to what is likely to be commonly 
known or imagined. 

• For, according to Mr. Hands, (p. 10) after '* the solid- 
tor has got the master's appointment on the rule to name 

the jury*' it is ** the master's clerk" that '* -extracts, 

out of the sheriff's book of jurors, the names and additions 
of forty-eight :*' and afterwards, •* if either party does not 
attend the master's appointment,'* it is ^' the master or his 

clerk" that *' strikes out for the absent party.*'

§5- Aggregate Mischief of the System,. 

Of the mischief capable of resulting to the country from 
the application of this engine of sinister influence, the 
^quantity will, of course, depend on the extent of which 
^the application of the instrument is susceptible.

of Jmy trial : at least with that of jury trial in causes origi- 
nating in any of the great Westminster-hall courts. On 
every occasion it rests with either party to have a special 
jul-y for asking for.* What is reserved to the court is only 
Co say, and that at a subsequent stage, by which of the par- 
ties the extra expence shall be borne. Among the causes in* 
which the king is nominally the plaintiff — in those. to which 
the name of crewn causes is more commonly understood as 
being confined — I mean those in which the servants of the 
crown, as such, being substantially prosecutors, having the 
prosecution, upder their care — the expence being borne out 
ofq^he taxe^ all causes, it may well be imagined, become 
special jury causes : and among these are King's Bench libel, 
taw causes, and, in comparison of these, (of which presently), 
all other crown causes will, to the purpose here in question, 
be seen to be of light importance. 

And here then we have not only the possible and proba-. 
ble, but actual extent of* sinister influence. ? 

Of the sinister influence of which the institution of ' 
special juries is thus the engine, iht local sphere h indeed 
confined, perhaps at least in a great degree, within the 
bounds of London and Middlesex, But, by causes not ne*^ 
cessary > to be here particularized, within this sphere are 
brought, with scarce an exception, all causes that belong 
to this most important class. 

But this mischief, though the principal^ forms but one in-- 
gredient, in a compound mass of mischief, in which, at 
least, four distinguishable component elements may be 
reckoned up. 

1. First comes the injustice — the base and sordid injus* 
lice — out'of the common pockets of rich and poor, an al* 
lowance given by the rich to the rich, in compensation for 
a burthen which, to those to whom the compensation is ^ 
given, is as nothing, but, to those to whom compensation ' 
is refused, a serious one.t

f In 1778, so considerable was the pressure of that vexation and ezpenoe| 
that for a long course of years a species of traffic that had been invented by one 
of the baili& to the sheriff of Middlesex, viz. the taU of a specieg of mdul- 
gencet, exempting men from that burthen, had composed a regular branch of 
his revenue. Having been proceeded against in the way of attachment, as for x 
contempt of the authority of the codrt, and selfi<X)nvicted by answers to' inter- 
ro^toriesy he was sentenced to pay a fine of 3002. and committed to prison^

and though not altogether wkhout ihtfornud allowance^ yet

to a purpose undeniably hostile^ and in its imdl^wfy-— aad, if 
nm remedied, in its sure ultimate effect, destructive to the 
constitution ; destroyirvg altogether to the ext^it of its in-

When the class or rank in society, to which a man belongs, is to a certaio 
jdeyee inferior, his interest has either no claim to any degree of consideration, 
or, if to any, to none but a proportionably inferior degree of consideration : 
triien his rank in society rises to a certain level, his claim to have his interest 
taken, to this or that effect, for an object of consideration, rises along with it, 
Sdch is the maxim which, £rom the earliest times down to the present indnaive, 
hUx though seldom very explicitly avowed, been not the less steadily and ex- 
tensively acted upon and approved. 

A coRetrtioti of the instances, in which this maxim has lecetved its applies*- 
ttofi, would be no uninteresting article; no unfit object, one of these days, for 
|||e industry of a c9mmiUce, In the statute book they might be found in deplo- 
able ahundance. Ilie present Instance may serve for one. Of the extra aptv- 
htde looked out for, as above, the only criterioa employed was extra ofulence, 
To leave without compensation for this burthen that great mass of qualified per- 
ims, who, in comparison, were least able to bear it, was no injustice : to leavo 
^■Hhout compensation men selected for their extra opulence, distinguished by no 
•thei made tlian that opulence, and thence by their superior ability to bear thf 
Imrthen, wovld have been an intolerable injustice. To comtnon jurymen accord>

4. Lastly — though, after tnention of the preceding^ abuse^ 
the mention of this last is but an anticlimax, comes the 
facility which, by the permanence already become notori- 
ous* is afforded to the casual corruptor : to any individual 
to whose improbity it may occur to take advantage of the 
facility thus afforded. 

To extinguish this facility, was the declared and priiicL- 
pa) object Of the first of the series of statutes above-men-; 
tioned; decWed in two places, (3 Geo. 3. c. sj. ^ i. ^ 4^.] 
Corruption ^jurors is, in the ^rst of the two places, 
spoken of as the notorious effect: permanence^ the conti* 
nuance of the same man in that situation,, is in the last of 
the two places spoken of as the cause.* 



* Let oot 9Qy such misooncq^tioo ta|K place, as that it is among the desigof 
of these pa^ to present, in any unfkvourable point of view, if individually 
taken, the diameters of such persons to whose names it happens to have a place 
iia thi Dumtfoos list in question: 1 mean the aggregate list of persons, to ibft 
■Kimberof aWntt4/CK>, set down w the books as 91MIJSM tp serve as special ju^. 
men in the cpijnty of Middlesex. Anoong them the only persons, to whom se 
much as the shadow of suspicion can attach, are those, if any such there be, 
whose names have been placed upon the select qtmfified list: and of these the 
names are necessarily a «eeref— and that not only to itiepul;Hc at large, but, in 
nuuiy iiistwi09» perhafis, to tkemieiffes. 

Thus much, however, seems scarcely to be open to dispute ; «ts» diat thif

to know, that in that whole list so much as a single person deficient in cither of 
those respects would be to be found : all I mean to say is, that if any such pef- 
fOA pr peisoDS do ezist'>-if, in the whole qualified Kst any such peccant matter 
h»iK eiVStcBOe, the select as^d^se^et list, if any such there be, cannot but, of^I 
p\Mce% be the prpperest place to look for it. For in the character of an adequate 
substitute to all other requisites, stands this one, viz. obsequiousness: obsequi- 
ousness, experienced ot presumable. But to make proof either of eMs, or of any 
other, qualiftcation, 10 no one of them, unless it be the foreman, can it ever be 
necessary, so much as to open his lips : no, nor to give any sign of life, other 
than an assenting nod. Neither by vmprolnly in any shape, so long as it be not

§ 6. Views of the Lawyers who penned the Acts. 

< 

The confirmation civen by the series of statutes, all of 
them statutes of the last reign, to the use made of special ' 
juries, this confirmation, and the prodigious extent to which 
the practice has in consequence been spread, have been aU 
ready mentioned. 

Of the lawyers with whom this series of statutes origi- 
nated, or through whose hands it passed, the treacherous- 
sess, though in this, any more than in any othpr, instance, 
treacherous ness of this sort ought not to extite surprize, 
has not tl\e less claim to notice. 

The everlastingly vaunted use, and, if not the sole, at 
least by far the principal use of juries, was the serving as a 
check to arbitrary power that otherwise would have been in 
the hands of judges. But, the mode of appointment con. 
sidered, in proportion to the extent to which it prevailed, 
by the substitution of this new-invented to the original 
species of jury the efficiency of this check was, in the first 
instance, greatly debilitated, and left exposed to be at any 
time utterly destroyed. For the healing of the wound thus 
given to the constitution, nothing whatever was done by 
these unfaithful trustees and utiworthy representatives of 
the people. 

In the hands of the dependant subordinate of the judge, 
to whose power the function of those his assessors was in 
pretence designed to operate as a check, these pretended 
reformers found the nomination of those same assessors : — 
in those bands they found it, and in those same hands they 
left it. 

By such practised eyes i\\e fraud was by far too palpa- 
ble to have passed unnoticed. As to the remedy nothmg 
could have been more obvious. In a selection made by 
human judgment, under the influence of human selfishness 
and improbity, there was in any hands more or less danger : 

their worthlcssness', be not notorious, the most worthless. What more promis- 
ing instrument can power wish for when placed in weak or wicked hands? To 
the case of country causes, so much of the mischief of this institution as is 
confined to the anticonstitutional abuse has comparatively but little application. 
The great theatre in the metropolis enjoys almost a moxu)poly of the political 
jibel law causes, 



§ 6. Views of the Lawyers who penned the Acts. ^j 

a selection made, in the first instance, by chance, corrected 
afterwards by hunaian judgment, under the influence of im^ 
partiality, a neutral power, formed by the con^bination of 
opposite partialities, there could be no such danger. The 
expedient was top much in use, and too obvious, to escape 
notice. Use will be made of it further on in the composi- 
tion of the proposed remedy. 

The extent they found it occupying, (I mean the speciat 
, jury system) was not only bounded but extremely narrow. 
They rendered it boundless : and, by this new fangled and 
corruptly constituted tribunal, all causes that are considered 
as coming under the denomination of important ones, have 
accordingly been swallowed up. ' 

To the party in the wron^, to the mala fide suitor, as 
often as he sees his advantage in substituting, they gave the 
power, the indefeasible power, of substituting this uncon- 
stitutional tribunal to the old constitutional one; and, 
amongst others, to the servants of the crown, and to the 
judges themselves, as often as it should happen \,o them, to 
nave any malevolent passion to gratify, or any sinister inte- 
rest ^o promote, at the expence of justice. 

Giving to their new tribunal a character so different from, 
that of the old one, which it has to so great a degree el- 
bowed out — giving to a Board, secretly composed of com-r 
missioners, paid, placed, and displaceable by the servant! 
of the crown, the respected and almost sacred name ot 
Jfury^ they thus contrived to transfer, to the counterfeit in« 
stitution, all that attachment and confidence, so justly pos- 
\sessed by the genuine one which it supplants. 

Finally, nor, in the extent, as well as confirmation, given to 
this abuse, did they forget, that which Judge and Co. never 
haye forgotten, profit to their own firm,*

§ 1 . The E^ct rf Ccrrvftion how secured iy it. 4^ 

But for this feature, for any purpose of corruption, a «a- 
jority, or at least hajf of the le, all corrupted, would have 
been necessary : under and by virtue of this feature, one, 
any one, gained and properly armed, armed with the ne« 
cessary degree of patience^ suffices. 

If the mode c^ forming verdicts had been the work q£ 
calm reflection, working by the light of experience, in a com^ 
paratively mature and enlightened age, some number, certaia 
of affording a majority on one side, viz. an odd mimber« 
would, on this as on other occasions, faav% been provided; 
and to the decision of that preponderating number 
would of course have been given the effect of the con- 
junct decision of the whole : witness the course takea for 
securing a decision under the GrenviUe Act. 

But the age in which the mode of forming verdicts was 
settled, being an age of remote antiquity^ of such high an* 
tiquity, that nothing more is known of it, except that it 
was an age of gross and cruel barbarism, the course taken 
for the adjustment of that operation was different, and, ooni« 
pared with any thing that was ever exhibited in any other 
nation, no less elctraordinary than it was barbarous. Tbe 
whole body of these assessors, twelve in number, being 
confined together in a certain situation, and in tliat situation 
subjected to a mode of treatment, under which, unless in 
time relieved from it, they would, at the end of a more or 
less protracted course of torture, be sure to perish : sub* 
jected to this torture, but in the case of this as of other 
torture, with power to relieve themselves from it: in tbe 
. tnresent instance by declaring, each of them, the fact oC 
iiis ^entertaining a certain persuasion {^t persuasion ex« 
pressed by their common verdict) whether really entertained 
oy him or not:^iti this way it was that a joint decision, 
called a verdict, expressed by a predetermined word or form 
of words, was on each, and every occasion, extorted from 
the whole twelve. Such, for the declared purpose of se« 
cwxm^iruth, veracity ^ ver^ dicta, for making sure that, on the 
fort ef occasion in question, whatever declarations of opi* 
nton came to be made should be true — such was tbe ex|i«* 
dientinvented in the 13th or 14th century— such the course 
which StiU m the nineteerith continues to be pursued. 

Here th^, as often as in the number of twtlve jurors, 
any difference of opinion has had place, so often has 
tn act of wilful fal^bood, . of mcndacitf , faul palace t 



46 Chap. V. Jury Unanimity increases the Cdrruption* 

viz. in the instance of some number, from one to elevcit, 
included in the twelve, if nol (as in the case of sinister 
influence may at any time happen) in the instance of all 
twelve. For that it is in the nature or power of torture 
—one and the same torture — as being applied at the same 
time and place to twelve persons, A, B, C, D, and so 
forth, to produce a real change of opinion in any one 
of them— or if it were, to render it more likely, that the 
opinion of A, should change into that of B, than that oV 
B, into that of A, and so forth-— is a proposition which, 
upon reflection, will not, it is supposed, easily find any 
person either to sign or so much as seriously to say it: 
excepting always the case of his being placed under the 
action of any of those machines for the production oi peace ^ 
concord^ unanimity^ «r timformity, under the pressure of 
which any thing whatsoever — any one thing as well as any 
other, is either said or signed. 

But though what never can happen is, that by a quantity 
of bodily pain or uneasiness, any real change should bff 
produced in the opinion formed by any human being on a 
subject that has no natural connection with that pain or un- 
casmess, yet what may very easily, and will naturally hap- 
pen is, that either by the eventual assurance of any given 
quantity of pleasure, or what comes to the same thing by 
the assurance of having at command a given quantity of 
the instruments of pleasure in any shape — or by the even- 
tual apprehension of any given quantity of pain or uneasi' 
ness — a disposition may, in a bosom soothed with that as^ 
surance, or galled by that apprehension, be produced — a 
disposition — yes, and moreover an effective determination — 
ftubmit t® that pain, for a greater length of time than any 
during which the same pain will be submitted to by a 
bosom not acted upon in either way as above. 

From this state of things follow two practical results — 

1.^ Suppose no sinister influence (mz. of will over will) to 
have place, the verdict will always 'be conformable to the 
opinion declared by that one of the jurors, in whose bosom 
the prospect of the uneasiness to which, until the forma- 
tion of the verdict, they will all be subjected, operates with 
least force — more shortly, by him whose sensibility to the 
torture is least acute: — whose power of endurance h greatest. 

2. Suppose any sinister influence to have place — an in-' 
fluence acting on the bosoms of any one or more of them 



§ 2. Corrupiorst regular er casual. 47 

iil the same direction — while no sinister influence has plaCe 
m the bosoms of any of the rest ; — there are two caseg, in 
each of which the efficiency of the sinister influence, and 
the delivery of a corresponding verdict, will take place of 
course: — viz. if on both sides, the power of endurance 
(with reference to the torture) be equal; or if in the bosom 
operated on by the sinister influence in question (say the 
fear of losing the situation at the guinea bo^rd) the force of 
the fear produced by the sinister influence be any thing* 
more than equal to tlie quantity by which what would 
otherwise be the power of endurance on that side falls 
short of the actual power of endurance on the other* 



I 2. Corrupters^ regular or casual — both served by Una- 
nimity. 

Two sorts of corruptors have above been indicated and 
distinguished : the regular corrupter, judge and Co. ; the 
casual corrupter, any individual^ to whom it may occur to 
take advantage of the facilities, afforded by the institution 
of the guinea corps, for securing a verdict favourable to his 
cause* 

In whatsoever shape^ and from whatsoever quarter^ the 
matter of corruption be proposed to be administered, for 
securing the effect of it, no other contrivance so effectual 
as this of unanimity — forced and mendacious unanimity — 
could possibly have been devised. 

On so simple and easy a condition, as the being pre- 
pared to endure, longer than any of his fellows, a degree 
of bodily inconvenience which no persons so circum- 
stanced were ever known to endure long, it gives to any 
one of these jurors, that chooses thus to purchase it, the 
power of all twelve. 

Two different sorts of causes, each with its appropriate 
judicatory, may serve as examples of the assistance deriva- 
ble by the two different species of corrupters from this one 
common source, 

1 • A political libel cause — sole j udicatory the King^s Bench-^

ef technical procedure in practice, almost sole judicatory^ 
the £xchequer*-is. Under the invitation held out by Ibe 
pemument estahlisho^nt of the Guinea corps, in a peculiar 
iegree adapted to the finding exercise tor the dexterity of 
the casual corruftor. 

His solicitor (for, when the disposition to corrupt and 
ke corrupted ia banished frotn the Treasury Bench, it will 
be time enough for a smuggler to despair of meetifig widi 
it upon the roll of attornics) his solicitor (the same sort of 
gentleman who, a few years ago, would have answered to 
the name of attorney) pursuing the instructions given to 
him as above by M.x .Solicitor Edmunds ^ (p. 119) " attends** 
.at one of ih^ Jive packing offices above-mentioned, addresses 
himself according to circumstances either to the acting 
master packer himself, or to the clerk, who to this purpose 
officiates occasionally as the master packer's de^uty-^^^ad, 
accordfrflg to instruction, as above, makes his '* inquiriea 
into the connections, &c. of the jurors.'' ..,.,. 

Alas ! what a round-about course is this J was about at* 
tempting to delineate ! As if a solicitor in the smu^liog 
Jine did not know his duty* 

The duty of an advocate is to take fees, and in return for 
those fees to display to the utmost advantage whatsoever 
ialshoods the solicitor has put into his brief : the duty of the 
solicitor is to put into such his brief whatsoever falsehoods 
ftf^mise to h^ so made use of to the best advantage. It is 
for this amongst other purposes, viz, for giving scppe and 
^ect to such* falsehoods, that, hy^ law of the modem Meda 
wid FersiamSs suitors stand for ever excluded from the pre- 
sence of the judge. 

In the great system of delinquency, the smuggleh 
Jbcanch, as it has its principals , viz, the smi^Iers themselves 
who are called by that name, so has it amongst its accessor 
Ties^ts licenced accessaries after the fact^-tbe learned 
aiders^ abettors^ receivers, and comforters, of the a{(Mresaid 
*amuggfers. 

Iti virtue of that diuision of labour, which, by the for- 
tuitous concourse of talents, disposition, and opportunities, 
iui boen produced in the Court of £xch^qu€!r, besides ad-

locales of the inferior order, there is always a title-gowns- 
man or two> regularly established, as any body may see, in 
the smutting line, ,^ 

Can it be otherwise among solicitors ?* 

In the case of any or each such solicitor, let us then make 
that supposition, the contrary of which would be alike in-* 
▼idious and unnatural : let vs suppose him to know, and 
knowing, to fulfil, in this behalf, his duty: his duty towards 
num: and, of his duty towards man, that -more specially 
imperative branch, which is composed of his duty towards 
ike smuggler. 

> In speaking of the Master Packer, and his lists, a list 
metitioned— as one that he ought to have, and having to 
keep hung up, is (speaking of special jurors) the Gross qua^ 
lifiedlisi; — as a list which it is natural he should have, but 
not natural that he should keep hung up, another under the 
name of the SeUct and Secret qualtfiea list, or to give it its' 
other denomination, the Guinea corps. 

The solicitor in the smuggling line, can he be said to ful- 
fill his dutv as towards each, or ^ny of his clients, if he 
has not, either in his bureau or in his head, a list of the 
several members of this corps — as correct and complete as it 
is in the power of " inquiry'* and industry to make it ? 

If in the whole flock of Guinea-men th^re be but a 
single scabby sheep to be .found, that one individual sheep 
is his man: — under the unanimity . system, that one indivi- 
dual secures tlie verdict. 

As to the arguments by which he, whose duty it is to 
ofer the bribe, satisfies the conscience of the habitually ob- 
sequious guinea-man of its being his duty to accept it, 
any attempt to display them in doKil would be alike super- 
fluous and irrelevant. Necessity of smuggling — impossibility 
4fF carrying on trade without it — irtformers, perjurers — never 
ielieve one of the?n — prosecution is persecution. , . . 
. Is it for any such purpose as that ^biassing a gentleman's 
judgment, that the little compliment — the small retribution for 
his trouble — is ready to be presented? Good heavens! no! — it 
is*4mly to engage his attention — his strict and unbiassed atten^ 
tion — of which his detection of the system of perjury, xtikick it 
is known will be brought forward, will be the certain conse^^ 
quence 

But to what jpurpose go on encumbering the section an)r 
further with any the slightest hints ? Our solicitor has heard 
with due attention the speeches delivered from Isarned silk :

Well, Sir^ we w^n't differ about names : if corruptioti i# 
not to your taste, let us say influence :^— and pruy, Sif^ #er6'd 
the difference ? ' 

But, in one and the same cause, suppose the tegulut 
cdmiptor on one side, and the casual corruptor dtt the 
other:— in ft case of this sort, ho^ will the ifh^tter bi 
settled? 

Fret not thyself, about any such cdSe : it is a case that, 
can never happen: nor, if it wfcre to happen; would Ihfer* 
be any difficulty in it* 

In thb libel tine it can never happen : for, as every ihan 
that either writes or reads h hj law a libeller, there h no 
such a person as a j(?/2aV(7r specially established iti the libet 
line. The regular corruptor — or rather the phantom of the 
regular corruptor- — for, (as we have seen) the phantom it 
quite sufficient— -*this regi^ phantom, having here no com- 
petitor, walks over the cdHrse. 

In the smuggling Hne, it can almost as little happen. Th^ 
solicitor for the smuggler is solicitous for the smuggler, ie- 
cause, and in so Jar as, in being solicitous for his client, he 
!s solicitous for himse^. Hete then We have the c^iti^ ter- 
ruptor. The solicitor foir the croum is not solicitous for 
what is called the croum: his Solicitude, if he httb ^ny^ 
is more likely to be for the smuggler: because the thoh! Off 
them escape a first time, the more there are that rettlain U^ 
be prosecuted a second time ; and whether the smuggler h^ 
caught or escape, the solicitor remains solicitor as befdf^^ 

Here then, provided the fee be handsome enough (for 
proportions, it will be %een, mu^t not be fdrgotten)^«^hete {%,

In the Guinea trade, as in any other trade, they would ha 
settled upon the principles of trade. Compliment oflfered, so 
much down. • Per contrH, on taking j/^^ri,- situation in she 
Guinea trade, gross value, so much: situation not being in« 
sorable, either at the Equitable or the Amicabk, say loss of 
value, by peril of false brethren, and shipwrecKi in case of 
nan^oisequtausnisSt so much: balance, for of againsi ac-^ 
ei^ting compliment, . so much. 

Bui at this rate ^says somebody) toe should have bonghe 
aeqnittals, especialfy in smuggling causes, as plenty as shim 
pleas or sham bail-^^W of any such d^ree (f frequency, or 
any thing approaching to it, are any indications to he/bund? 

Have patience :— things mast have time to ripen. It is only 
trithin these J^ years, and under the auspices of the preseni 
learned Chief, that the system has been raised to that height 
in the scale of perfection, at which it will presently be seen 
to stand. Earth must h^ve time to brinj^ forth her increiisei 
especially in such a field as that of judicature, where if, oC 
those things which yield profit to the husbandman, the 
growth of every thing is sure, yet even of those things the 
growth cyf almost every thing is slow. 

True it is, that, after fighting off till judgment, the smnd^ 
In', with another man's money in his pocKet, goes to ^Al 
^( iht twelve Judges in the Exchequer Chamber, oitio four 
of them in the Kxng's Bench, as the case may be^ and says 
to them, (they appearing in the only mode of appearanu 
which they admit of, viz. by this or that ^^^/ of theirs.) The 
delay you have upon sale is cut out, I find, in pieces much 
of a length, let me have one of the longest: make out your 
account: I know you deal for nothing but ready money : here 
ii is for you. Here we see perfection^^he very summit of. 
the scale. 

Expect not however that at the Guinea office, even at 
that which is under the Exchequer, business of this sort

should, at so early a period of the institution, be already tob« 
transacted upon any such pleasant and easy terms, as with 
the old established ^rm. Judge and Co., the business of 
vhich has for so many hundred years been conducted upoa 
the true principles of trade. 

Expect not therefore to find already established, by the 
aide of each delay-shop^ a verdict^skop^ at which, addressing 
himself to a clerk of the Guinea Boards with as much 
frankness as if in an Error-oiBce it were a solicitor to 
a swindler addressing himself to the clerk of the. Errors^ a 
solicitor in the smuggling line may say — The King against 
such an one — / am jor tJu defendant: secure me a verdict I 
penalty^ so much: ^per cent, upon that sum^ so much: here 
it is for you. 

m):*^o the prosperity of this branch of the trade, on& 
limit there is, which is set by the very nature of the trade. 

The regular corruptors are here the fair traders : casual. 
Such as smugglers, are but interlopers: between the fair 
trader and the interloper there exists an everlasting jea- 
lousy. This being the case, suppose this branch of trade 
arrived even at its highest possible pitch of improvement*— 
no one Guinea-man could expect to sell any more verdicts 
than one. His comrade would peach of course : he would 
of course be let drop out of the list, and there would be an 
end of him. Therefore, unless the case be such that the 

J rice offered for the verdict is more than a place at the 
Ibard is worth, the Guinea-man is no less incorruptible 
than Caesar'^ wife was chaste. 

Expect not every thing at once. Arm yourself with pa- 
tience. A few pages more, and — though you will not find 
the curtain that screens the verdict-office so completely 
drawn up^ as that which once screened the delay-offices has 
now been for these eleven years — ^yet, should your patience 
serve you till Part II. Chap, 3. a slight peep behind thi% 
curtain you shall have.

CHAP. VI. Purposes, to which Influence on Juries 

MAY BE MADE SUBSERVIENT. 

^ 1 • Blind Confidence in Judges not warrantabU. 

IF, for confining the exercise of it within the paths of 
justice, the power of the Judge stood not in need of atly 
kind of check, the destruction of the sort of check whic|i 
was designed, and is supposed to be applied to it by. thie 
functions of the jury, would not afford any just cause' of 
complaint, any demand for reformation. 

If, in the situation of Judge, a man were not liable %o 
stand exposed to the action of any sinister interest, or deli;^ 
sive passion, opposite to the interest of the public, in re- 
spect of the ends of justice^ viz. neither on kts own indiyi- 
dual account, nor on account of any other individuals or 
classes of men, whose interests or passions,* by whatsoever 
tie connected with his own, it may happen to him to 
espouse — were such the real state of things, on tliat suppo- 
sition, the exercise — the fndependent and well-considered 
exercise— of the functions of the jury would not, in the 
character of a chec(L to the power of the judge, be of any 
use ; nor therefore would any diminution of that indepen- 
dence present any just cause of complaint, any demand 
for reformation,*' 

Not that, even on this supposition, the propriety of con- 
tinuing the use of juries, whose obsequiousness were thus 
regarded as certain^ would, in this or any other part of 
the field of jury trial, be the practical inference. No: the 
practical inference ^ould be—- rthat, in this part at least, of 
that field, juries ought to be abolished. 

For sure it is, that if so cumbrous and expensive an ap* 
^endage as is the jury-box to the official bench were not usm^ 
Jul, it would be much worse than useless. To the course of 
judicature, in the character of a source of factitious com- 
plication, and thence of factitious delay, vexation, and ex- 
pence, it is, as it is, an enormous — as at test it would ^<— 
a considerable incumbrance : while to such individuals as 
are loaded with the duty of filling it without recompence, 
thp vexation is such as to constitute, as we have seen,* no

Throughout the whole field joi special jury trial, for con-

•witbm the paths of Jiistice, there exists much need of a 
check, and that an emcient one. 

For» in the situation of judge» throughout the whole of 
ikaf, field, (whatsoever is situated without that field be- 
loi^ not to the present purpose,) a man is continually 
exfiosed to the action of sini^er interest* and delusive pas- 
.sion, acting in direaions^ opposite tx>' the interest of the 
public in reject of the tnds y' justice: to sinister interest 
and passion, casually on bis own individual account, much 
more fre^ently on account of other individuals or classes 
|if men, whose interests or passions, by whatsoever tie con- 
nected with his own, it may happen to him to espouse, 

T^fo^gb^ot the whole field of special jury trial, obseq«i<* 
0U|nc3S on the pait, of juries — obsequiousness (secured^ iis 
above, by corrupt influence) is thereibre, if the above pro- 
positions be true, prejudicial, in a high degree, to the intid-

cative of the several interests by which, when acting in the 
direction of sinister interests^ the conduct of public func-

more particular degree, ll^le tp be warped. 

Partiality — piz. m favour of the interests of this or t^at 
other individual or class of men — will be apt to present it- 
self as another interesit — and certainly not an inefficient in- 
terest — distinct from the above. Such as it is, the indica- 
tion of it may however, in a certain sense, be comprized i^ 
the above list : since by th^t one word are indicated the 
leveral sorts of interests already spoken pf as comprehended 
in that list; the only difference being in the personality of 
the individual or individuals, whose intejr,est is considered as 
feeing at stake. The pecuniary or money interesit, to the 
action of which, in tne character of a sinister interest, I 
^tand exposed, may h^ve fqr its exterior cause a sum of 
money which / myself ^m in a way to gain or lose, or a 
sum of money which another person whose interests I 
espouse, may be in a way to gain or lose: and so in regard

power is concerned, those cases excepted, if any such there 
nappen to be, (for they are but of casual occurrence,) \tk 
which, the affections of the Judge taking an interest, in the 
way oi partialities^* in the event of the cause, it may hap- 

gn to his power ^ in the event of his endeavouring to af- 
rd to that partiality a gratification at the expence of jus* 
ticci to find* in the power of the jury, an opposing checK. 

Love of e^se and desire of vengeance, may therefore be set 
down as the two passions or aflfections, from the influence 
pf which, for want of such check as the power of a jury 
was intended to apply » the interests of justice are most ex- 
posed to suffer in such hands. 

Love of ease applies, and applies alike, to all sorts of 
causes: vengeance, unless by mere accident, to' but one, 
and that comparatively a narrow one, viz^ Hbel causes; but 
that, with reference to the interest of the public, so impor- 
tant a one, that all others shrink as it were to nothing in 
comparison of it. 

Not only r^oriey and power, but dignity and respect, being 
secured by office, the chief object of solicitude and pur- 
suit renjaining to the Judge, is ease. Bur, so far as jury 
trial is concerned, the ease of tire Judge is as the obseq\iiouS' 
ness of the /«ry. These polunteers, so different froi^ some 
others, bemg by the very nature of their situation, and 
withoiU need of exertion ^ny where, kept in a state of con- 
stant preparatipn apd established discipline, waiting and.

* I remember hearing partialities, and even the habit of partiality imputed by 
many to Lord Mansfield : I cannot take upon me to say with what truth. Partly 
by situation, partly by disposition, exposed to party enmity, so he accordingly 
^as to calumny. ** Lord Mansfield/' (iK|d his everlasting rival and adversary 
lord Camden once) " Lord Mansfield has $1 way of saying— It is a rule with me— 
*< an inviolable rule — never to hear a syllable said out of court about any cause 
■** that either is, or is in the smallest degree likely to come, before me." *' Now 
** I — for my part** — (observed Lord Camden) " I could Jicar ?is inauy pepple as 
•• choose jt talk to me about their causesr— it yvould pever make any the sUgktest 
•• impression upon me." .... Such was the anecdote whispered to me (Lord 
Camden himself at no great distance) by a noble friend of his, by whom I was 
bid to receive it as conclusive evidence of heroic purity. 

In the days of chivalry, when it happened to the knight and his princess to 
find then^lves tete-ci'tete upon their travels, and the place of repose, as would 
sometimes ha|)pen, oft'ered but one bed, a drawn sv^rd^ placed in a proper 
direction,, sufficed to preserve whatever was proper to be preserved. This was 
in days of yore, when pigs were swine, and so forth. In these degenerate 
days, the security afforded by a brick-wall would, in the minds of the ccn^orjr 
pus multitude, be apt to command more confidence.

for the understanding it, labour^ on the part of the Judge, 
is reduced to its mntmum^ ease raised to its maxintum. If 
circumstances be to such a degree favourable, that not so 
much as the show of explanation is found necessary, so 
inuch the better : — at the worst, all anxiety ^ and with it th6

Nor, in this way, is the reputation of the Judge worse

made continually, and in all shapes: in all shapes, and in 
particular in that of justice , the only one which belongs to 
the present purpose. Of a sacrifice of this sort, a sketch,

Thus much as to the ipterests, to the action of which, 
Vxxx the direction and character of sinister interests) the pro- 
bity of a Judge, in every age land country, is Ufibu to stand 
exposed. 

JSut-^not to speak of the footing on which the matte;: 
may stand in this or that other country— ^in England at Jeast^ 
»o far as concerns pecuniary inicrest-^he most uniforq^ly 
fictiv^ and generally irresistible of all sinister intcrestS'-Mhp 
dejgree in which the probity of a Ju4ge has ever stood, and 
still continues to stand, exposed — in mechanical language, tq 
the action of sinister interest — in chemical language, to 'the 
action of the matter of corruption — is such as cannot ai^y 
where be exceeded. 

Paid as he is paid — ^and were he even paid on any purer 
principle — trained as he has been itzini^a-^raughted frongi 
the c^r/^i from which be has been draughted — not only his 
interests; but the prejudices begotten by those interests, are 
in a state of constant, universal, and diametrical opposition 
CO his duty— to every branch of that duty — to every one, 
>yithout exception, of the ends of Justice — {Scotch Reform,^

look out for any remoter ends :— to the coilateral ends — ^avoid- 
ance of unnecessary delay t vexation ^ and expence — to the 
main ends, avoidance of denied ot justice^ and of undue de- 
cision to the prejudice of the plaintiff *s side, and avoidance 
of undue decision to the prejudice of the d^endant*s side. 
In a word, in exact proportion as by, or under, the autho- 
rity of this Dives the suitors are tormented: he himself-^- 
not only in his preceding character of Advocate had been 
used to be^ but in his present character of Judge continues 
to be — cornforted! ■ . '

and ^^£c;^f/»/ delinquent— with whom he is not linked by th6 
banas of a common interest.. Not a wrongs from which, if 
not certainly and immediately^ at any rate in respect of its 
natural and frequently efficacious tendency^ he does not de- 
rive a projit. The more wrongs^ the more causes: and the 
more causes the more Jees ! 

Not an imaginable channel (that of jponishable bribery 
alone excepted) in which, in the shape' of the matter of 
corruption, the matter of wealth does not, under the name 
of Jees, flow in daily streams into the pocket and bosom of 
the Judge. — i. Receipt of fees in virtue of his own office 
under his own name. 2. Fee-yielding office, given in ap- 
pearance to a clerk^ out of whose hands the profits of it are 
squeezed. ^. Sale of a fee-yielding office for full value. 
4. Fine OT bonus omdrxiiision. 5. Fee-yielding office given

jpiity. 7. Fee-yielding office given, or the profits of it 
maae payable, to persons standing as trustees, for a principal

to be the Judge himself. 

No other country upon earth, in which among Judges — 
(I speak always of those of the highest rank, to M'hom alone 
thp name is given, and by whom the great and happily un« 
corrupt body of those functionaries is ruled,) no other coun- 
try upon earth in which, in this highest rank, amongst these 
monopolizers of the honour so justly due to the function, 
corruption has place to an extent approaching to that to 
which it has spread in this country of pretended purity, or 
in which it is possible that any thing like equal profit should 
be made by it. In other countries, not being practicabtt

but in the shape of bribery or extortion^ practices proscribed 
hy law, and necessarily open to detection, it is but casual: 
in England, being, in. all these other forms that have been 
mentipned, either legalized^ or seated above the reach of 
punishm^t^ it is, in that highest rank, constant and untversai. 

By means of sine-cures in general, and judicial sine-cui!<ft 
ofiBces in particular, whatsoever money is levied upon the 
subject is so much extracted from him on false pretences: ' 
the tyranny of extortion f and the turpitude of szmndling^ ace 
combined in it. In the case of ^'iJ|fMi/ sine-cures, bjr the 
very men by whom these enormities are punished— -punished 
in cases in which they derive a profit from the punishment, 
and none from the practice— these same enormities are not 
only connived att hut participated in^^nd the profit pocketed. 

Falsc^hood — corrupt and wilful falsehood — mendacity, in a 
word— -the common instrument of all.cpr^^— was, in the in« 
stance of all those ju4icatories (as any map may see even in 
Blackstone) amd^g the notorious foundations or instruments 
of their power :iand, in every one of them» from the be* 
ginning o.f each cause to the end, sometimes by the lips or 
the. hand, always pnder the eyes of the Judge, matter of 
constant and universal practice. Not one of them, in \yhi^b 
it is — not merely allowed of, but encouraged ; and not only 
encouraged,, but forced, inexorably, forced. Without so 
much as an attempt at argument, in the very teeth of com- 
mon sensQi falsehood^ the irreconcileable enemy .of justice — 
falsehood^ under the name offction-^s passed off by them 
upon the deluded people — passed off as the ffue friend and * 
necessary instrument of justice! 

In such a state of things, behold two prepositions, between 
which the perplexed and deluded people are left to make 
their choice:— 1. That falsehood— ^wilful, deliberate, and ra- 
pacious falsehood — is not a vice: or 2. That it is in the 
power of ntan-^of every man who has the power of n^ 
Jfuetge^^^o wash away the filth of Yice, and transform her 
into Virtue. 

Hence, if mendacity and rapacity be vices, the very sink 
of vice is the seat of the titled lawyer, who, to his other 
titles, blushes not to add that of Custos Morum-^Guardian 
rfthepuUic morals: as if" the most noted among procuresses

but legalized, upon the reputation of the Judges, be they 
who they m^y, who act unaer it. 

In the way of sale^ or in any other way, suppose the 
Judge to derive an advantage from an office, the profits be- 
ing composed olfees^ the aggregate amount of which it de- 
pends upon himself to increase or preserve from diminu- 
tion : for example, by increasing or preserving from dimi- 
nution the number of the occasions on which they shall be 
received. If among the acts by which an advantage of this 
nature is capable of being reaped, there be any one which 
hetng prokiaited by law, and made punishable^ is, upon occa^ 
sion, actually punished^ — then it is, that in case of hi& be- 
ing known or suspected to have done any such act, his re- 
putation will be more or less alFeeted. But let that same 
act be allowed by law and legalized, his reputation remains 
untouched. 

Now there are two sorts of law, by either of which, or 
by a mixture of both, a judicial practice may be legalized: 
one is common, alias unwritten law; and this is the sort of 
law which (in so far as a rule of action which has no deter- 
minate set of words belonging to it can be said to be made) — 
has for its makers the Judges themselves; since it is by their 
own practice that it is made. The other is statute law ; and 
in the making of this, through the means of their partners 
in trade in both houses, they have at all times possessed and 
exercised a most baneful, and, if not altogether irresistible* 
scarce ever resisted influence.*

Here we see one specimen of the corruption, which now for these eleven ^rs

nued on foof, with the full knowledge and connivance, if not of all the mem- 
bers) at any rate of all the lawyer-members, of both Houses. 

The elementary data, from which the above calculation has been made> are as 
follows : — 

1. Costs of a Writ of 9BDr from Cominon Pleas to Kin^s Benchy exclusive Of 

those which take place wflre the Wiit of Error is not a sham one, i. e. when it 

is ar^ued-^which it scarce ever is— ^perhaps not once in the 15 years, 55/. Os. sd,

In some instances, by the variable nature of the expeiices, in others by th 
obscurity that overhangs such accounts of them as have transpired, errors ia 
the above figures cannot but have here and there been produceil. But the ut- 
most possible amount of them is hot considerable enough to warrant the expen- 
ditureof the quantity of letterpress that wouM be necessary for the indication of 
these dark spots. For the same reason the indication of a large mass of articles 
by which the totals of profit are increased, vix. as well of profit to the use of the 
Jirm of Judge and Co. at large as of Do. to the use of the managing partners in 
particular, is omitted. (Of thfs branch of the trade of Judge and Co. a particu- 
lar account, extracted from the finance Report above-mentioned, together with 
other dqpuraents furnished by the House of Lords, and illustrated by elucida- 
tions, has been digested into the form of SL.Tahie, which, under the name of 
Enoush and Scotch Appeal Tasls for 1795, 17 90, and 1797, may be had of the 
publi^ars of this work.) 

IL fm an example of corruption legalized under the influence of lawyers by 
Stalttte law, take tbe case of the statute 5 and 6 Edw. 0. c. 16, " against buying

" office. . . . which shall in any wise. . • . concern the administration or ezccutio»

Lastly comes a section which the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Com* 
mon Pleas (not to speak of the then ** Justices of Assize") had the effrontery 
ind good fortune to get inserted, exempting them, (with their successors] and 
Aam alone, from the ojieration of the statute. 

VTot that, had it even been purged of this exemption, it was in the nature of 
this statute, to have contributed any thing to the object thus professed by it : half 
a dozen different channels have abov^ been indicated, through any one of which, 
adva7itage may be extracted by a Judge from the increase, disadvantage sus- 
tained by him from the decrease, of the mass of emolument attached to an of^ 
fice, which he has at his disposal. 

Shut up any one or more, leaving any one or more open, what is the conse- 
quence ? Whatever parcel of the matter of corruijribii would have flowed into 
his pocket and his bosom, through the channels tUKshut i^, flows in through 
those that remain open : aggregate mass of corruption just the same ajier the 
law as before, 

But besides being useless, the effect it would have had, had it had any, would 
have been worse than none. Affording the appearance of security, it would 
have increased confidence, diminished suspicion and vjgilance : but, the secu- 
rity being false, and the confidence ill-grounded, increased security to corrup-.;^' 
tion would have been the effect of the diminished vigilance. 

The ark\y means, but that a most efiectual one, by which the matter of cor- 
ruption, in the shape of pecuniary profit, can from the source here in question, 
be prevented from flowing into the pocket and bosom of the Judge, has been al- 
ready indicated, {Scotch Reform, L5,t.i.p. 8.) viz. conversion of the variable 
mass of emolument into a fxt one : i. e. of income composed of fees, into in- 
come in the shape of salary. Connivance at non-feasance or misfeasance— ^t 
neglect or mal-practice, whetheJ the result of improbity or incapacity, is the', 
only mode in which, in that case, it could be either in the inclination, or in the 
power, of the Judge to participate by connivance in the misconduct of an unfit 
subordinate. 

Not that, by any such purely prospective change, the existing depratity of the 
system would be washed away, or so much as reduced :— it would only be pre- 
vented from receiving increase. 

• III. For an example of corruption Ici^alized by a conjunct operation, viz. partly 
by law of the Judges own making, partly by statute law, made under their in- 
fluence, as above, a case already brought to view may serve.

1. To a non-lawyer, though a man of opulence, distrnguished by the title of 
esquire, and, according to the assumed principle, extra paid, in consideration 
of his extra oputence-— to every such non-lawyer, for ser\'ing in the character of. 
special juryman, in a state of confinement for an indefinite lengtlat^ timtf, 
amounting to any number of hours, 5, icr, 15^, or 20, as it might BQ^pen, a 
sum which, after having under their management been subjected to such a de- 
gree of irregular excess as bad become scandalous, was at length by the legisla- 
ture limited tot/. J. v.

uncontrouled fixatiotr, for doing nothing, 5/. a*.

sides a multitude in which it is. 

But this system of geiferal proscription, this system of 
general outlawry, being the worA of law^ is according to 
law: the creators and preservers of it, being all men of

Islackstone, •* every thing is as it should be.'* 

2. Impurity, covered over by perpetually renewed coat- 
ings of praise. 

Partly by the imbecility, partly by the interested artifice 
of the makers, the rule of action, unwritten and written law 
together, having been worked up into a chaos, of which it 
is impossible for the people to form to themselves any tolera- 
ble conception: hence such conception as they have of it,, 
is grounded, exclusively, upon the reports made of it by the

It, the greater their apprehension, lest its depravity should 
be discovered. The less deserving it is of praise, the greater 
the need it has of praise i the more flagrant its defects, the 
greater the demand for the only sort of covering of which 
they are susceptible. Scotch Reform, Let. 4, p. 78. 

1. In regard to the system, the more afflictive it is to the 
people in the character of suitors, the more profitable it 



IS to the man of law : and the greater the profit he derives 
from it, the greater the quantity of praise which i| is his in- 
terest to bestow upon it, and which accordingly he ever has 
bestowed, and ever will bestow, upon it. 

2. So in regard to the persons, by whom for the time 
being it is administered : the persons themselves being 
linked together by the tie of one common interest, and all 
who either dare to publish ajiy account of th^r proceedings^ 
ov diVt qualified to publish any tolerably f^rr^^/ one, being 
candidates tor their favour, the consequence is— that, with 
the rare and casual exceptions produced by party jealou- 
sies, the same picture of scarcely diversified excellence has 
served for all of them at all times. The portrait is thlAt 
same : and all that remains for this and that new limner 
is to write under it this and that new namem 

In this happy state of things, the system, .and (hose by 
whom it is administered, afford reciprocal demonstrations of 
each others* excellence: the excellence of the system is' 
proved by the excellence of those by whom it is adminis- , 
tered : and the excellence of those by whom the system is 
administered is proved by the excellence of the system by 
which they were Jormed and under which they act. 

Up to the instant which sees him mounted on the pinna^ 
cle of the bench, the man of law is recognized by every - 
body, as being of the number of those to whom right and 
wrong, truth dinA falsehood, would be matter of complete 
indifference, were it not for the predilection naturally en- 
tertained for the best customer : and in whom the minister^ 
of the day, through whose hands in his way to that pin- 
nacle he. must first have passed, has found an instrument 
no less ready, for the wages of corruption, to do the work 
of corruption upon the largest scale, than the individual 
wrong-doer has found him to do the work of iniquity upon 
any smaller scale. Yes, and although his interest remains 
at le^st as opposite as ever to the interests of the commumty^ 
in respect to the ends of justice, no sooner have the forn* 
a.'id substance of bis robes undergone the customary tran^'

universally understood to havie undergone the correspon-

the zvill^ the training of which towards the paths of in- 
iquity, had till then been so generally recognized, is no\^ 
secured against all danger of taking a wrong clirection^ being 
itself become the standard of rectitude. 

3, By intimidation^ the impurity protected against disclo- 
sure. 

While, under the spur of every excitement which avarice 
or ambition can apply — (every thing that is said of the law 
and its administrators, being a sort of prize-essay on their 
perfections)— while, by the force of this stimulus, whatsQf 
ever features of excellence it posseses are raked together, 
and held up to view, decorated with every embellishment 
^hat interested eloquence can bestow — its defects, were they 
etill more flagrant than they are, would be* as they ever 
have been, kept covered up and protected against disclosure* 
by every force that either authority or power — influence of 
^^understanding over understanding, or influence of will over 
will — can bring to bear upon the subject. 

Point out a defect in the system, all ears are stopped against 
every thing you can say, all eyes shut against every thing 
you can write: or if haply indignation breaks the bridle 
«et upon the tongue and the pen by prudence, hatred and 
contempt in all their forms — sincere hatred, accompanied 
with simulated contenipt — are poured upon your head. Ja* 
cohn, leveller, enemy of social order—theorist, speculatist, 
visionary — compose the arguments you have to encounter — t 
together with whatsoever other appropriate epithets and 
phrases, substitutes to truth and reason, are furnished by 
the Courtier's and Lawyer's Gradus. 

Touch upon those who act under the system — under it — or, 
if so it please them, over it — point out any defect in their 
conduct in respect of it, millstones atill better adapted to 
the purpose of crushing, than either hatred or contempt- 
ruin in the shape ol prosecution — and, if that be not enough, 
in the shape of imprisonment-r^voWhiowcs ready to be let fall 
every moment, at the nod of caprice or vengeance — hang 
aloft oVer your head. 

Victims of the system, or sympathizing with thofe that 
are, whatsoever complai^nis men have ventured to give vent 
to on this ground, terror and prejudice have combined to 
point to the wrong mark. The s^ystem is faultless; the 



, ^/ 



7© Chap. VI. Purposes, Influence on Juries is apfdicabU to. 

creators and upholders of it are faultless : but, in the shape 
of wicked attornies^ evil spirits creep in now and then, 
and convert into poison the salutary remedies it affords. 

No representation was ever more opposite to th& truth. 
The quantity of mischief produced by any thing which, 
under the name of irregular practice, is either punishable 
or censurable, is as nothing in comparison of that which is 

I produced by regular practice — by that which has been Icga- 
ized and organized for the purpose : and even the loop, 
holes, at which the irregularities have crept in, are amongst 
the works which the regularity of regular practice has had 
for its objects and its. uses. If judgments are snapt, it is be- 
cause, by the pre-established mechanism, {Scotch Reform^ 
Let. t. Devices 5 and 8) they w^re framed as they are, to fit 
them for being snapt. Now and then, in great ceremony, in 
the character of scape-goat, or, to speak in modern language, 
in the character of tinman, in expiation oi the sins of the 
whole tribe, a miserable attorney, the child of the system, is 
sacrificed on the altar of offended justice : but the chief pro- 
filer by all those sinis, is the Chi^ Priest, who with indignatioo^^^ 
on his brow, and laughter in his heart, offers up the sacrifice. * 

By the inferior branch of the profession— by tlie attorney 
branch — the system has all along been taken such as it has 
been found,: it is by the two superior branches— composed 
of Judges and Advocates — Advocates in the senate. Judges 
occasionally in the senate, constantly on the bench — that it 
has been made such as we see, or rather as we Jeel it. 

Of the three branches the inferior, as it is the most popu- 
lous, so is it in its nature the least impure. To an attor- 
ney — those operations and instruments excepted, in which 
the part he takes is compulsory and unavoidable, having 
been imposed upon him by Judges — to an attorney, as such, 
the language of insincerity is never necessary. On the part 
of the Advocate, the necessitv and consequently the prac 
tice, is constant: the only choice there is for him is be- 
tween the more and the less. 

Such is the mind of the Advocate: and the mind of the 
Advocate is the stuff of which the mind of iht Judge is niiade. 

Filling the bench from no other fund than the bar, is it 
not exactly such a mode as if boarding-school-mistresses and 
governesses, were never to be chosen but from brothels ? — 

Yet by giving to the. matter and language of the law, 
a texture nauseous to every liberal mind, and impenetrable 
to every mi|id not sharpened by hunger, an exctu^iye ad- 



§ « . Interests^ to the Action oj which Judges are exposed. 7 1 

mission to the bench has been secured, in favour of a pror 
fession which, if either love of justice or of truth had been 
considered as necessary qualifications, would for ever have 
stood excluded. 

Obvious as they are, against all these considerations the 
non lawyer has learnt to shut his eyes. At an early age, the 
picture of the law drawn by Blackstone had been put into 
his hands : a picture in which all deformities and turpitudes 
are plaistered OMer with the most brilliant colours. To pry. 
into the original would require hard labour : to glance over 
the picture requires but a glance. Set before him the ori- 
ginal, he turns aside from it : to an insight into the original, 
he prefers a dream over the picture. 

Thus it is, that when rightly considered, the popularity 
of the system — paradoxical as at first sight the proposition 
cannot but appear — iht popularity ot the system, so far from 
being a conclusive proof of its excellence, affords a proofs 
inasmuch as it is among the results^ of its depravity ; the 
depravity being the cause, of which, through the interven- 
tion ot the intermediate causes that have been brouglit to 
view, the popularity has been the effect: 

1. Depravity, viz. in respect o\ factitious delay, vexation, 
and expence. 2. Profitableness to lawyers, in respect to their 
profit upon the expe^nce. 3. Popularity among lalifyers* 
4. Praises by lawyers • 5. Popularity among the people at 
large, but more particularly among the ruling classes, con- 
nected in so many points of sinister interest with the 
lawyers — in three out of the zhovet Jive we see the interine^ 
diate links, by which a cause and Effect, to a first view so 
wide of each other, have been brought into connection. 

Important as these topics are — viz. the goodness of the 
system, and the virtue of those who act under or by virtue 
of it, to the present purpose they belong in no other point 
erf view than this :— of the packing system — being a system 
which, it has already " been seen, is established^ and, as it 
will soon be seen, has been avowed, the effect — (quoth the 
argument against it — say in lawyer's jargon the declara^ 
tion) — is to destroy this part of the constitution, by de- 
stroying the check which the power of the jury was in- 
tended to keep applied to the power of the judge; — nay; 
but so transcendently pure, (quoth the argument in favour 
of the package — say the plea) so transcendently pure, under 
and by virtue of the system is the virtue of the judge, 
that no such check is or «ver can be necessary. Such be-

ing the plea, it became necessary to traverse \i : and if the 
plea itself be no departure, so neither is the traverse.

§1. liberty of the Press — has it any and what existence? 

. W^E come now to the grand and paramount use of the 
packing jyj/(f ;;/■*— the crushing the liberty of the press-destroy^ 
ing whatever remains of it undestroyed. 

To prevent indistinct or erroneous conception, a few 
words of explanation may here, once for all, be of use. 

King de jure and King de Jacto^ is a distinction familiar 
to every eyo, that has ever glanced over English history. 
The same distinction must be applied to the liberty of the 
press, by whosoever would be saved from falling into error 
and heterodoxy on this scabrous ground: Liberty q/ thepfess 
by law? No. That sort of liberty excepted which consists 
in the non-existence of a safety-shop, in the shape of a 
Licencer's office, no such thing either has or^vcr has had any 
existence. So, embodied in the person of Lord Mansfield, 
the soul of the custos morum certified to some of us in 
1770.* So, embodied in the person of Lord Ellenborougb, 
the same guardian spirit of good ord^r confirmed to us in 
,1804.+ 

Liberty of the press de facto? — Yes: t;iz. that which*, 
being contrary to lauo, proscribed by law, has all along 
maintained a sort ot rickety, and stiU maintains a momen- 
tary half-existence, in the teeth of consistency as well at 
law, by means of breach of the law in low situations, and 
non-execution of the law in high ones. 






♦ The liberty of the press consists in no more than this-'^-n liberty to print 
now without a liconcc, what formerly could be printed only xuith one.** Per

§ !• Liberty of the Press — in what it exists. 73 

Hence it was, that in the place of any such words as 
destruction or destroying — which otherwise would have been 
60 much more obvious — it was necessary to look out for 
some other of a less determinate import, such as crushing,, 
as above. For of any such word ^ destroying the effect 
would have been to bring in with it, and keep attached to 
it, the idea or^ existence : than Vi^hich, as above, a more 
dangerous. heresy could not by any Englishman, Protestant 
or Catholic, be entertained. 

But, forasmuch as, in neglected bodies, vermin of all 
sorts will be apt to crawl into existence, hence comes the 
necessuy which persons in '* high situations'* are under, of . 
keepmg in their hands the means of crushing — as often as 
in ^ny such shape and stature as to render itself trouble- 
some, it happens to it to shew itself — the liberty — but, for^ 
get not for a moment, the de facto liberty — of the press. 

In the first place, while pen and ink remain still at com* 
mand, I shall endeavour to bring to view a sketch— ».m 
extremely slight and temporary one — (for that is all that 
can here be given) — a sketch, or rather as before a sample — . 
of the interest which not only Judge and Co: as above, but 
morrow Qv iht high connections oi i\\Q firm y have, in keeping 
the liberty of the press in the sort of abortive embryo state, 
in which it has so effectually been preserved ; mz* by the 
hands by which, had convenience prescribed, and possibi- 
lity permitted, it would have long ago been no less effec- 
tually destroyed. I shall then, but rather in the way of re^ 
capitulation and reference^ than in any other, add the little 
that can be necessary to shew the assistance that may al« 
ways be depended upon from the zeal of the Master Packer* s 
office^ and the discipline of the Guinea Corps on the occa* 
sion of so necessary a service. 

In the catalogue of abuses. Judges have their peculiar aw 
tides, other high seated persons have theirs. But, tower* 
ing above all the rest, one abuse there is, in the profit of 
which Judge and Co. find theiV partners, in the very highest 
and most impregnable situations : in the one House, in thq 
other House, in the Cabinet, in the Closet: yea, even 
among those whom " the King deli^hteth most to honour ** 
I speak of that congeries of abuses, the component elements 
of which are Law -sine-cures* 

So far as Judges alone are concerned, it has been slightly 
touched upon already: but in consideration of the prodigi* 
ous increase of strength, given to the alliance bipartitf

httM^ttn judges and wrdngdoers^ by the accession oi Court* 
favourites^ and the triple alliance thus formed for carrying 
on with irresistible force the predatory war against the 
common enemies, viz. Liberty and Justice^ a few ulterior 
elucidations, respecting the nature and cementing principle 
of the alliance may h^Tte their use. 



^ a. Improbity in Judges^ and their high Allies — its hostility 

to the Press. 

Some years ago,* on the examination of a question of 
finance, I found occasion to inquire in what way, by the 
taking out of the pockets of the people a giyen sum of 
money, the greatest possible quantity of mischief was pro- 
duced. The result was— ^-by assessing it, in the foi-m of a 
lax, on the several operations and instruTnents ^ the perform- 
ance and exhibition of which were rendered necessary to a 
man to enable him, whether in the shape of plaintiff or in 
that of defendant, to take his chance for justice. 

Affliction heaped upon affliction^ in the case of him who 
)Las wherewithal to comply with the exaction — denial of all 
reliefs exposure or rather subjection to all imaginable wrongs^ 
in the case of him who has not wherewithal to satisfy the ex- 
action — such are the shapes, in one or other of which, or 
both, the mischief manifests itself ; and in the latter case, 
being the case of virtual outlawry, a vast majority of the 
subjects of the British empire, say nine-tenths^ say, more 
likely, nineteen-twentieths, subject to limitations and excep- 
tions top particular, and upon the whole of too little ex- 
tent, to admit of notice in this place, would be found. See 
Scotch Reform, Let. i . p. 9, and elsewhere. 

The quantity of money, taken from a man on this account, 
being, in the mathematical sense, given, i. e. determined — 
what the appellation employed on that occasion may happen 
to be — for example, a^zjc or a^f— as well as what the pocket 
may happen to be, in which it finds its resting place after it 
has gone out of his own — whether that of the public, for 
example, or that of ^ judge ^ or other man of law — is to him, 
and in respect of the quantity of suffering of which in his 
instance the defalcation is productive, a matter of indiffe- 
rence. Yet so it happens, that though the quantity of money 

• 

• Anno 179«, in the jwmphlct entitled, Vroitsi against Law Taxes. 



§ t. ImproKiy in Judges^ &c. — iis kosiiliiy id ihe Press, ^ 

so raised being given, a tax on law proceedings is by far the 
worst of all possible taxes, yd, by the money raised on lavf 
proceedings under the name oijees, mischief, to an incomer, 
parabiy greater amount, has been produced; than by moneys 
raised on the same occasion under the name of taxes^ 

The reason is altogether simple. By the man of finance^ 
at whose instance the money is exacted in the name of a tax^ 
the occasions on which it is exacted are not created, but 
taken as they are found. But of the man of law, especially 
in the station oi judge, by v/hose power ^ and, in some shape 
or other, for whose benefit, the money is exacted in the name, 
of Si fee, it has been in the power to create the occasions on 
which it is exacted, which accordingly he has done. And in, 
this difference, the immense load of misery, so regularly 
manufactured by judges, their connections and dependents, 
has found its cause. The amount of this mischief has in 
some sort found its expression, in the diiFerence between 
the amount oi factitious delay, vexation, and expence, habi* 
tually created in the technical mode of procedure, stiled on 
this- account i\\Q fee -gathering, as contradistinguished from 
that natural moit, which, without a total dissolution of the 
bonds of society, could not have been by its overbearing 
antagonist utterly expelled. See Scotch Reform, Let. i. 
p. q, and throughout. 

Of these fees^ by the concourse, as usual, of sinister de- 
sign and accident, masses of emolument of different bulks, 
from that of a bare subsistence to ieti^ twenty, or even 
thirty thousand pounds a year and upwards, exacted by so 
many different persons, have been composed; and^tiere 
comes the community of sinister interest, by which the 
Judges of all the high judicatories without exception — and 
in panicular the Chief Justice of the King's Bench — the. 
master manufacturer of liSel law — and in effect the absolute 
master of the press — havie been linked together: linked with 
each other, and with some of the most influential membersi« 
of those supreme assemblies, from which* alone; remedy to 
abuse, in this or any other shape, can come. 

Where, of the masses of emolument thus formed, the 
bulk has been to a certain degree moderate, (being received 
in all cases in the name of reward for service) the reward 
has been suffered to remain in the pocket of him by whom 
the service has been performed. 
.Where it has happened to the mass to swell to such a 



T^r Chtp. VII. Chief Purpose^ crushing the Press, 

bulk as to attract the notice of irresistible rapacity in a. 
higher sphere, it has been fastened upon as a prey: and, a 
comparatively small pittance, though by the experiment proved 
to constitute an adequate compensation for the burthen of 
the ser^ce, being left to the low-seated individual by 
vrhom the service was performed, the remainder has been 
seized by the high-seated personage, by whom in that shape 
no service whatever has been rendered, even in pretence ; 
and to whom, in many instances, it has never h^tnneces^ 
sary, that he should have rendered to the public any the 
smallest service whatsoever, in that or any other shape. 

Of these enormous masses of misery-making emolument, 
out-stripping by far in magnitude, if not in mischievous- 
ncss, whatever has been produced by the judicial system of 
any other the, most outrageously mis-governed country, 
some have been seized by Judges, and above all by the 
Chief Justice of the Ming's Bench — others having been left 
in the hands of the Crown, have fallen a prey to the vul- 
tures that rt)ver about a Court. And here we see a natural 
bond of the closest union between Court and Bench. 

At present (it may be said) — whatsoever may have been 
the case formerly — at present no such sinister interest is 
created by any of these masses of emolument. For, at pre- 
sent — the maxim having been established, that no mass of 
emolument in possession, and obtained without breach of 
law, shall be taken from any man without an equivalent — 
no iftan has any interest in the retention of them^^neitlier a 
Judge tior any one else. < 

To this observation the col6ur of reason is not wanting, 
but the substance is. Allowances which, under the spur of 
reform, have thus been given by the legislature under the 
name of equivalents^ have scarce ever been complete. 

Of the masses of emolument in question, viz. those at** 
tached to sine-cure or over-paid judicial offices, it is the na« 
^ure to go on increasing, as population and wealth increase, 
from year to year : and this, evxn in the way of natural in- 
crease, and setting aside yfhaisotvev factitious increase may 
be contrived to be given to them by the combined ingenuity 
of the jpartnership. But by any allowances that should be 
given in lieu of them, under the name of equivalents, ho 
such increase would be experienced: they would he fxed 
sums in the nature of pensions. 

Of those eVer increasing masses of emolumentf not only 



4 S5. Improkiiy in jfudges^ 0c, — lis hostility to the Press, ff 

the possessors^ but the expectants^ know of course much 
hetter than to submit to any commtdation^ so long as, by any 
B3eans not punishable, it appears possible to avoid it. 

Pillaging the future as well as the present, the Gavistons 
and Spensers of successive ages — nor let the present be for- 
gotten — contrived to obtain in expectancy those masses of 
ilUcollected and ill-bestowed wealth, life after life. Passion 
and policy have here acted in alliance. Passion seized on 
the booty : policy rendered it the more secure* The more 
enormous the prey, the greater and more burthensome would 
be the compensation necessary to be given for it under th^^ 
name of an equivalent. So long as the burthen falls on mea 
whose afflictions are productive of no disturbance to the 
ease of the man of finance, it tells for nothing. [See Protest 
against Law Taxes, Ji So long as the burthen continues tQ 
be imposed by a tax which, though beyond comparison 
more mischievous than any other, was not of his iroposi'* 
tion, the man of finance bad no personal concern in the 
matter, and how enormous soever may be the ma^s of misery 
produced, it formed no object of his care. But to pro^* 
vide the compensation, if that came to be provided, was 
so much hard kbour to him: while of those he has to deal 
with and to cajole, the great crowd is composed of such as 
care not what mischief is produced by a tax, or any thing 
else they are used to, but cry out of course against every 
thing ot that sort, as of any other sort, when it is new. 

The la\y moreover is a sort of Mack lottery ^ a lottery of all 
prizes indeed without blanks, but the prizes so many negative 
quantities ; instead of so much j^r^^, so much loss : and the 
same confidence in fortune which secures to a man's imagi- 
natipn the acquisition of prizes in the state lottery so called, 
secures to it the avoidance oi them in the lottery of the law. 

And thus it is that by every continuance given to thia 
species of depredation a fresh obstacle to the abolition of ijt 
is' opposed. 

You call this economy? Do you? Know tken^ that^. by this 
economy of yours ^ the mass of public burthen, so far from be-* 
ing diminished^ will be increased: — cries the iron-hearted so- 
phist, in whose balance the heaviest load of misery in which 
he and his confederates expect not to bear a sliare, weighs 
but as a feather* 

Turn now to the Despot of the press, and consider what 
in this state of things the/ plan of polidy is which in his situa- 
tipfi a man may be expected to pursue. His first object 



fi Chap. VII. Chief Purpose^ crushing the Press. 

would of course be the affording the most effectual protec* 
tion to abuse in those instances in which the benefit of it it 
in the whole, or in part, reaped by himself and his own 
immediate connections. 

But to protect that same abuse with its benefit against 
Kmtatio0i and even reduction, under the name of compen* 
sation, tn\fr\\i require support and alliance elsewhere. To 
protect with effect the abuses the benefit of which a^ccrued 
Immediately to himself, it would therefore be necessary for 
Jiim to extend his protection without distinction to all esta- 
blished abuses, from which any oijier man so situated as to 
be capable of giving him the needful support, derived or 
could conceive himself to derive in any shape a benefit: 
in a word, to act in the character of protector-general of all 
established abuses. 

The liberty of the press being their common and irrecon- 
cileable enemy, the liberty of the press became the neces- 
sary object of -their common and interminable war: exist- 
ing, it was to be destroyed : not existing, it was, so long as 
possible, to be prevented from coming into existence. 

And here we see* the Knigkl*s service looked to at the 
hands of the Guinea corps and its Squires. 

Of the energy and effect, with which this conspiracy 
among governors against good government has been carried 
en, divers exemplifications will present themselves as we 
advance.

§ 3. Incapacity in Judges, and their high Allies — its hostility 

to the Press. 

By this co-partnership in the profits of mis-rule, the 
bond of union, formed as above, between Judges and the 
other leading members of government, is a constant one. 
But besides this, there is another which, how frequently 
soever exempli§ed, may, in comparison of the former, be 
termed an occasional one: I speak x>f that, in v/hich incapa^ 
city — congenial and mutually sympathizing incapacity — is 
the cementing principle. 

Suppose a Judge — no matter in what part^^lar respect. — 
incapable of discharging the duties of his office : discharg- 
ing them ill; or — what constitutes the most palpable of all 
exemplifications of incapacity — not at all. If on the part 
of the suitors to whom such his incapacity has been a 
fparce of injury — or, on the part of other persons, prompt- 



f 3» Incapacity in Judges^ (3c. — its hostility to the Press* 79 

cd by sympathy for their sufferings, or by tlie pure love of 
justice^ facts indicative of this incapacity, or complaints 
grounded on those facts, were made public, the consequence 
might be — an obligation on his part to withdraw from the 
situation^ his continuance in which had rendered him an ih« 
strument of such extensive injury. * 

To any such unfit Judge, a free press would naturally be 
an object no les^ odious and formidable than a prison to an 
ordinary delinquent, whose situation had not elevated him 
above the reach of justice.* ^ 

But by the same cause, incapacity^ by which a free press 
18 thus rendered an object of hatred and terror to a hinc« 



t 



f One shape/ and perhaps the only shape, in which, in the station of Jud^e, 
the existence of incapacity can be seen standing out of the reach of doabt is tn- 
decision. For, if haJbirual, it may in this shape stand expressed, and demonstrated 
in Jigitres, Thus, suppose, in a given single-seated situatioi!, three Judges oc- 
cupying that situation successively for the same length of time. The first leaves 
no arrear: the second leaves an arrear: the third clears off the arrear that h 
been left by the second, and himself leaves none. Suppose n«w, ou the part 
the second, the degree of indecision such, that the number of litigated cases de- 
cided upon by him was not a tetUh, not an eighth, not a sixth, or suppose it were 
as much as a fourth, or even as a third, of the number dispatched by his prede- 
cessor in the same length of time. In such a case, riot only must the unfitness 
ot such a Judge for the situation be clear to every body else to whom these pro- 
pocitions are known, but it is impossible that it should be matter of doubt to the 
incapable Judge himself. But the Judge being thus necessarily and fully con- 
scious of his incapacity to discharge the duties of the office, the result in point 
of mitchievousness and wrongful profit is — besides the infinite and inapprettable 
mass of misery produced on the part of suitors — peculatim to the amount of the 
undue profit extracted from the office, the duties of which were thus left un- 
performed. 

Incapacity in a shape thus palpable, swollen to a pitch which, on the part of 
him who reads of it, puts belief to the stretch, is among the endemial diseases 
of the present time, and pot ^he least bitter of the bitter fruits of libel law. Net 
long ago^pe case of this sort came out incidentally in the House of Commons r 
(See th^ff^es Newspaper, 4th July, 1807, CobhetCs Parliamentary Delales, 
FoL IX. pi. 731.) and in the profound indifference with which the facts were' 
^eard, though exhibited in numbers (to avoid ambiguity, let us say in ,figvTes) 
tnay be seen an argument, a stronger than which can hardly be looked for, 
by those to whom a recurrence to first principles in the constimtion of that 
assembly is regarded as a necessary measure. One instance happened thus to 
transpire in print, from the only p^ace, from which it is possible for grievances 
of that sort So to transpire : every wheie else libcl.law keeps them from the press 
with the degree of certainty, for the securing of which libel law with its terrors 
was and is intended. But it would be informing him of the existence of the 
iun at noon-day, were it to be said to a man of business in the profession, that 
the one here alluded to is not the only instance in which, but for the interested 
comiivance which seals up lips within doors, and the terror which chains down 
all pens without doors, incapacity not less palpable would long ago have beca 
brought ro public Usht at least, if not to jusliie, ^

lionary seated in the situation of Jv»dge, it would of course 
be rendered an object of the like emotions to a functionary 
in any other situation : to a functionary, to whose apprehen* 
sion any the least danger were to present itself of his see* 
ioff such his deficiency exposed to view. 

Men who, to all practical purposes, are seated above ihe 
law, (and the existence of an indefinite multitude of men 
ielf-seated in the situatiop, is a fact unhappily but too incon- 
testable) men so circumstanced as they — have nothing to fear 
from any other quarter — so, as far as they have any thing at 
all to fear from any quarter— have every thing to fear from 
the liberty of the press. 

Accordingly where, on an occasion already spoken of, 
tha recent grand attack was made upon that branch of 
English liberties,, and for the more effectual accomplishment 
of those purposes (if of any purposes at all) the modern case 
de famosis libellis was displayed to view — and the fundamen* 
tal principles of libel law developed, and adapted to existing 
arcumslances^ among the propositions laid down upon 
that occasion was— *that in speaking [viz. in print) of any 
man *^ placed in a high situation^'' to say any thing ** mean-* 
•• ing to infer that'' he ** is ill-placed'* in (such) *' his high 
situation*' is •* a libel:" and this, even although his unfitness 
for that high situation be of no worse sort, than that which 
is not incompatible with his being *• ft for the ordinary 
walks of If e."'' 

If there be any way in which it is possible for the hand 
of power to afford protection and encourageriient to mis-rule — ^ 
to mis-rule in all its branches — it is surely this: viz. the 
threatening with the vengeance of the law all such as shall — 
do any thing towards holding it up to public viewj and to- 
wards this end, whether any thing, which it is possible to 
do by the exercise of judicial power, has been leftAidone,

ICEEPING the liberty of the press, as it were, iri a state' 
of constant annihilation^ (if the expression may be allowed) 
being thus, among persons *Mn high situation," in these' 
days of unexampled purity, iMt commori object — the one, 
and dl^host the only on6, in th6 attachment to which the 
iigreement is among them constant and almost univers^l-^ 
come we now to the convenience afforded by the chief jury- 
packing office for so necessary ah operation. 

By the chief jury-packing office 1 mean, on this octa- . 
sion, that one of the seven* which has for its Master Packet 
the Deputy . Remembrancer of the Exchequer. To this 
distinction the title ot that office is rendered incontestable 
by two considerations: — i. th^ permanence, and thence thie 
operations of which it is the result, are, in the instance of 
that office, avowed by the judge, and defended by hiin Up'oH 
principle, 2. The number of juries thus nominated in tb^t 
office is equal to little less than that of all the juries nomi- 
nated in like manner in all the other offices put together. 

* I embrace this o^pjtvomty of correcting si mid^stateixiem, the dtase of 
which lies, in some measure, in my present inabiHty to supervise the press: a 
mis-statement, which though, with reference to the argument, altog^^h^ td 
immaterial one, might perplex the reader by the inconsistenqr it presents, il 
hot set right. 

. When, in p. 37> (widi allusion to i^e sort of business done by Taleyrand 
under Napoleon) I designated these Master Packtrs by the appellation of Grtnd 
Electors, and with the number six before them, it was in porsaancc of a fah6 
recollection, which, at that time, represented die number of ^rothoaotitries as 
no more than two. 

In the note in p. 32, beginning Courts, three: after *' King's Bendi and Ek-

The proposition to be proved is— that though the Exche- 
quer — the judicatory to which this office belongs, is not it- 
self the judicatory in which the operation of crushing the 
liberty of the press is carried on, yet, for the purpose of that 
operation, the system of package, and the collection of per- 
manent special jurymen which compose the produce of that 
system, are no less effectually, sufficient, than if the scene 
of the chief part of the jury-packing business were an of- 
fice immediately under the judicatory in which the business 
of. crushing the liberty of the press is carried on. 

On this head little remains but to recapitulate. Here 
may be seen the grand House of Call for Guinea-men: here 
^the Receiving 'house in which the recruits are enlisted: here 
the Parade on which they 2Lre drilled: here the grdnid Muster- 
roll — the select and secret qualified list — on which they arc 
entered: here the Register -office, in which their *' connec- 
** tions,'* &c, and thence their qualifications, are registered, 
and accordingly enquired after by all lips to which the in- 
formation can be of use. 

But why (it may still be said) lay so much emphasis on 
the Exchequer? If the Exchequer has its two Master 
Packers, has not the King's Bench as many? 

Yes: but in the Exchequer, the permanence, which but 
for actuaf packing could not have place, is, as hath just 
been mentioned, irrevocably confessed^ or rather professed: 
in the King's Bench no such avowal can be produced. It 
is in the Exchequer alone that the main body of this corps 
being in constant service, it is there and there alone that, 
with certainty, and without effort, the trust- worthiness — 
the degree of discipline — of each member is known to the 
whole staff".* , , 

To this office therefore it is that in case of need, (when a 
libeller, for example, is to be punished for calling a man, in 
*' high situation," by his father's title, or for questioning his 
fitness for his office) a solicitor to the Crown would send his 
order— saying, pick me out a good dozen for King's Bench 
service. 

Oh — but all this — so far, at least, as concerns King's Bench^ 
and libel law — is but mere surmise; the work of audacious 
imagination. In the Exchequer, be it as you say : but in the 

« Special Jury causes, in a year, in the Exchequer, ^4 : In the King's Bench, 
crown side, but u. Phillips, p. 159.

Kxng*s Bench no' such packing can be proved; no such piir- 
posed selection ever yet took plact. There, at least, all is sim- 
plicity : there, all is purity. 

Thus far ray objector. But, could even any such n^g'^i- 
tive be demonstrated, slill the reilsons for the pulling down 
of all juryrpacking offices — for the complete abolition of 
the Guinea-trade — for the disbanding of this standing army — 
this noble army, not of martyrs but of martyrizers — would 
not lose any thing of their force. Down to this day no- 
thing of the . kind has been done. Be it so : but why ? 
Becaue.down to this day nothing of the kind has been ne- 
cessary./ 'Come to-morrow, and the necessity may come 
along with it:. and so sure as the necessity of the practice 
comes, so sure the practices comes along with it. 
. Convenience — slight convenfience — has long since sufficed 
to establish the practice in one judicatory, the Exchequer: 
and the united forces of self-preservation and xjengeance, will 
they not, in case of need, suffice to establish the same prac- 
tice in the King's Bench ? 

In the King's Bench, as well as in the Exchequer, the of- 
ficer, whose practice is thus open to suspicion, actually 
exists: by him the selection is actually made — made in every 
individual instance : by him, whether he will or no, a cer- 
tain quantity of information, relative to the characters and 
dispositions of the individuals, out of whom he has to choose, 
is possessed. Thus much is matter of notoriety: and the 
only proposition, liable to be mafde a question of, is — whe- 
ther, in the view of gaining additional information, it be 
likely that, in case of need, he or those whose interest in 
the business is more immediate — for example, in a state libel 
case — the solicitor of the crown — will seek for il at the hands 
of the correspondent officer of that other court, in which 
the opportunities of obtaining that sort of information are 
more abundant. 

To such a question, can there be any other answer than 
this? — If, of the sort of information in question, there be, 
in the judgment of those whose interest it is that the judg- 
ment be correct, a deficiency mthc King's Bench, to that 
other court, and that office in it which is best able to supply 
the deficiency, application will accordingly be made. If no 
such deficiency, then no such application. 

But, if in the King's Bench there be no such deficiency, 
ihen so it is that, in the King's Bench, the mischief in 
(question exists already in its full force.

In a cause in the Exchequer, inquiry at the hands of the 
officer by whom those jUrors are selected, it is in the books 
of practice stated (we have seen) a& being, on the part of 
th^ solicitor on each side, a matter of duty^ regularly re- 
earring and regularly fulfilled. That which, in the Excke- 
q[uer^ It is matter of duty to the solicitar to h^ inquisitive 
about, can it, in the King's Benck^ be matter of duty to him 
not to know ? 

In the Exchequer, the permanence being, by the Chief 
Judj^e, avowed and justified, the selecdon^^in a word tte 
packing — without yffhiiihWit permanence could not have been 
established — is thereby avowed and justified along with it. 
Of the matter of justification which^ in the judgment of the 
Chief Judge, is, in the Exchequer, so conclusive, is it 
credible that there should be any deficiency — ^and in a case of 
Ubel law too — in the King's Bench? 

To confound social order — to destroy the characters of all 
public men — to defame the justice of the country — to bring Go^ 
vernment itself into hatred and contempt'-'-Xonspracy to do all 
this and more— necessity of defeating it : — Ferment raised by 
wicked and artful men — necessity oj^ allaying it : — Respect for 
every thing that is respectable ^ on the point ^ being shaken off- — 
necessity of fastening it on. All these topics — with a thou- 
sand others equally conclusive — all of them in such well- 
exercised and skilful hands — can they fail of furnishing ar- 
gument enough, to justify (he adopting, in one court, a 
practice, which, with so complete a success, has so long

and shall see again and again, a corps of that description and character to have 
received for Exchequer service: 2. That though in the King^s Bench, and for 
Kxn^ Bench service, no such regular corps had been as yet put upon the esta- 
blishmenti a strong sense of the need which the service had of such a corps 
was entertained, and, in that Honouiabk Court, had accordingly fonnd extra

" As the nature of forming Special Juries^ (begins the note) " is not generally 
** understood, at least in the country, I shall malce no apology for introducing the 
<< following curious and interesting account of the manner in which they ar« se- 
"lected to the notice of my readers.— It is taken from the trial of John Home 
*' Tooke, Esq. for a Libel, u^die year 1777." 

'* The Special Juiy, (says Mr. Tooke) you may imagine are taken indiflb- 
** rently, and, as it may happen, from a book containing all the naiiies of those 
*• who are liable to serve ; I thought so when I read the A^t of Parliament ap» 
*' pointing the manner in which they should be taken. But when I came to at- 
'* tend to strike the special jury, a book with naines was produced by die ^eriff 't 
" officer ; I made what I thought an unexceptionable proposal. I desired the' 
*' master of the crown office (whom I do entirely acquit, and do not mean the 
" slightest charge uj^nj I desired the master of die crown office, that he would 
" be pleased to take the book, open it where he would, begin where he would, 
" at the top or at the bottom, and only take the first forty.e^ht names that

" could have nothing to object* I was mbtaken, he had something to object ; «

** he thought and proposed as the fairest way, that two should be taken out of 
" every leaf; that I objected to, I called that picking and not striking the jury. 
*' To what end or purpose does the law permit the parties to attend, if two are 
*' to be taken by the master of the crown office out of every leaf? "Why theii 
'* need I attend? two may as well be picked in my absence as in my presence; 
*' I objected tn that method; the master of the crown office did not seem* to 
" think that I had proposed any thing unreasonable : he began to take the 
** names ; but objected that he could not take the first forty-eight that came, be* 
** cause they were not all Special Jurymen; and that the names of common and 
** special jurymen were mixed together ; and that it would be a hard case that 
^'^the party should pay the expence of a special jury, and not have one; that 
** they were expected' to be persons of a superior r^nk to common jurymen ; I 
<« could have no objection to that provided they were indifTerendy taken. I saidi 
** take then the first forty-eight special jurymen that come ; he seemed to me 
** that he meant to do it ; he began, but as I looked over the book, I desired 
" him to inform me how I should know whether he did take the first-forty-eight 
** special jurymen that came, or not ; and what mark, or description, or quali- 
" fication, there was in the book, to distinguish a special from a coiirmion jury-

affected, the selection of the individuals, by whom, in the 
character ol jurymen , a check is supposed to be constantly,

power of the very person or persons, to whose power the 
authority of these assessors is supposed to operate as a check :

of damages" (concludes his Lordship) " it is so entirely and properly in your 
** province, a?id you are so in the habit of exercising your discretion upon thes^ 
" subjects, that I shall not say a word about it." 

Thus far the Lord Chief Justice. Th^ functions of special jurymen had there- 
fore, it should seem, become habitual to the Gentlemen to whom he was ad- 
dressing himself, and that to his Lordship's knowledge.

but disastrous /^at^^^Z-jA^a;? The Judge, b^i showman^ who,

^prt of case, in which his interests and passions are most 
deeply ^i&cted, i$ in e&ct Judge, sole Judge, ii^ his own 
pause.* 

I spoke of decorum. Yes, it i$ for bres^ches of decorum 
that, under a judicatory thus constituted, libell,ers (and who 
is tHere that is not a libeller ?) have so recently been crushed 
by punishments of such unexampled rigour : for a libel on 
tnt King^ imprisonment for two years: for libels on Judges 
(and let not the climax pass unnoticed)— for libels on Judges, 
parties and judges in their own cau^e^ — imprisonment for three 

f^ears with et c^tera^: — imprisonment to the destruction of 
ivelyhood in a scene of secluded penitence.t Nor let this be 

f That, for tl^e purpose of enforcing ol^edience to his own judicial orders, he 
j^er has been so, and, (subject always to eventual check firom some still higher 
fribunal) ever ought to he, is most indispu^ble : beuce the practice and propriety 
pf attachment for contempt. 

In Lord Mansfield's K%Bf under the convenient laxity of the vrord contempt, 
fin attempt was made to dctend procedure by attachment to the case of a Hbel, 
'^nrhen directed against a'Jud|;e. The nerves of Lord Mansfield failed him : that 
project was abandoned. At present, whatsoever other i^nts may be supposed, 
t>f 726^7^5 at least^ there is none. Bnt, so long as juries are what, according to 
Exchequer doctrine, they not only are but oyer ought to pe, to what use should a 
•project so full of trouble, if not of hazard, be revived ? 

•f* That on the propriety of this citTnax a judgment may be formed, let the fol- 
lowing brief observations be considered : 

}. In the whole field of government, there is net an abuse which could not« 
y^ithout any reflection on the personal conduct of the King;, be laid completely 
open, and receive its correction : in the particular field of judicature, there arfe 
few, if any, abuses, that could be fully brought to light, without reflection, in 
some shape or other, upon the personal conduct of the Judge. 

1^. The King, let him conduct himself as he may, cannot, while the constitu- 
Icn stands, be removed or suspended ; at least not without the concurrence of 
loth Houses of Parliament : a Judge, if he misconducts himself, may be f e- 
p^oved, on an address, by either House of Parliament. Can\assing the personal 
conduct of the ^ing has therjeforc a mischievous tendency, without any useful 
pne: while canvassing the personal conduct of a Judge has, on the other hanid, 
a useful tendency, without any pernicious one. To the prejudicp of a Judge, 
i^hatcver is said, has, even if it htjalse, this good eflfect— tnz. that it applies to 
his conduct the only efficient check of which in practice it is §usceptiblc—

Hi^e, can you really regard it, (it may be said) a prpbablc

them, be supposed to be regardless of English libertiss) w^ 
pp-severe in pursuing a course which^ in your ^^ of if^^ 
tpould be so completely destructive of English liberties r rpr--^ 
admitting that, under the ir^uence §f a sinister interest so con^^

follows not by any means that, to the sinister effect of j^uci, it^f^

been destroyed, there needs not any sort of conduct, to, 
which any such word as deprjmtyiQT any thing like it, is 
wont to be applied ;-^in a word, that there needs not, on 
the part of any one individual breathing, any thing which 
any man can reasonably be expected to be ashamedof. 

But, for the reader to be the more effectually impressed 
with the truth of this proposition, three other matters of fact 
present themselves as necessary to be borne in mind. 

}. That, with libel law in its freshest state—- the state in 
which it is declaredly ready and about to be enforced — ^^en* 
forced by punishments, the rigour of which has just been 
brought to view — the existence of a de facto liberty of the 
press, in any sense in which it is capable of operating as a' 
check to miscondact in any shape on the part of public

§ 1. Doctrines and Rules > 



A VIEWof libel law as it is, confronted with a view 
of what it!&ught to be, is destined for a separate publica- 
tion :' slight indeed, and consequently imperfect and inade- 
qiiate; ii'tl)e6nly. view that can be given of it here. But, 
without somiething under this head, of the most fatal of all 
the effects of the packing system — of that, in comparison 
of which all others put together are as nothing — not any 
ev<6n'th'e slightest conception could have been conveyed. 

Evfen the slight sample or two, ^ which h^ive incidentally 
presented themselves, may have been sufficient to induce a 
suspicion, and that not a lights on e^— that the treatment' 
which, undei the notion of law, has been given — and at ' 
this moment is ready to be 'given— to the press is, if per- 
sfevered in with any tolerable degree of steadiness, incoair 
pat;ible with every political — not to say moral — use of it. 
r A iundamentai sophism, from- which every other rule^ 
doctrine, or maxim, draws its mischief, is one that,"" from

halving never been announced in words^ is notxht'Uss^ but 
the more, mischievous. It consists i» confounding on thi« 
ground demAnd fir punishment with demand for disapproba-^ 
tien: or, what comes exactly to the same thing, assuming; 
that the «j/wj. being established, the other follows of course, 
" Is this priper ? Is this decent ? Is this endurable f^'^-^sk the * 
orator — ^reinforcing at every step the intensity of the dis- 
approbation, which: the appeal thus made, to the passions is 
calculated to call. forth: at the same time, in whatever de- 
gree, if in any, that hostile sentiment, be actually called 
iorthy. verdict of guilty is the verdict, the necessity of which " 
is thus constantly assumed, and which by the delusive force' 
of the assumption is but too constantly produced. 

Reducing this notion to a determinate /^r<9^(7J2Vi^«, with a 
correspondent practical rule, let us add to it a few others, 
expressive as far as they go, of the actual state of libel law : ' 
stating, under the head of each, the documents from which 
it has been deduced. Taken together, they will suffice, it 
is apprehended, to establish — and with a degree of evi- 
dence sufficient, at least, to the present purpose — that, un- 
der libel law as it is, prosecution and conviction are the same 
thing : and that, when a political Jibel is the offence, the 
form of jury trial is but a melancholy farce. 

1. A written and published discourse is a libel, and every 
person who contributes to the communication of it, punish- 
able in respect of it, if there be to^e found in it any pas- 
page or passages, the tendency of which is, in any degree, to 
expose government, i. e. any member or members of the 
governing body, considered in that character — to *• flfej- 
esteem.'' Rule — Punish whatever tends to bring a man in 
power into ** ^U(?j/(?€W.** \ 

2. or, in relation to any person in any high situation^ 

affording any inference, representing him as ill-placed in it, 
and questioning \\\^ fitness for it. Rule — Punish whatever 
imputes unfitness to any man in office. 

3. or which has had, or has tended to have, any' 

such effect as that of " prejudicing^' ** hurting,^* " injur^ '

more especially if his *' situation'* be a ** high'' one. Rule 
— Punish whatever hurts any body's '^^^ feelings,"

passage constitutes just cause for dislike, constitutes just and 
sufficient cause for punishment. Rul^^Punish whatever yon

§ 2. 1. RuU^ concerning Discs teem* 

Proof of the Rule. — Ch. Justice, p. 854. " It is no new 
*/ doctrine, that if a publication be calculated to alienate the 
" afiections of the people, by bringing the government into 
'hdisesteem, whether the expedient be ridicule or obloquy, the 
** person so conducting himself is exposed to the inflictions 
*^ of the law. It is a cri?ne. It has ever been considered as 
*! a crime: whether it be wrapped up in one form or another. 
' • The case of the King v, Tutchin, decided in the time of 
*l Lord Chief Justice Holt, has removed all ambiguity from 
?' this question." ^ 

Thus fiar the Lord Chief Justice. While these pages are 
writing, persons gut of number are amusing themselves 
with rendering what, I hope, appears to themselves, at least, 
§ood service to the country, by complaining of abu^es^ 



which U them appear as if existing in th^ gdv^rnmeht of 
it: and, to some at legist of these persons, theise abuses ap^ 
pear to have swelled to such a magnitude, a^ that nothing 
short of an alteration in the mode of representation in Par-^ 
liament, can operate as a sufficient k^medy. Have oi* hive 
not such proceedings, and such publicatioi^s, a tendency* 
not only to " bring the govetnment into A'sesltem^* but •« tb 
*^ alienate the affections of the feofW from soAiethihg or 
other, for example, {xoxxx a Parliament composed a$ at pre. 
sent ? If yes, and if, to any person so occupied^ it should 
happen to cast an eye upon thi3 pdge, I would beSeech hini 
to ask of himself Whether a cell in Dorchester of Gloucester 
jail be or be not zjit dbode for him— to consider iiiiiiethet 
he be in a state of jit. preparation for a visit of some year's 
length to either of thosie theatres of lavful reform — ^nd in 
what manner accommodation may in the most ^convenient 
manner be provided, in those or some other boardiilg-houies 
of the same class, for himself and the quantity of conlpany 
whom he ought to have there. 

Another hint to reformers — ^Among the situ^tibiis at the 
disposal of this noble and learned teachl^r of the aits of de- 
cency and candour — situations, the profit of which helps td 
constitute that part of his Lordkhip'^ rismilneratioh which is 
cdmposed of patronage^ is one, which in i797> produced 
from 1,200/. to 1,300/. a ytkr* part of the profit of which 
consists in the letting of lodgings; for Which it is ttpitof \i\i 
Lordship's occupation to prd^ide ibdg^rs. Amidft the d<k« 
mands, which the exeeutiob of the law tlulis detiiii^ated 
would, if executed with any thing like impartiality, bii pro- 
ductive ofj for accommodations in this and oiti^ auch

deavouring to secure some of the most conVetn^'At of these

3. ib " The question fbr your consideration i8, 

•' whether this paper is such as would-be injurious^ to the. 
"individuals, and whether," &c. 

4. P. 858. "It has been observed, that it is the right 
«• of the British subject to exhibit the folly or imbecility of 
•♦ the members of the government. But, Gentlemen, we 
•' must confine ourselves within limits. If in so doing in- 
*• dividucJ feelings are violcUedy there the line of interdiction 
'* begins, and the offence becomes the subject of penal visi- 
*' tation." 

5. ib. " If you are of opinion that the publications arc 
" hurtful to the individuals or to the government, you will 
" find the defendant guilty.** 

On putting together these passages, all out of the same 
speech — out of the same charge^ and that not a very long one 
— ^it seems evident enough that if they mean any thing, they 
mean this — viz», that it is a crime for any man to write any 
thing which it happens to any other man not to like: or more 
shortly, that if a man. publishes what he writes, under Lord 
^llenborough at least, it is a crdme to write. For, what pub- 
lished book was ever writtew^-^^xid, beipg written, reaa^ in 
which somebody or oth^er has not found something or other 
that be am not Hie :r^ivi /^/amjanguage, thd^b he did not Hie; 
PI. JP the l^pgMage^of avenging sentimentality^ that was not 
\^ injurious "^ ^\ prejudicial^*- \^^hurtful^'' or ^' violationar — 
add». fii^' further enrichment of the language, vulnerary to 
biipQfitp his feelings? 

;■ And .h^^, am I to know whether what I am writing ^n.d 
m^atiing to publish, will,^ or will not, mee^ with any roan 
to whose *^ feelings** it will be " injurious " and so forth? 
Why, by his prosecuting me or not prosecuting me. And 
if he prosecute me, what will be the consequence ? Why, 
that I have committed a crime, and must be convicted of 
course: for if his taking upon himself the expence and 
vexation of carrying on a criminal prosecution, be not a 
proof that his feelings have been injured, prejudiced, hiii% 
or violated, nothing else caa be. Therefore, as already ob- 
served, admit but this doctrine to be good law — (and, com- 
ing from the source from which it comes, how can it be 



oiherwist ?)'r^rosccution for a libel .is in fiveify 'pa^ 2/^y 
evidence that the paper prosecuteci for fr, a. libel, .^a^d. that 
evidence is cohclusive. . • * - 

The criteriQn — it must be confc|S6d-^hc criterion^hu^ af- 
forded, is an extremely simple one. No man can fail— K>r, 
at least, no man can long fail — to know, whether he.ij or is 
72^^ under prosecution. If then,* for. any thing ths^ lhj|vie 
written I am not yet prosecuted, what I have writteu U not 
as ypt a libel: if, for any thing in that wiy, I am already 
under prosecution, then it zj a libel. Such being th^e cri- 
tei-ion, . to the lioble and learned inventor nothing — it may 
well be presumed — can be more satisfactory. But to ut 
"without doors, who are as yet out of jail, and who, if wc 
did but know how, had rather continue at large than 
l)e. locked up in one, is there any and what course left 
open, for learning at any earlier point of time, whe- 
ther this or that article, which it would be satisfactory to ui 
to see made public, wijl or will not be productive of an ef- 
fect which to us would be so serious a one. 

A high sheriff, for example, or other chairman, of a 
county or other meeting, in which a set of resolutions are 
voted, imputing either ** Jolly or imbecility ,'* or corruption, 
to any of those Right Honourable persons to whom those 
qualities, or some of them, have of late in one or oth^r 
meeting of that sort been now and then imputed — any such 
presiding character, though not a ** great character y" wishr 
mg to give to these resolutions a certain degree of publicity, 
and at the same time not wishing to pass his time in a pri* 
Sony though it were for. no more than tkree^ or even For no 
more than two years — what is he to do ? 

For knowing what, on a given occasion, a man's feelings 
will be— or rather, and to come somewhat closer to the poin^, 
what on that occasion he will declare his feelings ta be — I 
know of one course and but one, which is — to put the 
question to himself. On this principle, to save circun^lo- 
cutory description, I will venture to submit to the consi- 
deration of such Gentlemen as it may concern the form of 
a Note^ which, short and simple as it is, may, it is^ humbly 
hoped, be found to be not the less well adapted to the 
purpose. X

** to infer^ that Lord Hardwicke is ill-plac«d in his h^k 
'* situation^ and that he is only Jit for the common walks oi

Thus far the Lord Chief Justice.— -Among ihe .persons 
just spoken of as being suspected— and surely not altogether 
without apparent cause — of endeavouh used to bring tht 
government into disesteem, I have pbserved some, by whom 
declarations have been made, expreteive of an opinion^^Hincl 
that too pronounced still more *^ charly" than in* the ww 
of " inference" — that Lord Viscourd CastUreagh, and the now 
ttiffhi nonourabk Spencer Perceval^-^he same Right. Hononr- 
abm person whom we then observed officiating, we have 
seen how, in the character of his Majesty's Attorney^GencM 
ral-— as being respectively somewhat '* iU^^aced** in one ot 
their <* high situations." After pssing eighteen months m 
prison for one of the two libels thus uttered, and made pub^ 
lie, the libellers, of whom I am speaking, are they prepsrei 
to pass another eighteen months, in the same place and con-« 
dition, for the other of these same libels ? 

Being a man that writes, or even though he be but .si 
man that thinks— whosoever prefers liberty to imprison* 
ment, safety to destruction, '* M him think of these things*'* 

** To douht thejitriess of kirn tuhom the Sovereign hath chosen^ 
•* borders near on sacrilege.** 

Such is the rule laid down by some learned Law-Lord, 
Chief Justice of the Emperor's Bench, in the time of the 
Emperor Justinian—" Saerilegii enitn est instar^ is quern Im* 
^* perator elegerit^ an dignus sit dubitare.** ff, 9. 29. 3. 

Of the constellation of " gi^eat characters" in " high 
situations,'' by whom the rule thus copied, and those others 
that match so well with it, have been called for and Idd 
doton^ let any one who dares, and who (to use the words o£

without the benefit of the Act called, in the newspapers, 
sbmeumes the Cutting Act, sometimes the Ellenborough Act, 
enjoyed in the course of his life the deaths of no fewer than 
70^000 of his subjects in the character of criminals — had 
the noble and learned godfather of that law been aS free to 
choose the time as he is the place of his circuits, would not 
the western circuit, anno 1685, have/ been a choice -more 
congenial to ^* Jeelings** such as his — than any circuit can 
now be in these degenerate days, ubi pro duritie ttmporum, 
as the learned anatomist so feelingly laments, vivos nbmines 
dissecari non licet: when, in plain English, such is the 
hardness, such the ferment of and in the times, that men 
cannot be found to be cut up alive for the amusement of 
learned eyes: so that noble Lords and Honourable Gentle- 
men, who have a taste Jer torture (understand for witness- 
ing it not for feeling it) are reduced to content themselves 
with such inferior yet never t6 be parted with gratifications, 
as the agonies' of bulls, dogs, ciats, and horses Can afford. 



§ 5. 4. Rule, concerning Dislike. 

Follows a list of qualities, which^ on the supposition of 
(heir being to be found in a discourse of any kind, have 
been stated bs> being of a nature to excite, in the breast of 
imy persoil, by whom it is heard or read, a sentiment 
of disapprobation or dislike: the existence of which, senti- 
ment has, by the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, or by 
the Attorney- General, with the concurrence of the said 
Chief Justice, been stated as constituting a sufficient war- 
rant for pronouncing such discourse (it being conisigned to 
writing) libellous, and for punishing with any number of 
ycacs imprisonment, b«ides other punishments, ev'ery per- 
son who,* in any way, has contributed to the communication 
of it. 

* : 1. fFant of fairness. 2. ff^unt of kberaiity, 3; Flippancy^ 
4. Deviation from decency. 5, Vnbecemingne^s. 6. Impro-. 



§ 5* 4» R^^^* concerning Dislike. gg 

priety. j. Slander ousness. %. Ill-nature* g. Want of can- 
dour, loi Tendency to ridicule, ii. ContradictorinesS'—viz. 
with refetence to matter of opinion advanced by another 
person. 

Follow now the correspondent passages serving as grounds 
of this doctrine — ^proofs of the existence of the correspond- 
ing rule. 

It cannot with reason^ and therefore, it is presumed, it 
will not be expected, that, on the occasion of every one of 
these qualities^ either the Chief Justice, or, under his al- 
lowance, the Attorney- General, shall, in precise logical form, 
be seen exhibiting, and re-exhibiting to the jury, an argu-, 
meiit in any such words as these^— wz. this quality exists *in 
the discourse in question— the quality, and, in respect ot 
it, the discourse will be regarded by you with disapproba- 
tion or //ij/zi^— therefore, in consideration of such disappro- 
bation or dislike, even although the discourse should be 
found to contain no other passage in it, having the effect of 
exciting, in your breast, the like sentiment, you will re- 
gard yourselves as bound to join, in pronouncing against the 
defendant, the verdict Guilty. 

That such, throughout, was their intention, may surely 
be regarded a^ placed sufficiently out of doubt by the fol- 
lowing considerations: — 

The purpose J ^nd sole purpose, for. which, on that occa^ 
sion, th« defendant was brought before the Jury, was — that 
it might be ascertained, whether, in respect of the discourse 
in question, he was, in the character of a libeller, guilty, 
and as such punishable. In any other view than thatof cotu 
tributing to this effect, had any thrng been, either by the 
Chief Justice or the Attorney-General, said of the discourse 
in question, it would have been irrelevant : and tiot merely 
irrelevant, but insidious^^tid injurious; having, for its object 
and tendency, the causing a man to be convicted, as fl it 
were criminal, on, account of a portion of discourse which, 
in their own opinions, was not criminal. Not but that, oii 
several of these occasions, the passage taken for the sub- 
ject of animadversion is, in express terms, pronounceH, bv 
one or other of these official persons, '* a libel'* or ** libel- 
•* lous:^* — and since, in this respect, no line of distinction n 
drawn between any one ot the passages so animadverted upon, 
and any of^r^* it will Purely not be regarded by any body, 
as a qaestion open to dispute, whether, among all these se- 
v'eraf qutiHties, and all these several corresponding passages^

there were dny one^ in respect of which it was not part of 
the design and endeavour, of the official pertoof in cues- 
tion, to cause the passage to be by the jury reput^ libellous ^ 
and the defendant dealt with accordingly in respect of it. 

The qualities^ successive!]^ ascribed to the various parts of 
the printed discourse^ and, in respect of which, it is sup- 
posed to be the design and endeavour of the spoken speech^ 
to cause the discourses to be considered as libdlous^ are 
hereinafter designated and introduced by the words quality or 
qualities. 

The passages respectively adduced to serve as proofs, 
that, on the occasion of each such respective mality^ such 
was the design and endeavour, are designated and intro- 
duced by the words pro^ ox proofs, 

I. Qualities, i. Ivant ofjaimess. s. Want of Uhera- 
Kty. 

Proof. Attorney-General, p. 827. " Now^ Gentle* 
'* men, is there anv thin^ in all this that can be called g 
*^Jair and liberal description of a public character ? 

II. Qualities, g. Flippancy. 4. Deviation from decency. 
Proof. Attorney -General, p. 827. •« Gentlemen, I have 

** already adverted to the indecency diTiA flippancy , of many 
** expressions made use of in this libel. It this libeller had 
*' been hurried away with the temptation of sa;^ing a flippant 
** thing, / should not have thought it a subject of crimi* 
*' nal prosecution. But, in the case before you, it is cri- 
** minal^ as indicating the spirit with which it was written, 
<* and as being descriptive of the ndnd of the man at the 
** time he was making them. I would not, however^ be 
*' understood to say, that even in the warmth of discussioh 
" upon public men and public measures, decency of language 
*' ought not to be preserved, and that dny deviation there* 
*' from is not punisnable. . . ." [Here the doctrine in ques- 
tion is directly avowed : by the Attorney-General avowed, 
^ and by the Chief Justice never contradicted : viz. that for 
every written discourse to which a deviation from decency 
can with propriety be imputed, a publisher is punishable.} 

III. Qualities. 5. Unbecondngness : and again Flip* 
phncy. 

Proof. Attorney-General, p. 828* " Surely no one who 
y has the least liberality of feelings could think it becoming 
'»• to taunt such a gentleman as Mr. Addington.'* [Taunt 
him, viz. by naming him by his father's title/j P. 828, ** I 
'" again say, that for any publication calling Mr. Addiag- 






) j. 4* Rute^ concerning DisUke. toi 

ton Doctor Addington^ or zny Jbfpancy of that nature, 
standihg by itself^ 1 should think it kncath the dignity of 
'* that Right Honourable Gentleman to make it the subject 
'* of a prosecution." N. B. Beneath bis dignity only, not 
(dfove his power* Learn we hence, that if at this moment, 
there exists out of a jail any such person as a newspap^ 
editor, or a political writer, on any other than one side, it 
is owing to the joint magnanirtiity of '* such a gentleman** 
as Mr, Ptrceoci^ and *• s^ch a gentleman** as Mr. Addington. 

IV. Qualities. 6. Impropriety (as intimated by the 
word ought.) 7. Slanderousness. 8. ill-nature. 

Proof. Attorney-General, p. 829. After speaking of 
divers passages in wnich Lord Hardwicke had been spoken 
of ^s being •• a good father^ a kind husband^ fond of litera* 
•* ture^ ana agricultural pursuits'^" " Qualities like these," 
(continues he) *' ought to have made'the libeller pause, be*, 
** fore be ventured to attack such a character* • • . • • 
•• Gentlemen, you must shut your eyes — if you do not sec 
*' that these amiable Qualities are attributed to Lord Hard* 
** wicke, with a slanaerous, with an ilLnatured meaning." 

V. Qualities. 9. fFdnt of candour. 

Proof. Attomey-General, p. 830. " Will any man 
believe that there ts any degree of candour in saying, that 
all tl^ has been done by the British government for Ir^- 

** land, is to send them a sheep*feeder from CambridgCf) 
*' shire, and a strong-built chancery-pleader from Linepln's* 
** Inn, when I tell you that • • . » Ireland » • . • is defended," 
&c. &c. 

Learn we hence, that whatever ** degree ^candour" there 
may happen to be in any given discourse, n is in the power 
of the Honourable Spencer Perceval (but whether in his 
character of Spencer Perceval," or in his character of At- 
tomey-General, that we are left to learn as we can) at any 
rate in the power of somebody— -and the safest conclusion 
seems to be, Jn the power of any «nd every man that is in 
power--to divest the discourse of such its candour^ an4 
thereby subject the author and publisher of it to punish* 
ment : and this by so easy a process as ** tding** fne jury 
any thing that shall have the eSect of a contratiiction to this 
or that part of the discourse. 

On tnis head, not a particle of Mr. Attomejr-Generars 
law, howsoever objectea to (as we shall see) by the defen* 
dam's counsel,* is dissented from by the Chief Justice: #n

the contrary, from what immediately follows, let any man 
judge, whether by implication at least — by necessary impli. 
cation — it has not, the whole of it, been coofiimecL 

VI. Qualities, lo. Tendency to ridicule* ., 

Proof. Chief Justice, p. 849. Upon .the above and 
other passages, the observation of the defendant's counsel 
{Mr. Adam) had been, p. 842, that " if the doctrine so laid 
** down were admitted .... the freedom of discussion, re- 
*^ lative to public men and public . measures, would de* 
** pend — not upon a point of right, but upon the taste of 
** the.Attorney-Gencrai :" and that " the controul which the 
** Attorney- General is" (thus) ** desirous of putting uppn it 
,** (the liberty of the press) would' go to extinguish it for 
*• ever," p. 842. 

' " Ridicule,"- he had afterwards contended, p. 849, ** is 
y a weapon which may be fairly and honourably employed, 
* *• especially when it is in the true spirit of English humour, 
"and for an object purely of a. public nature." After 
speaking of the nick-name of Carlo Khan^ formerly given 
to Charles Fox^ and the print of a colossus, comprehending 
all Scotland withiri the stride of its patronage— rw hen, after 
alducing these examples, he goes on to say, '* Lord Hard- 
" wicke is again represented as devoted to. agricultviral pur- 
•' suits," .... he finds himself thus iaterrupted by the 
Lord Chief Justice — 

" Do you maintain that a person has a right to ridicule his 
•' neighbour?'' — Mr. Adam. This is an information for a 
public libelf and not for private ridicule. LoRi> Ellenbo- 
ROUGH. *' I suppose you have some authority. .1 do not 
^•* wish to restrain your arguments, but it is a , -doctrine 
** which never was, and never can be, maintained*'' ' « 

Vn. Qualities. 11. Contradictoriness ;. viz*, when rndL- 
jiifested, in terms of a certain degree of strength, towards 
some proposition or propositions, that have been advanced 
by some one else. [N. B. In the instance in question, it 
was a mere matter of opinion, relative to the state of the na^ 
tion : not any specific matter of fact.'] 

Proof. Chief Justice, p. 856. Afterwards, in his 
charge, speaking of one of the sentences in the paper, his 
Lordship says, p. 856, *' Now the libels in this sentence 
•* are these" — thereupon, coming to one of them, he pro- 
ceeds and exclaims—-*** Is it to be endured, that it should be 
V said oiany person, but more especially of a person sitting

*• in the capacity of a Judge ^ that he had pdured a broad" 
'* side upon the truth oT the fact F' N. B. Sitting in the ca- 
pacity, of a Judge. Yes: so the Judge in question, Mr. 
Justice Osborne, was : but how? not hearing a cause^ 'hut 
haranguing upon politics* 

The disapprobation excited by this expression, in the 
bosom of our Lord Chief Justice, was, it seems, of such a 
strength as to be past endurance. A similar, if not exactly 
equal, sentiment is what he assures himself of 'finding pre- 
valent, in the. bosoms of the jurors, (the Guinea-men) to 
whom he is addressing himself: and on this sentiment it is 
ihat he relies as sufficient of itself to entitle him to expect, 
at their hands, a verdict of " Guilty,'* enabling him to sub*-i 
ject the victim to any number of years close imprisonment 
in'a scene of solitude. 

The word ** fction'* will of itself suffice to satisfy any . 
person, who can endure to looTc into Biackstone's Appendix; 
with the corresponding chapters, in this view, that in the 
universal scramble for fees, of which the jurisdiction of 
the Westminster*hall courts in its present state is the resulj^ 
the war was carried on in no other manner, and bynqpthet' 
arms, than by broadsides, which then wfcre, and stiH con- 
tinue to be, " pouted upon the truth pf facts,*' If theVi'any 
thing like consistency were to be expected among persons 
in such ** high situations" so far exalted above all need of 
consistency, and all fear of shame, long ago would ;*fevei!^p' 
man, who has ever vended, or in any other Mray contfibutca 
to the dissemination of the contents of Blackstone's Gonj- 
mentaries, have been prosecuted by the Honourable Spencer 
ftrceval, and convicted, as of course, by one of Lord Eljcn*- 
borough's juries. 

Signing a notorious falsehood — is this pouring ai broadside 
upon fact^ If so, is there a term^ in which broadsides are rtot 
poured upon facts by hundreds, not to say thousands^-^-pQurcd 
by the very hand of this very Judge, (with fees for the 
same)' or to his profit, and under his orders ? ' 

By the sinoak of these broadsides, have not the paths of 
judicial procedure been converted into^-^what they were 
meant to be converted into — 3 jungle, penetrable to the eyes 
of tygers, impenetrable to the eyes of suitors, who, such of 
them as do not perish in it, are dragged through it ? 

Before he was what lie is- — this noble and learned Lord 
Chiet Justice— was he not an Advocate? Does not the qc^ 
pupation ot an Advocate consist in pouring broadsides upon

« Hf^trk by the attorney, who brings him his brief with this 
or that number of euineas marked on the back of it ? 

Was not he a opecial Pleader f Knows be not what a

The distinction between the cases in which falsehood is

object, than the enabling well.paid marksmen to pour

*' declamation and invective, and were written not with a 
**' view to elucidate the truth, but to injure the character^ 
** of individuals^ and to bring into haired and contempt the 
*' administration of justice in the country." 

** The defendants were found guilty on this and a similar 
** information, and sentenced to three years imprisonment." 
Thus far the Reporter. The similar information was for a 
similar libel on Lord Ellenborough, the Lord Chief Justice. 

You, to whose imagination any such imprudent fancy 
should at any time present itself as that of taking for the 
subject of free '* discussion," under ftvour of any such 
licence, as above, the " decisions^* or the conduct of an^ 
English *' J^u6(gej*' would you know whether the expres* 
sions that have presented themselves to your pen are con*, 
sistent with the rules of *' decency and candour?" Go to the 
house of penitence at Dorchester or Gloucester— repent 
there for three years, or any such increased number of years, 
a$ for the allaying of the increasing ferment, shall have been 
deemed necessary* — repent, and when your course of peni* 
tence has there been rui^ through, perhaps even at the com- 
mencement of it, when beyond hope of mercy it has by 
your sentence been announced to you, then it is that you 
will be informed, and know all that it is^ intended you shall 
know. And what is that ? Not by what means those rules 
may, in all cases, be observed^ but by what means, in one 
instance, they have been violated. 

Behold then^ in the King's Bench, the royal school of de» 
cency: a school, the discipline of which has however this 
to distinguish it from ordinary schools — for example, from 
the other royal school within view of it — t/iz. that whereas 
in Dr. Carey's school, instruction comes first, and then, 
in case of transgression, if the transgression be wilful and 
perverse, perhaps correction afterwards, stripes, say half a 
dozen — in Lord Ellenbor oughts school, correction, orperad- 
venture, under the name of correction, destruction, comes 
first ; and it is from this correction or this destruction, that, 
for the first time^ and without the possibility of learning it

Ir, by competent and acknowledged legislative authority, 
and in and by any determnate, assemblage of determinate 
words, such as are the words of every act of parliaments 
maxims', even siich as those that we have been seeing, were 
consigtied to writing and established — established though it 
it were in these very words^ — the very words that we have 
just seen — the condition of Englishmen would be a condi- 
tion of security, in comparison.of what it is at present. 

But by no such fcthority, in no such determinate for,m of 
words,- has this. part of the rule of action as yet been, or 
will arty part of it ever be, established ^ndfxt, that Judge 
and Co. are able to prevent from being thus fixt,* 

Under such law — (the abuse here made of the ^erm law 
must be tolerated, for it is inevitable^— r-under such law, ser 
curity may be talked of, and even fancied, but, for any 
man who either piiblishes a newspaper (not to speak of 
pamphlets) or contributes to the communication of its con-r 
tents, security itself cannot, with truth, be said to hi^vjj 
existence. Thus much for actual danger. 

Now as to alarm — terror — rthe inseparable conseauence oi

♦ When, on any part of the field of law, the security of the subject is at its

Accordingly libel law, such as we have been seeing it, having, in a very high 
place, been but t'other day brought to view, absolute perfection was declared tQ 
be aiuong the number of its attributes. Declared ? and by whom ? This is qf 
the nurnber of those things which it may be rather more easy to learn than safe 
to indicate.

will be the quejstion, which, under the darkness visible at 
which we have been taking a glance, any man, into whose 
mind any such speculative; theoretical, and Jacobinical^ 
cohception, should have^ entered, as that of attempting to 
bring to light atiy abuse, the theatre of which is to be found 
in any part of the system of judicial procedure, will of 
course be tormenting hiniself. The answer will be deter- 
mined—partly by the incidents, which chance has presented 
to his notice, partly by the strength or weakness of his nerves* 

In this state of law, bribery excepted, among those ivhich 
concern the administration of justice, exists there that enor- 
mity which a Judge— I mean an English Judge, one of the 
legislating twelve — by committing or even oy confessing , 
would expose himself to any the slightest danger-— 1 do not 
say of punishment — the supposition would be too extrava- 
gant"— *but so much as to any expression— any the faintest 
expression of regret — such as majorities know so well how 
to frame — that it had not been otherwise ? Confessing would 
he obtain credence ? . 

Not long ago comes out a Newspaper, announcing a series 
of Letters, to be addressed to the Lord Chief Justice of the 
King's Bench : — letters, which were to have presented to 
his Lordship's notice abuses upon abuses, the scene of 
which was to have been laid in his Lordship's court, or in 
which at any rate practitioners in that court were 10 have 
been represented as actors. In the character of an intro^ 
duction, the first of the announced letters crawls out:-i-no 
other follows it. Whence this sudden death ? That which 
history refuses to disclose, must be supplied by another 
h^nd. Between the first letter and the day which should 
have brought forth the second, in the hour which should 
have been that of repose, the pillow of the publisher re-

ctx9t% a shake, the united curtains separate, and behold! 
at the bed's feet a grimly spectre — wrapt up in clouds pf 
artificial hair, ill-concealing the streams of gore which are 
seen issuing from woundecTfeelings. In its uplifted hands 
is displayed a terrific scroll, exhibiting a plan and elevation 
of each of the two lately consecrated abodes of sequestered 
penitence, with Mene tekel and Utrum horum in flam- 
ing capitals, garnished with fragments of sentences, about 
cmtempt of government^ high situation^ et catera^ and so 
forth, scrawled upon the walls. 

After' such warnings-!— and where is the literary pillow 
that is not visited by them ? — suppose for argument sake 
— and it is only for argument sake— suppose Lord £llen> 
borough to have done any of those things which Lord M^c^ 
elesfield^ or even any of those things which, alas! Lord 
Bacont did before bim — suppose him to have squeezed 
CUrks as Lord Macclesfield did Masters: — suppose' him, 
like Lord Macclesfield, to have sold places under himself 
which it belonged to him to check — or (supposing it more- 
over unlawful )< — suppose him, instead of selling them to a 
disadvantage, to have listened to the suggestions of a more 
improved economy, and pocketed the whole profit in the 
lump. 

Suppose— but what end would there be to such supposi^ 
tionsr 

In such a state of things, among those elected Guardians 
of Justice, if any such there be — »to whom economy, so 
displayed, and on such a theatre, would appear a fitter ob« 
jcct of reform than imitation or confirmation^ is there any 
one that would hear of it ? — Is there any one that, in print 
at leasts would tell of it ? — Not unless a situation in Glou- 
cester or Dorchester jail — and that a safe and permanent one 
— safe as saft^custody could make it— ^permanent as a lease 
for years could make it — had become the object of his 
choice.

be found at any time in company with almost unexampled 
fortitude. But how much more likely, by the uncaodid» 
the incorrect, the violent? Vices like these, when exem- 
plified in the supposed libel, have the)r or have they not any 
such effect as that of enhancing the mischief, if any, whica 
is liable to be produced by it ? The answer i« not altogether 
clear: but, at any rate, it is on the supposition of the aflir* 
matiye, that the proportions, generally given to the intetif- 
sity of invective, seem to be grounded. 

But It is truth, not violence, that has been the real ob- 
ject of terror and hostility, to the creators and preserveri of 
English liiet law: and thus it is, that whi^, under the spur 
of indignation and desperation, violence and exaggeration, 
burst forth. Truth — gentle and simple Truth — ^remains at the 
bottom of her weU^ without daring to peep out.

MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE. 

^ I. Unoisequiousness found unaiuoHaUe by a veteran 

Advocate. 

IN zny published written discourse, taking for its subject 
the propriety of pubtic measures, or of the conduct of pub^ 
He men, whatever merits disapprobation^ presents ^n ade^ 
quate demand for punishment. This principle being either 
expressly laid down or assumed, and juries habituated to 
accede to it, and act in conformity to it, it seems not Vfery 
easy to conceive what that published discourse can be, to . 
which, if written on any such subject as that in question,^ a 
jury, even though it were not a draught from the sekct and 
secret qualified list ^ would, on any tolerable ground of pro- 
bability, be expected to refuse to attach a verdict of con- 
viction. Yes: if so it be that, in the alledged libel that . 
lies before them, there be not one of them that can find an 
expressioi^ or a word which he feels himself disposed to 
disapprove : viz, neither on any such score as decency i or it- 
berabi^^ or candour ^ or propriety^ and so forth, as above :— and 
what if he can not ? O^ly that in that case, for tapporting a

verdict of conviction, then some other ground must be 
looked out for, of which, while such doctrioes as have 
just been. seen are acceded to, whether it be possible there 
should be any deficiency, the reader may now judge. 

If, in thfe evenf of his entertaining in relation to any pas- 
sage thus brought under his revie>v, any such emotion as 
that of dis^pprobatiqn or dislike^ it would afford to his feel- 
ings any gradficatipn to b^ contributory to the subjecdng 
the delinquent to punishment^ in such case, whether a juror 
will no.t find, in these ;established doctrines, an amply suffi- 
cient tuarrantt for the.af^rding this gratification to the 
irascible part of his frame, may be seen already. 

But, whether inclined or not inclined, will it be in hi$ 
power to avoid it ? — In his power ? physically or metaphysi- 
caJly speaking, yes :— but, to keep clear of metaphysics and 
every thing that ends in — ism^ pradically speaking — what- 
ever be the state of a juryman's inclinations, can there, 
for any proposed writerK>n-^>W»^W-^f legislation^ which is as 
much as to say for any proposed libeller — can there be any 
rational hope or prospect, of witnessing, on the part of any 
such juryman, any suirh forbearance? 

The degree of probability in question cannot, it is evi- 
dent, but be, in a high degree, influenced, even if not in 
one event converted into moral certainty^ by the mode of 
address pursued by the directing Judge : by the degree of 
freewill which it may please this creator to have left or not 
left to his habitually obedient creatures. To learn if possi- 
ble a thing so necessary to salvation, let us open the book of 
history t that in it we may behold the words of prophecy^ and 
read in it the eventual doom that is in store for us.*

*• to the publication itself being a libel i^'-^the fact is incon-

is a curious one : and in the answer may be seen a confirraa-r 
tion of the moral impossibility of any verdict other than 
that of guilty at the hands of a jury of Guinea-men, not to 
say of any men, so directed. 

On the trial of the other defendant, in regard, to some 
parts at least, if not the whole-, of this multifarious libel, a 
*^ question'' of this sort had, as we have seen^ been made: 
ihade, and by the same 'learned Gentleman, wlio after hav- 
ing been leading counsel for the political writer, officiated 
now in the same character for the culprit Judge. The ques- 
tion having been made then^ how comes it not to be made 
now t 

On that former occasion the authority which the learned 
counsel had to contend with, was no other than that of a 
sirfgle Judge : on this present occasion, the authority before 
which he has to plead, is that of the entire judicatory :— a 
judicatory, composed of four Judges, of whom the Judge 
m question, though in authority the Chiefs was in number no 
more than one.

jhat under such direction obsequiousness was a virtue not 
confined to the jury-box — or a casual deficiency of ner-

than the unlearned, are liable to — or that, even where there

countenances are day b^ day to be encountered-— so k is 
that there being, according to the learned counsel's own 
statement at least, nothing more at stake than !' the liberty 
of the press" — that liberty which, as he had observed, " has 
•< ever been held as one of the first principles of the con^ 
*' stitution" — nor from the doctrines, acainst which, on 
that former occasion, he had with so little fruit been con-

tingui^ing of " that liberty for ever'* — whatsoever may 
have been the cause of the abandonment, so it is that be- 
fore this re-inforced, and ck jure at least superior, judica* 
tory, the contest was not renewed.

bosom even of the most obdurate Judge — what, under such 
direction, could have been or ever can be — expected, for 
the relief of a defendant libeller, or for the preservation of 
' the about to be ** extinguished liberty"— what, I ask, can, 
to any such purpose, be, with any the least colour of rea- 
son, expected^ from the firmness — let us not say of the 
craving Guinea-man, who, in one unacceptable verdict, be- 
holds the extinction of the race of his expected guineas— 
but of any gentleman habituated (as by the discipline of the 
Bhckstone school all gentlemen are habituated) to regard in 
emry word that cometh from the mouth of one of the re-

each of, them more simple in its composition, might, in 
cases of libel law, so long as libeWaw stands as it is at present, 
viz. without any determinate set of words for the expression 
of it, be substituted (it should seem) and with no inconsi- 
derable advantage to liberty and justice, 

1. One of them is — a Stdr-chambet : in a word the an* 
tient judicatory of that name, revived, with or without 
amendments. 

It was in that judicatory, that libel law, as it stands at 
present, received its Jbrm an J tenor : viz. in so far inform 
and tenor can be attributed to a species of law — viz. unwrit-m 
ten^ alias common^ alias Judge-made law — of which the es. 
sential character is the not having any tenor at all belonging 
to it, nor consequently any purport of any such solidity as 
that certainty and safety can be built upon it. It was in that 
judicatory that the earliest cases extant — being those which, 
in the cnaracter of the foundations of libel law, are conti* 
nually referred to — were determined. , 

Oi that transcendent judicatory, the acknowledged fruit 
of which was " the keeping, of all England in a state of. 
*' quietude," pure of all fermenting matter, one great ad* 
vantage was the being composed altogether of persons in 
•* high situations'* — " great characters** — whose greatness, 
so long as it. pleased the fountain of all greatness, was 
placed out of all danger of failing, being fixt by office* 

Though, under special jury law, it does belong to the de- 
fendant to choose, out of 48 persons fixt by a very different 
choice, by what 12 he shall not be tried, it does not under any 
law. belong to a defendant to make choice of any of the 
Judges by whom he shall be tried. But, for my part, sup- 
posing for argument sake, that it rested with my choice, 
pnore willingly would I be tried ^ and (being of course con>- 
victed) sentenced^ by a Star-chamber composed of the same 
great characters as heretofore, than, under such direction, 
tried before a jury, of whom it should happen to me to know 
thus much and no moxt—^viz. that they were so appointed 
and so paid: — a sentence all the while awaiting me from 
such a source, and of such a nature, as, by the examples 
that are under every body's view,' has been rendered so in* 
telligible. 

In the case of the libel in question — the libel composed 
of the letters ^\gntdi Juvema — the ^^ great characters,** men- 
tioned in the title of Mr.. Cobbett's trial as objects of that 
libel, are " the Earl of Hardwicke, Lord.Lieutenaat of

To these may be added — as so many persons, over whose

nimity, partly by that of " the Attorney- General of our 
•* present Sovereign Lord the King, who for our said Lord

Earl Camden) — and the then Right Honourable Henry Ad^ 
dington, now Viscount Sidmouth, and in the said libel so 
" unbecomingly taunted" by being called by the title of his 
father *• Doctor Addington.'^ 

The purpose for which this constellation of great charac- 
ters is here introduced is no other than that of saying, that, 
it being, by the supposition, my misfortune to be under pro* 
secution for a libel against all those several great characters 
— and at the same time my advantage and privilege to have, 
for my trial and sentence, the choice of a Star-chamber^ in 
lieu of a jury so constituted and directed as aforesaid — my 
choice would be in favour of the said Star-chamber: and 
this, even supposing the constitution of it to have received 
ihis — I know not whether to call it confirmation or amend* 
ment — to wit, that of its being composed, in the character 
of Judges^ of the very same persons, neither more nor 
fewfr, as those whom, by the hypothetical and argumenta- 
tive mention thus made of their names, it may, for aught I 
know, at a time when to write h to write libels^ have already 
happened to me to have libelled. 

Neither caprice nor rashness dictated the choice thus 
made. 

Judging thus openly and avowedly in their own causes- 
executing the operation of conviction ^n^ punishment^ at the 
same time and with the same hands — this apparent ^ as well 
as real union, of functions, at present so erroneously sup* 
posed to be disjoined, would bo sufficient to point towards

them the attention of the public eye: weak as every check 
must be, the action of which is to be conveyed up into so 
high a sphere, some check, and that a real one, they would 
have: whereas, in the existing case, while the phantasmago- 
ric vision of a check displays itself, of the reality no itgns 
have ever yet been visible.

case, as above, in comparison with a jury so constituted 
and directed, 1 should not hesitate to give the preference, is 
a single-seated judicatory, consisting of a Judge, without a 
jury: and this, even without excepting the noble and learned 
Judge, under whose direction ^Ae/iiry-^^^, for the reasons 
already so distinctly stated, would, in my mind, oppose so 
insuperable a bar to Hope. 

To those, if any such there be, to whom an object of 
such inconsiderable imj^ortance as the actual state of judica- 
ture, when delineated by so obscure a pen 98 the present, 
may have already presented itself to view, the considera- 
tions by which, in the character of reasons^ [See Scotch Reform) 
this choice is dictated, will, if not already brought to view, 
at any rate be sufficiently apparent — it being, in one word^ 
of the nature of responsioility (in the burthensome sense of- 
the word) to go on diminishing c/ infinitum^ in proportion 
as the number of those who are sharers in the burthen is tn- 
creased: not that if the same learned Judge, by whom the 
jury would, in the case supposed, be directed, and of course 
directed to convict me, I could, as far as conviction goes, 
entertain any rational expectation of any better fate. But^ 
the fate of the defendant being, in the case supposed, placed 
so manifestly as well as completely in his hands, what in 
that case I should hope for, is— some mitigation in the ri- 
gour of my sentence. Not that by the non-existence of a 
jury — not that by a circumstance so completely_foreign to 
the consequences and tendency of the offence — any defalca- 
tion could be made from the real demand for punishment: 
but that, in some way or other, more readily felt than de- 
scribed, the like effect might, in some degree, be pro- 
duced by prudential considerations.

CHAP. I. Introduction — ^Two reforming 

Shrievalties, 

§ 1. Turner and Skinner, anno 1783-4. 

XN the year 1784, Sir Barnard Turner, and Mr. Thomas 
Skinner, (See City Characters J the late celebrated auctioner, 
afterwards Alderman of London, finding themselves Sheriffs 
of London and Middlesex, charged as such with duties of no 
irtconsiderable importance, conceived what to many grave 
and learned persons of that time, friends to social order and 
our holy religion, was looked upon of course as a theoretic 
and speculative fancy; viz* that of making things ** ^e/Z^r 
♦* than well," by applying their minds to the fqlnlment of 
those same duties. The state of things appertaining to that 
department having presented itself to their eyes as being in 
divers particulars susceptible of improvement, they made in 
that view what arrangements had occurred to them as being 
in their own power, and in a tract of forty 8vo pages*— 
gave an account of what they had done themselves, toge« 
ther with a statement of such other things as, if donp by 
others, presented, in their view of the matter, a prospect of 
being of use.

lao Chap. I. htroducttori'^Two r^orming Shrievalties. 

In addition to some regulations, partly executed partly 
recommended, having for their objects the health and good 
behaviour of prisoners, the changes thus spoken of under 
the dame of *' alterations and amendments^*' consisted of 
three innovations, one respecting the disposal oi goods takea 
in execution in civil actions, the two others respecting the 
place and mode of putting criminals to death. 

1. On their entrance into the shrievalty they had found 
lodged, by customary negligence, in the hands of the she. 
riflFs* officers, a class of men, whose hearts are universally 
recognized as standing, in a peculiar degree, exposed to the 
inroads of hard hardness and corruption, the function of 
nomifliting persons, at whose disposal, in the name and 
character of appraisers^ goods taken in execution were regu* 
larly placed by these their patrons: and of the general re- 
sult of ihis arrangement a tolerably adequate conception 
may be formed from one individual case, in which, accord- 
ing to the report given of it by these sheriffs, the value of 
the property so taken, being about ^z;^ times the amount of 
the debt, and the whole having been taken from the debtor, 
no more than a tithe of it, znz. half the amount of the debt, 
had found its way into the pocket of the creditor ; the other 
nine-tenths, having, in some regular and established, but 
unascertained or at least undivuked proportions, been 
shared between the minister of justice, and his official no« 
minee and associate above-mentioned. 

To this grievance the remedy they applied was one which 
though, in principle, and in the character of a regularly 
established remedy, applicable by all persons, on all occa- 
sions, not altogether an unexceptionable one, proved, in the 
individual hands in question, there is reason to think, a bene- 
ficial one: the nomination which they had found, as above, 
in the hands of their officers, was taken out of those low- 
stationed and impure hands, into their own : and forasmuch 
as in that. station men are not only too highly and conspi- 
cuously elevated, but moreover too frequently changed, to 
be much in danger of engaging with success in the organi- 
zation of any regular plan tor the extraction of lucre from 
so impure a source, the mischief if not altogether eradica- 
ted must naturally have been considerably diminished. 

On what footings the matter stands at present, it has not 
fallen into my way to learn. At that time, as the evil genius 
af the discarded functionaries would have it, both sheriffs 
were upright as well as public-spirited men : and Skinner^ 



^1* Turner and Siznner^ anna ijZ^'^.* isii 

being* in relation to the branch of business in question* in 
a pre-eminent degree an intdligeni one, knew where to find 
his UAe, 

At present the magnificent edifice, now erecting in the 
center of the city under the name of the Autdon Mart, 
presents the idea of a more radical cure. 

2.'-On the ground of capital punishment, iht place and 
mode of execution furnished to these reformers two othei^* 
opportunities for casting their honest mite into the treasurjr, 
ot justice. 

On those melancholy occasions, on which to save the 
trouble of reforming them, and adjusting punishment in* 
quality as well as quantity to delinquency, malefactors of 
the most diversified descriptions are involved in one indis* 
criminating destruction, the operation was in those days vt* 
gularly preceded (it seems not easy to say why) by a pro- 
cession of two or three miles length, in the course ot which, 
whatever effect could have been expected from the conclad* : 
ing tragedy was more than countervailed by the intervening' 
disorders. StrUck with the incongruity of this surplusage 
of loco-motioni our reformers fixed the ceremony to the^ 
well-assorted spot to which it remains attached at present :; 
a spot immediately contiguous to th« place of confinement 
from which the victims then used to be, as tbey still are, 
taken for the appointed sacrifice. 

At that same time, the fatal operation being performed, 
as mechanicians say by hand, was performed in that coarse * 
and uncertain mailner, by which the sufferings of the pa. ^ 
tients were exposed to receive unintentional increase. It* 
was to this happily associated pair of humble and unambiti* - 
ous reformers, that the machinery, now applied to that pur- 
pose, and still known by the almost burlesque but sole ex* 
isting name of the New Drop owed its establishment. Un* 
der English justice, the intended object, as well as effect of 
it, corresponds exactly with that of the Guillotine, under the ' 
anarchical tyranny of revolutionary France. For, in the 
design of the humane, as well as scientific, inventoif, whose . 
name it h^s perpetuated, that instrument (a French edition 
of our Halifax Maiden) had no other object than that of 
diminishing, in each instance, the suffering produced by 
those executions, the multitude of which depended Dn other 
hands. 

To any one who has been accustomed to observe how 
slow, in every department of govepmeol» from the highest

down to the lowest, the pace of reform is, and how thkkly 
beset 'with obstacles the paths which it has to traverse, it 
may be apt to appear difficult to conceive by what strange 
accident, even in so low a sphere, a change, which had for 
its result, as well as for its object, the good of the many, 
should haVe been suffered to take effect. 

As to the innovation which consisted in the disturbance 
.given to the official arrangement, by which so quiet and re- 
gular a division had been made of the property of the 
debtor between the officer and the appraiser — in the fact of 
its having been suffered to take effect, and that too without 
^position from above, he may behold a certain proof of 
two things, viz. i. That therfe was no individual existing in 
any such station as that of a Judge or other considerable 
Law-officer, into whose hands so much as a single penny 
of the profit that used to be thus extracted was ever felt to 
have found its way; and that, in jparticular, if in the dispo- 
sal of any of the property in question any errors were ever 
committed by any one of these inferior ministers of justice, 
no Chief Jiistice of the King's Bench had ever considered 
himself as having gained, or conceived himself as being in 
a way to gain, to the amount of 1,434/* 15J. 6d. a year, or 
any part of that sUm, nor any Chief Justice of the Com- 
mon Pleas 733/' B-^' 11^' a year, or any part of that sum, 
nor any Attorney-General that or any other sum, by con- 
tributxng to the manufacture, or effecting or permitting the 
correction of any of these errors: 2. That neither did there 
exist among any of those exalted personages, any individual 
whose pride had found itself by any accident engaged in the 
protection of the abuses, or inconveniences thus removed, 

. 3. As to tne procession from Newgate to Tyburn, the 
thieves, whose practice found itself diminished by the abo- 
lition of this ceremony — these unlicensed depredators, not 
one of whom ever had or ever would have found any diffi- 
culty, other than from want of money, in his endeavours 
to purchase a toss up for impunity on pretence of some er- 
ror, bearing no more rational a relation to his case than to 
that of the Jirst homicide^ found themselves unable in their 
conjunct capacity to make any such case as on the ground 
of precedent would, in point of decency, have warranted 
any gentleman of the long robe, in the character of Judge, 
Counsel, or Member of Parliament, to stand up in support 
pf it.

destined to be relieved by it, not having found, in a long robe 
or in any hi^h situation, any person possessing any such in^* 
terest in their continuance, as is possessed by such a multi* 
tude of personages in high situations and long robes, in the 
continuance of the living agonies of so many thousands who 
are kept so regularly immured in forced idleness, by their 
authority and for the sake of their profit and their ease, and 
the only persons whose co-operation towards this reform 
was necessary, being the Surveyor and the Carpenter^ whose 
sensibility to the advantages of it was beyond dispute, thus 
it was that this reform too found its way into existence un-^ 
opposed. 

In a word, barring opposition from superior power, ac- 
complishment being within the power of the reformers 
themselves, and no interest intervening in any tangible 
shape to call down opposition from above, the reforms, 
such as they were, were carried into effect. 

By these circumstances, when rightly considered and put 
together, the known facts of the case may be found to stand 
divested of that air of fable, by which, to a first glance, 
they may have seemed obscured. 



§ 2. PhiUips and X. Anno iBoy-B. 

From that year (1784) to 1807, Nature took ^ime to rest 
herself: and, in all those three-and-twenty years, though of 
ahuse, in a considerable variety of shapes, there cpuld not, 
during any part of that time, have been any deficiency, it 
appears not that in the series of worthy and respectable gen- 
tlemen, who succeeded each other in that office, there had 
been so much as one, to whom the idea had occurred, oJF 
occupying himself in any such theoretic and speculative task, 
a^ the attempting to make any defalcation from the mass : 
no — not a thought about any such matter, in the breast of

in any degree, or by any body, neglected— j&ractfc^!, to wit 
in essentiMSi such as going to court, riding about in a gilt 
chariot, giving and eating dinners, and the like. 

Africa, in times of old, had the reputation of producing 
cuch singularities as could be exhibited on four legs. In 
modern times, England has among nations been noted for 
producing singularities on half the number of legs. 

In the shrievalty year 1807-8, the spirit of retorm having 
passed, as hath been seen, three-and-twenty years of repose 
on the pillows, or in the graves, of Sir Barnard and Mr. 
Skinner, made its appearance, in the character of a Giant 
refreshed, in the body of Mr. Phillips, a publishing book- 
seller of the first eminence, who, on receiving rrom his 
Majesty's sword the cnstopiary honour, changed his appel- 
lation into that of Sir Richard Phillips. 

In the nature of the shrievalty there is a sort of mystery^ 
in consequence of which he, who does not look well to his 
words, and even he who does, will be in continual danger 
of falling into one or other of two heresies^ which, like 
Scylia and Charybdis, lie in wait for him, one on the side of 
grammar, the other on the side of legal 2tnd curious learning. 
In London and Middlesex, taken together, there is never 
one sheriff ouXy, there arc always two sheriffs. The same 
two respectable gentlemen who, in the City of London, 
constitute two sheriffs, and thereby two persons, constitute, 
in the County of Middlesex, but one sheriff, and thereby, 
in legal abracadabra, like man and wife, but one person: — 
or else vice versa: — for, such is the frailty of unlearned me- 
mory, that as often as, in relation to this article, one minute 
finds me in possession of orthodoxical truth, the next minute 
finds me dispossessed of it. 

In the artificial and involuntary fraternity contracted by 
him orn this occasion, it was not the lot of Sir Richard to 
find anytsuch felicity as that which had attended Sir Barnard 
and Mr. Skinner. 

Bishop Bujnrtet — or if not he some other self-reported 
eye-witness, whose name, if found, would not, to the pre^ 
sent purpose, add much to the stock of our useful know- 
ledge, tells us of a pair of twins whom he saw living in 
Holland, and whose misfortune it was to stand connected 
by bonds of fraternity closer by much than either of them, 
wished ; viz. by 2Vi adhesion of some sort or othef, in the 
region of thie back-bone, constituting thence, instead of 
fwQ bipeds^ one unfortunate quadruped. 



( t* Phillips and X. Aimo i%OT-%» itf 

At the age oT about twenty, one person of this unhap- 
pily connected pair paid the debt of nature. The conditioa 
of the survivor is too deplorable to be dwelt on any where^ 
especially in this place. All that is here wanted of him is 
to serve as a type of one half of our quadruped, or double 
biped sheriff. 

In bis pilgrimage through the thorny region of reform. 
Sir Richard was not long ere he founa himself in the dii^ 
astrous plight above alluded to. Into the body of his twin 
colleague, Mr. x, either the beneficent spirit above spoken 
of had never made its entrance, or had soon made its re« 
treat, leaving it in the condition of .a carcase, which, if not 
dead in law^ was dead to the purpose of rendering, in any 
degree, less pernicious the condition of the law. At every 
3tep he took, our Knight found himself with this everlast- 
ing colleague at his back, exhibiting, in no other form than 
that of the vis inertia^ except now and then a kick or two, 
Uny signs of life. 

As to Mr. ;c, I borrow, on this occasion for his use, one 
of the names employed by mathematicians for the de« 
signation of their unknown quantities^ not thinking it neces- 
sary to him to possess any other introduction to ** Prince 
** Posterity'' than what he has secured to himself by his 
own picture, as drawn by himself and published by Sir 
Richard, in that work of his of which mention has been al- 
ready made. 

As to Sir Richard— what things he did— what other things 
he tried to do, and would have done, but for the giants and 
dragons' he had to encounter in his way— all the while with 
this ipass of proud flesh at his back — matters of that sort 
belong not exactly to this place : any more than the sort of 
requital he met with, in another character, (see p. 117) from a 
pair of learned brethren, whom he found so much more per- 
fect in the art of ^' dwelling together in unity," than he ai^d 
his. 

Of the list of his achievements and less successful en- 
deavours, one alone belongs, by any direct title at least, to 
this history: — wz. the discovery, made by him, of the pitch 
of perfection, at which the art of packing (that master art of 
which the elements have been endeavoured to be delivered 
as abovej has been carried in the application made of it to 
special juries. 

•Beholding in the Court of Exchequer, as above, the great 
manufactbry or workshop, in which it was carried on, and 
s^ing more to admire in the ingenuity displayed in it, than 



ift6 Chap^IL The Sheriff to the Lord Chief Baron — Noficeu 

in the purposes to which he saw it applied, he addressed a 
letter to the chief conductor of that important branch of busi- 
ness, noticing the state of the art, together with such obser- 
vations as had been suggested by it. 

At this time he was either charitable enough to suppose-^ 
or, (what seems the more probable interpretation of the two) 
decorous enough to sum to suppose ^ that the mode in which 
the business was conducted was a secret to the pre-eminently 
learned as well as skilful person, under whose auspices and 
authority, he found it going on. But, if such was ever 
really his belief, it. was not long before he found himself 
obliged to take his leave of it. 



CHAP. IL Th£ Sheriff to the Lord Chief Baron — 

* Notices. 

^ 1 • Substance of the Letter, 

FEW, simple, and important, will be %t,^n to be the 
statements made by this sheriff to the Lord Chief Baron.— 
After the Substance of each statement, follows an intima- 
tion of the sort of answer given to it. 

1. That in the Judicatory, over which the Lord Chief 
Baron presides, juries are become virtually permanent : and 
that the Lord Chief Baron knows they ar^. Of this state 
of things the Lord Chief Baron admits the existence ; and 
moreover, as will be seen, justifies it. — Say, admitted and 
justified. 

2. That this permanence is contrary to an acknowledged 
principle of the Constitution, and considered by the public 
as such. — Not denied. 

3. That it is contrary to the express provision of an Act 
of Parliament [4 Geo. 2. c. 7. ^ 2.] — Not denied. 

4. That the permanence has packing for its cause. 

N. B. The word ^ac^m^ not employed: but the modes of 
operation indicated, and certain omcial persons indicated as 
operators. — Not denied* 

g. That of the interference of the Solicitor on one side^ 
viz* the Solicitor for the Crown, a selection, dhargeable ^ 
with partiality, is the habitual result. — Not denied. 
• Partly by a regard to decorum, partly by the want of that

experience which was yet to come, the sheriff was betrayed 
into two other assertions .which proved erroneous. 

6. One was — that this permanence had not among the 
number of its causes, on » the part of the learned judge 
whom he was addressing, either direction or connivance. 
This was in April 1808. But in September following we 
shall see him relating facts, by which, on the part of th6 
Judge, connivance was rendered certain, and direction (the 
system of permanence being in the Judge's answer openly 
defended) little short of it. 

7. The other was — that among the causes was either neg* 
ligence or indifference, on the part of the official persons, by 
whom the Jurors are fixed upon :.r— which persons, as the 
Lord Chiet Baron could not but know, though the sheriff 
does not state who they were, were officers acting under the 
authority of the learned Judge. — But of this breach not 
only of constitutional principle, but, as virtually admitted, o£ 
positive law, neither negligence nor indifference had been the 
cause. And the proof of its not having had either for it» 
cause is given by the sheriff himself a little further on. For, 
on receipt of a remonstrance made by him, we shall see the 
Master Packer giving up for the moment the supposed illegal 
practice^ but afterwards resuming it.. 



§ t. The Letter in its own words — with Observations. 
Here follows the letter in its own words. Phillips, p. i6ff.

128 The Letter in its own words'^^with Observations. 

•" little variation, of nearly the same individuals in every 
•• cause^for terms and years together^* 

'* In causes between individuals; this is a matter of minor 
" consequence, but in causes between the Crown and the Sub- 

* For tetm and years togHher, Here we see the notice given of the permtr 
iMNce. 

The fiict stated by the Sher^, and admitted and justified^ (as we shall see) hj 
^e Lord Chitf Baron is — not merely that in t^e special juries serving in his Lord- 
Aip's Court, there have been, out of the twelve, an indiuidual or a few itklivi- 
dusils, in whose iRstance this permanence hks had place : — ^but that it is the 
whole body of special joiymen that, for the indefinitely hmg number of years in 
qoestion, has been in this state of permanence. 

In the composition, given in each instance, to the jury taken from this per- 
inanem body of jurors, some variation, though that but a " tittU variation,*' b- 
mknuited by the sheriff': but, subject to this limitation,* the non-variation is ad- 
$nittedby the Lord Chief Baron. 

Of the di&rence between th^ several distinguishable lists, seven or thereabouti 
in number, that have place in the case of special jurors, an explanation has been 
given above. [Part I. Ch. 4. § 4.] Of the " little" variation in question, what, in 
the language of that explanation, is the result? Only that, to make allowance for 
casual non-attendance, and at the same time provide for general convenience (the 
convenience to wit of all persons who belong to any of those classes whose conve- 
nience is considered as entitled to regard}— (t. e. all persons concerned but the 
anitors) the select and secret qwd^d list is constantly larger than any actually 
ierwng list : in a word, that it contains some number above twelve : or, kst the 
arrangement should ever 6nd itself disturbed by the intervention of casual inter- 
lopers, if put upon the reduced list, say four- and- twenty. 

This select and secret qualified list is to such actually serving list what, in the 
East-India Direction the list composed of the Directors actually in the Direction 
at any given point of time, with the addition of all who ever have been in the 
Direction, is to the list composed of the actual Directors alone: with only this 
difierence, viz, that the exclusion of supernumeraries, which, in the case of the 
Bast'^ndia Direction, is determined by rotation, (subject to a prolongation of the 
exclusion in the instance of this or that individual, in so rare an event as a 
determination taken to that effiect by a majority of Proprietors) is, in the case of 
the Guinea Board, determined partly perhaps by seniority upon the list, but 
partly at any. rate, by chance, as well as partly by choice. 

Rendering the select and secret list no larger than the serving list, is an ar- 
tin^ment that stood prohibited by divers considerations. 

1. It would nave rendered the duty too severe/ it would have converted the 
hmus into a burthen — in the instance of every such member of the corps, with 
Whose business or amusements such regular and unremitted attendance would 
sot have suited : and it would thereby have excluded this or that useful member 
in whose instance the requisite obsequiousness, so often as it suited him to at- 
tend, might be depended upon. 

a. The imposition would, in this form, have been too haarefaced: — twelve per- 
lons, under the name of jur^TiieTi, sitting at all times without any variation, 
md thus forming a Board no less manifestly permanent and unchanging than 
^ai of the twelve Judges, could never have passed thus long under the name of 
^.Jury: no not even under the habitual blindness, almost universally manifestert» 
to every the most flagrant abuse, which, having Jia^ for iu authors, is screen- 
kA from scrutihy by the name of law.

ject^ your Lordship will readily conceive that it is a prac- 
•• tice viewed with jealousy^ and does not accord with those 
" other features oj our jurisprudence which are so much ad- 
*^ mired at home and abroad. 

** The evil is not attributable to the connivance or direction 
*• of the Judges^* nor to any defect in the law, but it arisef 
" solely, as I am told^Jrpm the negligence or indifference^ with 
" which the juries are struck by the proper officers, and from 
" the interference, in certain cases, of the solicitors for the 
" CroTvn.f The freeholders* list is full and tolerably perfect, 

* Connivance or direction of the Judges.} This, as already intimated, turns out 
to be a complete mis-statemen:: though, as already intimated, avery pardonable 
one. Attributable— not to the " direction" of the Judges ?•— just possible c^not 
to theif ** connivance T* — m)t possible. 

The state of things here in question is that very state of things the existence 
of which (it has so often been observed) is not only admitted but justified by the 
Chief Judge, to whom that letter is addressed. That it had his ingenuity and 
industry for its efficient cause is not certain : but that its existence was known to 
him t.v certain : since in declaring his approbation of it, he grounds that appro- 
bation on an experience of as long a siding as his own existence in the char 
racter of a public functionary. 

Of such conTztvance does the existence require confirmation? require, surely 
not: but confirmation^ if a fact so firmly established can be rendered firmer, we 
shall find it receiving further on : viz., where the permanent system having, at 
the instance of this sheriffy been for the monient broken in upon, by the most 
fully employed of the \joiA Chief Baron's two Master Packers, was restored at 
toon as the sheriff* s back was turned. 

t Negligence or indifference in the proper officers.'] Another mis-statement; but 
alike pardonuble. By the Chief Judge, to whose authority the Master Packer it 
subject, tlie system having been, according to the Judge's own declaration, con- 
templated by hich during a term of 24 years, and at the end of that term openly, 
defended, whether, on the part of this subordinate, the acting up to this system 
could have been the result of *< negligence,*' or altogether matter of << indif- 
"ference," might be left to anyone to pronounce. But, whatsoever might at the 
time of this letter, viz, 4th April 1808, have been the state of the official mind in 
question, that it was not bng before a state altogether opposite to that of uid^erence 
* had place, is demonstrated by the feet just spoken of, viz, the restoration of thi» 
ttate of things, so shortly after the day when, at the instance of the author of 
this letter, it had been suspended. 

X The Solicitor (of the Crown) is permitted to interpose,'] In relation to the in* 
etdcnt here spoken of, I suspect some want of clearness, if not of correctness, 
in the information, on which this part of the statement^ thus made by the she- 
riff, was grounded. 

1. Not only in this, but in all the other packing offices, (according to the 
practice, as stated in all the books (aj, the Solicitor, as well on this side as on the-

'* but in calling over the names, the Solicitor h permitted to

othtr, has, to one purpose, a r^^— an acknowledged rigkt^^io interpose: vn, to * 
the purpose of striking out his tweioe^ out of the 48 members cf the Gfou oc- 
casional Ust, regularly nominated by the Master Packer. 

% This interposition of his — this interposition, considered by the sherifl^ and 
by hhn denooncedto the Lord Chief Baron, as a cause of parHaUty in the se- 
lection, at whatj^c of the process is it considered as taking place? At the 
time regularly appointed for mutual deCaication, if by the exclusion of twdvt 
out of the forty-eight, any apprehension, entertained by this Solicitor of a defir 
ciency in the article of ohsequiousnessy would be satisfied, in such case all con- 
versation, whether to the effect here spoken of, or to any other, is needless or 
su p cjflu oos. 

a. That, the whole of this Gross list being at the nomination of the Master 
I^dter, wqf real danger of non-obsequiousness towards the Crown side should 
exist, except in the extraordinary case of corruption successfully applied by the 
isiMoidual, the dtfendmU, has been over and over again shewn to be a state of 
thtngB altogether improbable : that in that state of things any such danger should 
he so much as apprehended, seems not very probable. To what end tfien any 
such insert and mendacious interference? 

At what point of timef Antecedently to the declaration and production made 
of the (rf Oft occasional Ust — made, in form and ceremony, by the Master 
Packer (or his clerk) at the very time when, by the defalcation of 34, via, is on 
each side, the number on that Gross occasional list has just been brought down 
t* the 34 on the Reduced list ? or not till afler that time ? 

1. If antecedently, it would suppose, between the Master Padcer, and the So- 
ndlor of the Crown (the Solicitor of the Customs, for example, or Ae Solicitor 
of the Excise) a perfect and collusive understanding: yet, at the same time, on 
the part of the Solicitor, a fraudulent sort of language, such as would by that, 
collusion have been rendered unnecessary. And moreover, this convcrsatios 
being carried on secretly and coUusively, between these two, at a private meet» 
mg, the Solicitor cm the other side not being present, how should it transpire f 
ind not once only by accident, but, as here represented, halntuaUy transpire ? 

3. The time at which insinuations of the sort in question havt: been made, 
suppose it now to have been the very time of the regsdar and tripartite meeting, 
between the two opposite Solicitors and the Master Packer, at his office. Chi 
this occasion, if frem such insinuations any advantage could possibly be gahied 
to the C^WA side, the case must be that, after the selection constantly made of 
the 48 by the Master Packei^--all 48 being persons who cannot but have been 
put tn for the purpose of afibrdingand having an attuaUy serving list, composed 
of persons who <* with Utile variation" are in constant exercise— and therefeve 
selected for the very purpose of producing that result, which, by the admission 
s^e by the Chief BarMi, is proved to be actually and constantly proiuced^

presently appear by ^ learned gentleman who daiet fk!9m Lincoln't fam. ,

** instead of the names being inSfferently taken and dictated 

■I • , . 

theoMe, I sAy, must be, that after a selection t!ibs tnade,l}ie facolty of striking 
out twelve names — twelve names out of a list so formed — has frequently by the 
Crown Solicitor been regarded as not yet suflldent for his purpose : and on thif 
supposition, and this supposition alone> it is that, in addition to the 13 duhf 
put aside by him in the exercise of his rights tome number of other* have re« 
qnked to be wuMy put aside, by means of the Jraudulmt insinuations hers 
above supposed and mentioned. 

This being the object, how then, at the time now in question, ms. that of the 
regular meeting, is it to be accomplished^? Probability seems to be already oot 
€»f the question: as to poesibility there seems to be liut one node to mueb as 
possible, and that is this, llie list of 4B being produced by the Master 
lhu:ker to the -two Solicitors, the Crown Solicttpr takes U up and eayv-^ 
TMf man (speaking of A,) will not attend, should his name renuan upon the 
9§iuced and summoned list 9 putting him on this gross list is therefore of no uset 
east "With him then; and, to make up the 48, let us have somebody else :^-^'Thi8, 
speaking of A : and so on in regard to B, C, D, &c. whateveir may be the num* 
befof those whom, on this suppotition, it appears to him advitable to endea- 
vour in this way to get rid of. 

But while, by means of this insidious language, this fiaudulent practice it 
carrying on— the defendants solicitor-^what is /«e about all this while ? If this 
man, as you think, voill not attend^ then strike him out t or if you insist that tAc 
Vfhole number to which yotar power of striking out extends shall remain to you tm- 
Mminisfied, lei me strike hiih out.^8uch would naturally«-and, morally speak* 
f ng, necessarity^-be the language of the defendant's solicitor, unless he loo went 
in die league against his client's interests and rights. 

It is (I say) before the commencement of the operation of mutual erasuie 
that, at that tripartite meeting, any such conversation, if at all, must have been 
held:— for, afier that operation, the 48 being, by the striking out of 1:1 on eada 
side, reduced to the 24, with what colour of reason or honesty could the crown 
lolicitorTequire— and on no other pretence than that of ei^pected noivatten** 
dance — require, that A, and B, and so on, should be struck out of this reduced. 

listr 

01^ then did you leave kis rtanteinP cKclalms immediately the defendanc'c 
. tolicitor : and to what purpose strike it out now f — ^Suppose his name left in ; and 
tiierefore suppose him not to attend :--^here is the inconvenience T—^here remerim

and, if another be mow put in, I must hme the option of sinking him out, justae 
J should have had, had his name stood among the original ^8. 

On this supposition ^en, a serving list of 12, *' composed tvith fiiile variation

though constantly formed by the Master Packer, to whom every onft of ffiefr dha- 
laeter* and had>its of acting is by long experience so perfectly known, is notwith- 
standing so oddly constituted, that by striking out of the number any twelve that 
he pleases, the crown solicitor cannot yet, without increasing the discaided 
number by insidiotts practices, get such a jury as will be fit for his purpose. 
But instead of a constant good understanding between these two servants of the 
crown this would suppose a constant conflict : — on th^ part of the Master Packer, 
disposition to thwart, on every occasion, the purposes of the crown solicitor; 
which object, after all, notwithstanding the existence of a power adequtle t^

132 Chap. II. The Sheriff to the Lord Chief Baron — Notices. 

** fy the officer of the court * and the attendance of those persons 
** hemg compelled by the exaction of severe penalties, the 
•• juries are chiefly composed of those who, it is loosely 

the e^Bsct, viz. the power of choosing the whole 48, is accordisg to ftU the. evi-« 
dence in the case, never compassed on any occasion. 

Supposing therefore (which I see no reason for not doing) supposing such 
conversations to ^ave really passed as the information given to the sheriff states 
to have passed, I cannot but conclude them to have been perfectly. tnnocent: 
and that for this simple reason, that no point could be expected to be gained by 
them, were they otherwise. 

To what circumstance then attribute the mention thus madeof themby theshercff 
in this letter of his to the Lord Chief Baron .'—-evidently enough to this, viz, that 
the conception he had been led to form of the misdiief fell thus far short of its 
real magnitude : the packing, which by the information be had received bad 
been presented in the character of an irr^idar, and thence easily corrigible 
abuse, was, in truth, the result of regular and inveterate, and thence, unless by 
extraordinary measures, not corrigible, practice. 

But under charges such as these, the curious circumstance is the silence of 
the Judge. A judicial officer under your dependence is habitually in league (says 
the sheriff) with the solicitor on one side; and, being so in league with htntf 
leagued uith kimin a conspiracy against justice, permits him to set aside jurors,tUl • 
he has got a jury to his mind, — fVeil (says the Judge) says (I mean by bis silence) 
— ^Well says the Judge, and if he does, what do / care ? nor yet merely by his 
silence: for with all this before him, we shall see him pronouncing it in express 
terms, and without exception of distinction, to be '< ujell:** departure from it^ 
letter than well; meaning the opposite to weW Accordingly, in the course pf 
the letter which we shall come to presently, we shall find his Lordship speaking 
of certain results, which, being by his Lordship regarded as beneficial, recQpcilc 
him most perfectly to the means, whatsoever they may be, by which they are 
. ef&cted : yes, whatsoever they may be ; and although this collusion, ^f^^ 
tiality, and conspiracy against justice, had thus been alledged to be of iiM 
number. 

All this while the statement was, to his Lordship's knowledge,"* in many points^ 
incorrect; Why then bestow upon it this virtual admission? — Because thereof 
state of the practice was so much worse than the state thus ascribed to it. The 
assumed root ascribed to the coi;ruption was nothing worse than casual irregu* 
Jarity: nor could the cause so assigned have been adequate to the production of 
. the efifect: — ^whereas the true root was, and is to be, found in r^gtilar and esta- 
blished practice : and that practice ^o ordered as to render the corruption sure: 
the nomination completely as well as constantly and avowedly made>by an offi- 
cer in the dependence of the Judge. Observing the hound to be upon a wrong 
scent, the fox sat quiet while the enemy pursued his course. 

♦ Ind^er^y taken, and dictated by tfie officer of the court.} Consistently 
with the result, known to be produced— that result, to wit, the production of 
which is, as above, admitted, and defended by the Chief Judge, viz. the " litUe 
** vetriation" and in effect the not muck less than identity of the actually serv' 
ing list, and thence the perfect identity of the select and secre*^ list, the correct ap- 
plication 6{ any such term as indifference does not, in any sense, appear practi- 
cable. Let it even be supposed that no crown solicitor ever takes any part in the

CHAP. HI. LoRj) Chief Baron to Sheriff Sir Richard 
Phillips — Avowries and Defences. 

§ 1. Substance of the Letter. 

FOUR days after the sheriff's letter, viz. on the 9th of 
April 1808, comes, from the Lord Chief Baron to the 
sheriff, an answer, of the general complexion of A^ich an 

« 

which is to teire as a check utx>n the Judge, named on every occasion by the 
dependent of the Judge. 

• Tht enclosed letter.} vi». the letter of the learned gentleman wl^) dates from 
te Templet whose '* observations"^-ht\nis> ^ ^^ shall see, and without ex- 
ception, pronounced by the Lord Chief Baron to be *' perfectly jus^'-vc, by 
diat confirmation^ adopted, and rendered part and parcel of his Lordship's 
obtenratioiis. 



1 34 Chap. III. Ld. C^ Baron to Shinff-^Avowrits and Dtfcnces^ 

intimation has been given, as above. — Ir Admitted and jus^ 
tified, the pern\an£nce. II. Not denied.— i. that it is- 
tficonstitutioial: a. that it is contrary to Act of Parlia- 
ment : 3* that the mode, in which it is effected, is by ofii-^ 
cers in his Lordship's dependance, in collusion with the 
{Solicitor on one side. 

None of all these phasnomena coming, in his Lordship's 
conception, under the notion of " inamotrntnu^^ he ae« 
clares—^and on the authority of his own *' lor^** experience 
<f— that not " tie least inconvenience'* hag, from the practice in 
question, ever *' arisen during all that time." 

On the other band, to the restoring special juries to that 
state of independence in which they are« by the constitution, 
intended, and, in fact, supposed to be, he opposes two de- 
cided objections. These may be comprized under the fol* 
lowing heads ;t— 

1. Encrease of vexation — viz, eventual vexation to persons 
liable to be called upon to serve in the capacity of special ju* 
rors: vexation, a mischief the avoidance of which constitutes, 
it must be confessed, one of the collateral ends of justice^ 

2. Danger to justice — viz. to the main and direct ends 
qfjusti(€-> — by the prejudice that may result to one side of 
the ca^se or the other as it may happen : — to wit by a par- 
tial JosJ of a Species of ** instruction," which, in the class 
of causes in question, he represents the jurors to stand in 
peed of, to make them to do justice. 

Theoretical classifications, such as the above, are looked 
down upon of course with sublime disdain by the almighty 
creators and arbiters of practice. But being my duty, it is 
my endeavour to place his Lordship's arguments in what 
appears to me the clearest as well as strongest light of which 
they are susceptible. 

Of these supposed inconveniences ^ such is the force with 
which the consideration operates on his mi«d, that he con- 
cludes with using his influence with the sheriff to engage 
him to leave things as they are. 

Whellicr, even supposing the inconveniences in question 
to existr— and that in the utmost degree of force in which 
they are capable of existing — whether, even on that suppo* 
sition, they would in law constitute any sufficient warranty 
or so much as an apology, for the mal-practiees^ the exist- 
ence of which is admitted, is a point on which not much 
yeems to require to be said. 

^ut the yery existence of t^^e inconveniences in poiiH of

^ 2. The Letter in its own words. 

" To Sir Richard Phillips. 

''Old Bailey, Aprit gth, 1808. 

" Sir, 

*• Permit me to thank you for the very flattering manner 

' in which you were pleased to make the communication I 

* received, with respect to the summoning of special jMries. 

lUr, n I 1. 1 m's observations were perfettty just;* I cannot 



«« 



• Jifr, * s observatianstvere perfectly just} These observations are those of 

(he learned gentleman who dates from the Temple, as above : which observar 
tiotis have for their basis the opinion that the clause in question-— vie. the clause 
having for its object the securing a constant change of jurymen^— or* at any rate* 
the preventing the too frequent " returning to serve** the same juryman — '* ap- 
** plies (to use his own words) to special as well as to common jurymen." Such 
Is the opinion, with which the Lord Chief Baron declares his concurrence. 

Here then is an Act of Parliament^ which, in the opinion of the learned Judge 
himself, was nieanf to prevent a man from serving in Middlesex^ as a special 
juryman, so often ais twice in the conapass of three terms ; and this practice it is» 
Chat, understanding it to be prohibited by Act of Parliament^ the learned Judge* 
liaving all along persevericd in the countenancing of it, labours, as we shall see« 
in this letter, to preserve. 

And now comes upon the carpet a circumstance of so whimsical a com- 
plexion, that the reader had need of some time to put his mind in order for the 
reception of it. — Such is the fallibility of human learning, that notwithstand- 
ing the learned Templar's ** observations,** and the " perfect ju5/7tet«" of them« 
yet so it has happened that in the pains we shall see him take to run counter to 
the intentions of an Act of Parliament, the learned Ju(i^e was disappointed : 
the case being, that after all, on the part of the penner of that Act, there wat 
not, in truth, any such intention as that it should be construed to extend tm 
special juries. This will be shewn presently. But as to the contempt meant by 
the learned Judge to be put upon the authority of Parliament, that being an act 
•f his own, and not at all affected by the intention of any oHier persen or per- 
sons, such as the framers of that or any other act, we can do no otherwise than 
take his word for it. 

In regard xxy falsehood, a known distinction among moralists, it that between 
a logical falsehood, and an ethical one. Your logical fiedsehood is— where, for 
example, you speak of a thing which is not true as if it were true, whether you 
think it true or not : your ethical falsehood is — where you speak of a thing as 
true, heUeving it not to be true, whether it be really true or not. 

llie distinction, thus suggested, in the first instance, by the particular sort of 
obligation which regards truth, will be found applicable, with equal propriety, 
to an obligation of any other namre, together with the cwOraventions that cor- 
respond to it: and> in the present instance, it may oo this or that occasion be

*• but observe, however, that he uses the expression, • it 

of use to us, to save u$ from the imputation of incorrecmess and injustice, 
should it happen to us, in speaking of any of the laws in question, to speak of 
them— not only as contemned, but as contravened. 

In regard to the packing system, what will be clear enough to any person who 
will take the trouble of looking into the two acts in question, with this view, 
(3 Geo, 2. c. 25: 4 Geo, 2. c, 7.) i»— that the foundation of it having, not only 
at the time of passing the first of these two acts, but a considerable time be- 
fore been laid — laid and established by the practice and rules of court, which in 
each court gave the nomination of special jurors to the Master the dependent of 
the Judge — ^thc lawyer, by whom or under whose direction the several acts were 
penned, and who, it will appear probable, hiid for their principal, aqd perhaps 
for their sole, sincerely pursued object, the giving to this system an efficient de- 
gree of extent, took efiectual care not to divest vf that permanence, w'hich was 
so eigpttial to the expected service, the bodies which it had in view to organize. 

In the character pf specif Jurors as in any other, men, (they saw ii^ell enough) 
could be depended upon only in proportion as they were triedi On this princi- 
ple it was, that the contemplation of the jobs which every now and thei^ there 
might be to do, produced a natural aversion to new faces. A determination was 
accordingly taken, that when the permanence, which had been denounced to par- 
liament as the cause of the mischief, came to be prohibited, the prohibition 
sh&uld, if possible, be prevented from extending to 5pectaZ juries. 

At the same time, as in the case of jurors in general, " corruption** had been 
die abuse, which, having called the attention of the legislature to th^ subject, 
had given a preamble to the first Act, a sendment, pompounded of shame and 
apprehension, prevented them from atternpting to establish the e^pception in 
express words. The course they took was a more ingenious one. Exception, 
they inserted none; — at the same tinie they so managed the Act, that should the 
time ever come for carrying it into execution, it would, in virtue of this or tha( 
word, ingeniously slipt in for the purpose, be found, as in this very instance it 
has been found, inapplicable to special }\mes. 

Not to overload this note, a sketch of the course they took for compassiag 
'this point is posted off to a ^parate chapter. CChap. F.J 

The odd thing is that so many learried persons— two others, besides the pre- 
eminently learned one — should have concurred in a mistake, thus unfavourable, 
in appearance at least, to the state of things he was upholding at the expencff 
of so much pains. But, to find interpretation for all the wisdom displayed by 
so many learned persons, would be too much for one unlearned one. Sufficient 
be it for him simply to point it out as forming the matter of a probleip, which 
must be left to take its chancp for solution from some other liand. 

What makes the oddity still more odd is— that of these same statutes the non- 
applicability to the subject of special juries (those clauses of course excepted in 
which special juries are expressly mentioned) had been declared more than 
once, after solemn argument, by the Court of Kin^*s Bench Once in a compa- 
ratively recent case, that took place^in Michaelmas Term, on the 25th of No- 
vember 179s: — about three quarters of a year after the day,^hich gave the be- 
nefit of the Lord Chief Baron's wisdom to the Exchequer Bench, Once before 
thai time, in a comparatively antient case, determined by Lord Chief Justice 
Raymond, in the case of the King against Franklin, Hilary Term, 5 Ceo. 2. 
anno 1731 ; about a twelvemonth after the passing of the first and most'efl5- 
Cient of this string of Acts:— a case the Report of which was, on the occasion, 
and for the purpose, of the cause last decided but here first mentioned, dug up 
\iy one of the Judges cBuUer) out of the heap of dust^ in which for two-and'*

*• you think k worth your while' to make any reform :* this, 
•* a» far as' respects the Court of Exchequer, I have not 
•• found from the experience of above twenty-four years, in 

waxj yean it had lain bnried: baried as usual, kst the knowledge of it should 
become possible to those who were to be made to sufier for not knowing of it 

If indeed so it be, that on this occasion it had become an obt^ect with his 
Lordship, to shew to the people of London and Middlesex, through the medium 
of their sheriff, what sort of regard English Judges are in use, and upon occa- 
sion disposed, to pay to Acts of Parliament, on this hypothesis the particular 
turn, thus taken by his Lordship's wisdom, may be accounted for, fay bd^ 
brought within a general rule. 

When an Act of Parliament is produced to an English Ju4ge, and the execu- 
tion of it called for at bis hands, the first questio^with him naturally is-rtflA^ 
iher it miU his taste: if yes, be gives it his^fiatot what he calls ** fass^fpori:** 
if no, he deals by it as the pre-eminently teamed person, here in quesdon, dealt, 
and may be seen dealing by this law, ^ relevancy of which, if not actually 
believed by him, was at least feigned to be believed fot Uie purpose of shewing 
his regard for it. 

Thus in the instance of Lofd Chief Justice Raymond, in the case dug up, as 
above, by Mr. Justiee BuQer^-speaking of the Act, then as well as now, in 
question— (9i%. 8 Geo. 3. c. 2S.) '* ^«" (vn. Lord Raymond) ** said— <^ acf o^ 
"parliament was a very beneficial, jlct, and ought to be supported." Note, that 
being in the secret, he knew that this Act, benefidal as it was, was not on any 
occasion on which corruption could have been checked by it, ever intended, 
otherwise than in show, to extend to special juries: and consequently, that it 
would not stand in the way of any of that corruption, for die purposes of which 
the special jury system "had been instituted, and in and by this very Aet, was by 
die asiutia of the learned penmen spread out to an all-comprehensive extent 

He therefore who should take upon him to impure to English Judges, or to 
any of them, any such intention as that of overthrowing all acts of partntaent 
without distinction, would utter a gross calumny : as gross a one as if he were 
to impute to Lord Elleoboroogh any isuch intention as that of suppressing all 
publications without distinction.— No : where, as in the instance of Lord Ray- 
mond, an act of parliajnpnt has the good fortune to be agreeable to their t^le, 
and the parliament by which it has just been enacted is still sitting, in any such 
state of things, such is their cx>ndescension, they are ready to give it their 
** support." 

In regard to the question whether, as pef hypodiesis, in thus setting up an 
act of parliament his Lordship's object was to shew how easily he could put it 
down, some additional light may perhaps be thrown upon it, by a case which 
tl\erc will be occasion, a little further on, to bring to view r (S>ee Part IK Chap, uj 
a case in which, if the evidence be to be believed, we shall see die Judges, all 
twelve of them, concurring in the declared determination to persevere in defeat- 
ing the express words as well as unmisconceivable intention, of a law) made for 
the sole purpose of putting an end to certain oppressions and extortions, the pro- 
fit of which had thus been vainly endeavoured to be snatched out of their 
bands. 

* ** If you think it worth whiU* to make any reform,'} Of the letter thus alluded 
to the words arc " If you should think it worth while to rectify the practice 
M which W obuined",... Here we see— alas!— a jeqfkil: a jeofail in the 
shape of a nUsrecitol: an trror large enough, had it been properly placed to hayp

of this presently. 

The light in which, the two learned lawyeis—tfae official and the pnfitsimal 
one — the light, with its different shades, in which the Bupposcd contraventkMt 
it coosidered bjr them, is wdl worth observation : the rather, as it afibrdb a for- 
ther specimen of the sort iiljlnnsideration which the law of parliament it ac 
custtMMd to be beki in by the fraternity of lawycn. By the professional tawycr, 
the dhaoge proptaed by the sheriff is admitted to be a <' rectificatiim:** a subst^' 
tvtion of right to wrong : a substimtion of obedience to an inveterate oouiseoC 
wiUul and conteonptuous disobedience. But, to rooted in the minds of tbt 
brotherhood is the habit of treating with contempt the only rule of action 
which is not, unckr the usurped name of low, a system of imposture, that let 
ibe disobeMenee it haa been treated with be ever so flagrant and undeniable, % 
4aid4 is expressed, whether it be *' worth wkik** to substitute to it the contrary 
habit of oledieace. 

Sokimuch for the learned Cotauel:^9B to the pfe-«minently learned Jit^e, 
whta he comes to take up the matta, thus frur we see him concurring with ibc 
kamed Counsel at the first glance ; vw. that it rests with them and theirs, wfae- 
tlMr.topayanyregaidtoanactof iNuliamentornoc: and, finding, in the doubt 
of the. learned. Counsel, a sort of sanction, i.er what among lawyers passes as 
such, foc.the fractice---for that practice, which, without doubt on either part» 
Ibe legislature bad, after stigmatizing it as " corrupt" (see Pari I. Ch, 4. ( ^J 
probibited, he lays hold of the doubt, as a sort of authority, entitled to have its 
weight, where the authority of parliament b4d none. 

In the opinion thus given by the learned Counsel one litde expression, how* 
ever, did not' altogether quadrate with the views of the learned Judge: I mean 
the word " rect^ :** because, in the idea of rectification, a word so far from 
being suitable to bis purpose, b oeoessariiy included the actual existence 
of something wrong, on an oc c asion where the thing signified by it was to 
be discountenanced. His Lordship puts aside accordingly this unguarded word^ 
which does not suit his purpose, and substitutes another which does suit bis pur- 
pose. This other is the word " rrform:" a word which to lawyers in general, in 
ooQcunence with all others, who have an interest in the maintenance of abuse 
in any, shape, is an object of such well-known' horror : having for its synonimet 
theory, speculation, innovation, infidelity, jacobi(tism, confusion,^ destrucUtn 
^f social order, et castera, and so forth. 

Judge and Barrister together, it is curious eoough to observe what, in the 
judgment of those learned persons, is, as well as what is not, *' worth While.* 
What is worth while, is-^violating a fundamental principle of the constitution : 
what is not worth while, is — ceasing to violate it. VjThat is worth while is— 
freaking the law : what is not worth while, is-^obeying it. What is worth while, 
\te~/ormi7ig this judicaiory corps oi gentlemen pensioners: what is not worth 
frhlle, 'i^—disbanding it.

more plentiful near to London than at a ifi^fance .* a. For a guinea, with the chance, 
and that not a bad oiie, of earning several more guineas than one, not to speafc 
of a good dinner, many a mem would be content to come a mile or tw6, who 
would not be content to come *' fifteen** miles \ — the distance qxikcn of by hia 
Lordship immediately after, as having been a subject of complaint. A mite or 
twaa gentleman may come on foot: fifteen miles, unless it be f6r m waner, be 
will scaree ever come, otherwise than with horse or carriage. 

Necessary ? No : unless so it be— that, it being ybimd or deemtd nteetfary, or at 
Itast agretable and convenient, to have regani to the convenience of the indivi-

what necessity there is presses all of it upon his shouMers ; and consisu in ne-

servient, by more circumstances Aan one. 

1. It keeps out talesmen, plebeian substitutes, who, being taken at random^ 
could not in point of discipline be to be depended upon, and among whom in a 
oause of real interest, such as a libH cause, any one bad player might, under 
the system of farced unanimity, by possibility be sufficient to spoil the whole

" ing brought fifteen miles from their homes^* whereas the

whom this obligatioii Ucs, lU of them in affloem circumttances, afflaence in 
every, instance the declared (round of their selection, 15 miles the longest jour* 
ney which any one of them has to take — under these circomstances, out of four- 
tnd-twenty to whom on the occasion of each cause the commands of justice 
tie signified, can twelve be too great for the number of those on whose part 
obedience to those commands can with probability be expected? Of such wmr 
€PspectatioM, or rather such despair, what can be the ground? In other coimties» 
the journey may be from twice to thrice as long — the persons to take it may be 
such as are not in possession of a Jijlht a tenthi^ a Jlftieth, a hundredth part the 
opulence : yet in that state of things what complauit is ever heard of a want of 
jurors?— Mark well the consistency : — men who can he$i afibrd it, and would be 
well paid for it, and who would not have to come so great a i<t5^«n«e, cannot be 
especttd to come, even in so much smaller manbers,: — v^ile.men who can ill af- 
ford it, and are not paid for it, come from a greater distance^ and in greatet 
numbers. 

Aye but these an but Common Jurers: — men ** who hauenothu^todotoUh the 
'* kao^* fas has been well .sai^ *' but to obey them:*'r^and who are accordmgly 
hepl as much as possible from knowing the /ati», for fear they should obey them. 
But the others (you seem to forgeij are Special Jurors : and do you consider who 
special jurors are? — Why, Sir, they are all gen^/emcn;— gentlemen^ every man 
of them ! and when you consider this, you cannot surely be so extnivagant-r: 
can youf-— as to expect, that they shall be forced to attend, whether it be convey 
nient to them or no, just as if they were so many petty fiumers, petQr handi- 
crafts, or petty shopkeepers ? 

Here then on this occasion, as on every other occasion, vre come sooner or 
later, to the radical and all-pervading grievance. One law for gentlemen, an- 
other for low people :— comforts and attentions heaped together on one si<^ j— 
burthens and neglects on the other ) — such throughout is the spirit of that spuri- 
ous kind of Uw which has the Judges for its authors : such is the " respect qf 
*^ persons" which, in the bosom of English Judges, occupies the place of jus- 
tice!*^ And, so rooted is this partiality, that we see it thus openly avowed, just 
as if it were a duty ; in which character it seems actually to have passed itself 
upon the religion of this our learned Judge. 

Now, as to the gentlemen m question, to what title is it that they are indebted 
for the fiivour thus habitually shewn to them by this our learned Judg^, the 
representative and mouthpiece, as on this occasion he may well be taken to be, 
of the learned and reverend brotherhood, of which he is so distinguished a mem- 
ber? Is it to any particular connection, in the way of interest, alliance, friend- 
ship, or acquaintance, with those learned and reverend persons, any of them» 
or any of their connections? this is partiality upon a small scale. Is it purely to 
that of their belonging tothedass of gentlerrtenf this is partiality upon the 
laieest scale. 

* CompUants, ...of having been brwghtjifleen miles^ Of the comparative 
amount of this hardship, something has been said already, (Part /. Chap. 4. 
§ b.J and something more may perhaps be to be said anon. At present, what 
seems (0 call for notice, is — the service rendered to the packing system by the 
ion of oppression thus complained of, taking into the account the complaints 
that were the fruit of it. ^

Mb f^ish ft plea in Ceivoar of it, might tbas be rendered subservient to its main- 
tenance and defence. On this or that occasion, on which the verdict was, to 
the powers above, a matter of indifference, this or that gentleman was sum- 
moned, of whom it was known that by his situation, geographical, domestie,, 
or political, he was rendered unfit for service in the Guinea corps. He came ac- 
cofdingly, served and grumbled : and thus, out of the grumblings of this mtie* 
COT malgre hd of the body politic, was made an argument, for composing the 
establishment of willing ones. 

Not having the honour to be in the secret, it is oioly from appearances that I 
can speak :— from appearances — and there they are. 

* Instructing Jury after Jury. . . . exposes loth parties, &c,} Sjrroptoms of 
somnolency begin to discover themselves: and, on the part of the jurors or 
Others, to whom the instruction is to be applied, if of this sort be the form in 
which it is to be administered, some danger there seems to be, lest the somno- 
lency should be found contagious, and *' the jmints" do as well as they can, 
without being " undersUxnt* at alL 

B«t, this being one of the two grand arguments, of which, on the ground of 
r^oon and utility, the pillars of the padcing system are composed, an attempt 
will be made presently to get to the bottom of it, and extract whatsoever t»- 
siruction may be capable of being extracted from it. 

Meantime may not this be among the '* points** that ihight be found lying 
there (I mean. at the bottom of the argument) or thereabouts? — vist. that the 
instraction of a Jury is work for the Judge ; and, in particular, that sort of 
work, which sometimes calls for learned thotijghtf *and always occupies learned 
timef y 

If so, the reason, it must be confessed, is by no means a purely personal, be* 
ing in no small degree a public, one. For, besides those operations of a nature 
purely meckaoical, which, in the Equity system more especially, haive beea 
so contrived as to oppose a constant and unbending bar to the charge of frecipi~ 
tation — in regard to the work of decision in particular, which can never be re- 
duced to the simplicity of pure mechanism, (See Scotch Reform^ Letter ft. jQe- 
tficesj in such manner as to convert into absolute superfluity eveiy application 
of human reason — in regard to this special kind of work, some how or other so 
it has happened, that, in that honourable Court, the rate of progress ha^, fot 
some years back, been such as to have been regarded with more complacency 
on the drfendants than on the plaintiff *s side. Speak of the Exchequer, ayejiut 
look to the Chancery: speak of the Chancery, aye but look to the Exchequer: 
speak of English Equity, aye but look to /re/ami-— such is the sort of comfort 
which plaintiff have been in use to administer to one another: yea, 9nd con- 
tinue to administer to one another to this day, unless in Ireland any thing has 
b)q>pened within this year or two, to break in upon the regularity of the conso- 
latory circle.

" tures, and the laws on the subject, exposes both parties to 
•• the hazard of the points being ill understood, and hastily 
•* determined by them. 

" During the long time that I have been employed in the 
•* Court of *^ Exchequer, I have known y^a; verdicts from 
•* which I should have dissented * had I been one of their in- 
•• estimable body, and they have been cases wherein the de-

of justice if, in that her highest temple, adtpted— >if not to the simplicitj anil 
felicity of the gol^n age, at any late to the longerity of antedtlnvitfki tifnes. 

He that has to speak of these things, let him look well to hb words: let him 
•peak in parables, borrowing a ray of obscurity from the speeches which ir« hit 
tfieme. It is at this price only that he can hope to foil the official Oedipust ih* 
fubpeena'd interpreter of informational mnutndoes. But let not men com}dain s 
for it is for the use of such FaMu^s in the character cH fee-tutars (called by the 
' Greda ^an^o^ayoi) that in the character of plaint^s and dcfimdants men were 
made. 

* Few verditts fromwhich I should have dissented, had 1 been ctu, &c.] Perdki 
and dissent f dissent, and, on the part of a supp<»ed juryman, from a verdict 9 
Strange and never before associated ideas ! Alas ! were these waking or rieeping 
thoughts ? In what region of romance were the thoughts of his Lordship waiH 
dering, when in idea he heard a verdiet pronounced by a jury, and hjioself a 
dissenting member of it ? By what process were two phaenom^na, which in real 
life are so incompatible, brought together by his learned fiuicy? Speaking with 
respect — but, forasmuch as all this is but supposition , speaking otf^-^was it that 
' Ills Lordship was pleaded to perjure hvntselff joining in one of those <' perjuries" 
Which Judge Blackstone has' found so well associated with <^ piety," and which 
the humanity of so many of his reverend l^rethren have so frequently, so 
Ihmkly, and so successfully manifested? was it then that thus in visioa his wa« 
pleased to puijure himself, declaring assent by his lips, while dissent was. in hit 
breast? or was it that, at the end of a certain number of days and nights of 
inanition, having fainted under the torture, he had thus by silence given up- 
pertumty to that verdict, to which his assent, expressed either bpi^rds or ao«> 
tk>n, could not by any agonies have been extorted? 

Or was it, that instead of fancying himself in the jury-box, he vm for th« 
moment nodding, as if with his old friend ** good Homer," and occupying**-^ 
not as now upon the woolsack, but on some other sedt, more elevated, and noc 
for distant, a place in the House of Lords f — forasmuch as in that august asscm<v 
bly, dissents, however rare, are neither unexampled, nor (since there happily 
they may be avowed without perjury) unavowed. 

On the principle of the apology, made by a Dr. 0*Meara of the day, for pro^ 
;nouQcing before a polite congregation, so unpolite a word as hell, may not aif. 
tpdogy here be due, for a word so near of kin to it as perjury f — an apology ?—» 
yes, by all means: — considering that in so many a reverend company, the kss 
odious the tMmg, the more odious the name. 

^ Paomiratle to the defendants,'] Taking for granted, which I do sincerely and 
widiout difficulty, that the cases alluded to by his Lordship under the description 
of eases in which he " should have dissented from the t?«rdtct"— it being as above 
** favourable to the defendant" — ^were cases in which it was unjustly fovoarabk^ 
eormptixfn by iadtvidael« has already been stated^ in another place, (PtrtL 



§ t. The Letter in its own words^ ' ■ 143 

" Having hitherto seen* no reason to complain, as far as 
•• my experience goes, it must be left to your own discre- 

Chap, 4.) as an operation in wiiich ^he efiect in question may, with no slight ' 
appearance of probability, ha^e had its cause. 

fFhat f — is this then your hypothesis f — is this the persuasion you are seeking to 
Mread-'^vvL that in the 84 ^cial jury causes tried in a year m the Court <(f 
Exchequer, {PkUUps, p. 1590 ^^6 is not one^ in which the verdict has not 
been a corrupt one ? corrupt on one side or other— either on the plaintiff*! or oo 
the defendant's aide ^ 

■ My answer is — that, an trudi, among a given number of yerdicts, I should 
•ot expect to find more wrong ones in the Court of Exchequer, than in any othef 
Court taken at random.. I couM even add reasons — were there in this place any 
vae. in it, reasons, why I should not expect to find even so many ; I could go 
ftmher stiJiif and add reasons why, in that jttdicatcry, I should evpect to find 
die number of wrong verdicts, as well as the degree of aberration in «aac9 
admitting of degree, rather diminished by the efiect of the inflnenec exerciaed 
•n the Guinea corps than encreased. But, without having any other ground 
#ian as above* what I should not be at all surprized at, is — to find that now and 
then the fiivour shewn to individuals in the character of defendants had had 
emrrupHon in some shape or other, for its cause. At any rate, supposing cor- 
mption on this side never yet produced, yet if it be possible fsr corniptioa in 
juries to be produced, produced in any other way than by open allowance of it 
by law, I can think of no other by which so high a probability of oorniptioit 
could be produced, as by the permanency thus secured. 

As to other Courts, L have suted already, (Part I. Chap. 0.) that the Court 
particularly in question here — vtz. the Court of Exchequer — is not a judicatory, 
in which, notwithstanding my abhorrence of this system of corruption, I 
•hould .expect to find wmg vtfdicta the result of it : and that— exeepc such 
caittal partialities, to the harbouring of which all judicatories are more or lest 
■cspoaed — it is only in the King's Bench, and even in the King's Bench, in such 
cases alone as are, in some way or other, connected with what is called /^oit^icf, 
and particularly in UAd law cases, that I should expect to- find wrong verdicts 
ffodoced by such a cause. ' 

Aa to the Court of Exchequer, in that indicatory, I know of no worse naa 
other bad efiects as produced by the packing system, than, on the part of 
Judges, a confirmation of the habit of open contempt as towards the authority 
of the legislature, the equally open violation of an unifersally acknowledged 
principle of the constitution, and the uneasiness, and by no means groundlcw 
alarm, produced in the brrasts of the people, by the apprehension of injoUlo^ 
though in cases in which I myself should not expect u> find it taking pUoe. 

Now these are, in my conception, all of them, very serious evils. Hmag t 
ttiousand pound justly due ta me, suppose I were to give to a juryman a hvn- 
drcd pound, or the promise of a provision for some friend or dependent of bisy 
to secure my thousand pound to me by a favourable verdict: and the verdict, 
with a thousand pound damages, is found for me in consequence, riere, by 
the supposition, the verdict itself is not a wrong one : but, supposing the trans- 
action between me and the juryman to transpire, would not the evil be a very 
serious one? Would not the feeling of insecurity under the law be much more 
intense and extensive than it is even at present?

venicnces, the pressure of whicli on his Lordsihlp'ii mind 
becaitie so irresistible, as t6 force him at once upon twd 
measures of such extr^ttiity as the violating an ^ckhow-^ 
ledged ' fundamental principle of the constitution, and tral 
veiling on for years in a course of persevering and opened- 
eyed disobediente, in the teeth of the authority of the 
legislature. 

Not that, had the advantages professed to be <;xpected 
from this transgression been ever so niany; times as gr€9t ai 
even by himself they could have been isupposed to be» they 
could ever have amounted to so much as the Shadow of ^ 
defence. On every imaginable supposition, th6 dp^ratidii 
thus performed by the subordinate, by the ja^cia/ authority; 
is inaefensible. The ehaiige thus effected, would it, if pro- 
posed to parliament, have been approved and cart-ied intd 
effect by parliament ?-— attempting it by judicial authority 
vfZ!& needless: — would it have been disapproved? — attclmpt-- 
ing it by judicial authority was not fitting. 

Instead of that of George the Third, had the reign been 
such an one as that of Elizabeth, in which the intention of 
sparing the subject as much as possible — perhaps for ever—* 
ihe trouble of paying their homage at the foot of the par- 
liamentary throne was declared — declared, from the throne 
itself, and merit grounded on it — ^at such a period—- such 
usurpation might in such supposed advantages have found 
an excuse.. But now — in the igtli century — when the re* 
turn of the sessions is become no less regular than that of 
the seasons ?-:— is this a time when the plea of necessity can 
form so much as a veil-— any even the slighest Veil-^fbr any 
such usurpation ? . 

Yet though the work be but supererogation^^and the! 
words bestowed upon it little better than surplusage— ^let us 
take up the arguments one after another, and look a littltf 
into their texture. Let us see whethtK when put together^

finger of detection might bsLve been' laid upon it :— mean« 
time, in default of stronger handles, let us look out for 
something that for the moment may be taken hold of, 
though it be but of straw or cobweb. 

But before we proceed to observe upon it, let us, by way 
of necessary preliminary,, b^n witn the endeavour to iVi- 
terpret it, or, as they say in Westminster-school, and ia 
Westminster-hall, to construe it — or, in plain English, to 
find out the meaning ^it, or, when the worst comes to the 
worst, a meaning for it. 

" Instructing jury after jury . . . . exposes** (says his Lord- 
ship) '* parties to a hazard.** • • • . Not that from this we^ 
ought to conclude that, taken in the abstract, ^'iij/rtir/t^ii is 
a bad thing : — ^bad, either for those to whom it is nat^ or 
even to those to whom it t>, communicated* 

No, nor yet that, in taking for the subject of instruction 
'* many speaes of mantifactures" ^ there is more of hazard 
than there would be in confining the instntdion to some of" 
them, and leaving the rest to go without it • • • But • • • 

But — lest to construction, carried on upon this plan, there 
should peradventure be no end, let us lay aside construe- 
tion, and take up paraphrasis^ or, as we say in English, 
paratkrase^ instead of it. 

Many are the species of manufactures, in the instance of 
each of which, in respect of this or that part^ of the whole 
"Assemblage of instruments and operations, which, on the oc-« 
casion of a revenue caose in the £xchec[uer, is liable to 
come in question, the demand for instruction and explana-^ 
tion is so considerable, that the utmost quantity of instruc- 
tion that will» generally speaking, have been afforded on 
the occasion, and brought within the compass, of a single 
cause, will not have been sufficient to satisfy it : so that, 
should the same part of the process be brought a second 
time under the notice and cognizance of one and the same 
juryman, the probability is that, with the help of the addr-- 
tional instruction which on this second occasion he will re- 
ceive, the conception which he will have obtained of the 
matter at this second trial, will he more accurate and com^ 
plete, than the conception he obtained at the first trial, 
whereby in so far as depends upon him, the chance in fa« 
vour of a right verdict will receive a proportionable in<% 
erease. 



$ ^ Mischievous Dactrines involv^ in this Drfence. 1 49 

§ 4. Mischievous Jioctrirus involved in this D^cnce. 

Meantime if this, or any thing like it, be the argument 
of this pre-eminently learned Judge, let us observe now 
where it leads, — ^We shall find involved in it the following 
doctrines : — 

• 1. That, ki respect of causes of the particular descrip- , 
tion in question, jury trial, in the ordinary mode« is not a 
fit mode of trial : at any rate, not so fit as the new mode 
which he has contrived to substitute to it. 

2. That, for these causes, the more proper, if not the 
only proper species of judicatory is that which is composed 
of a Board or Bench (call it w)iich you please) of perm?^^ 
nent Judges : for example, such as the Board of Excise, 
which already to a considerable extent has jurisdiction in 
these same matters: the principal difference being that in 
this Special Jury Board there is an over number of Judges to 
make a kind of rotation: which species of judicatory, pre* 
serving to it still the name of Judge and Jury, with the 
forms of jury trial, he has substituted accordingly. 

3. That, the mode employed bv him being such, as ren- 
ders this secretly formed nozra of completely dependent 
Judges, under the disguise of jurymen, applicable with 
equal facility, and in practice, as there is reason to thinks 
jfSuprd Part L Ch. VllL) actually applied, at the pleasure 
of the dependent servants of the crown, to crown causes \n 
general, (capital^ and next to capital, excepted) aiid, in 
particular, to crown libel law causes, the superiority of ad* 
vantage^ attached to this sham jury trial, as compared wixh ^ 
the genuine mode, is such, as warrants the departure made 
to so great an extent from the acknowledged principles of 
the English constitution. 

4. That this superiority is even such, as not only would 
warrant the U^slature in making the change, but actually 
has afforded to a Judge ^ viz. to himself ^ a sufficient warrant 
for making it of his own authority^ and without warrant from 
the legislature. 

$ 5. Acknowledged nothingness of the Advantage^

of it ; and in this view at the cost pf some days of lar 
bour I had actually pursued to no inconsiderable length 
the analysis of it. But upon turning once more to bis owa

MiiANtiMJC, in dembhstration of this tlothingness, oni^ 
argument (it being a short Que, and not involving any in. 
^uiries of detai}) snail not be consigned to oblivion witn the 
rest. 

On the part, and in the person of, and froili the '* iVt- 
^* sMietion ' that would be afforded by, this our pre-eihi- 
nently learned Judge^ a jury of the old school, were it 
pienhittcd to ** s&ve^" would have fhe benefit, not merely 
of •• sofMt ekperieAceC* but of cpnsiimniate experience. Now 
tKen« after the berlefit of such instruction, though received 
in the ecxirse of no more than one single cause, to wit the 
eause for the trial of which such jury had been summoned; 
and was sitting, what would be the utxnbst advantage deriva* 
We to any practical purpose, from any other, to wit any 
antecedent, lecture or tourse of instruction, that could even 
from the same pre-eminently learned lecturei*, have beein 
received ? — Nothing ; no, nothing at all ; is the answer I re^ 
turn with the utmost confidence. Whlre ^* the points'* were 
such, as to be either plain enough in themselves, or made 
«o by the one only lecture whichi till this our pre-eminently 
learned lecturer set up, was ever designed by the cdnstitii- 
tion for an English jury, his Lordship would accordingly 
leave the decision to the opinion of these plain meti. When 
these same '•koi«/j** had any such intricacy in them, as en- 
titled tliese plain men to the benefit of an opinion, formed 
iand ready made for them by this at present consummately 
experienced, and fro^i the first most incontestably compe- 
tent, Judj^e, he would not refuse it to them. This incon- 
testably competent opinion, would it find them disposed id ac^*

and ("if^ the BIackstone'4 phrase) " euery thing would be a^ 
V ii shoul4 he.** Would it find them disposed to r^ractorir 
ness? it is not by apy antecedent experience that they could 
haye been cured of so troublesome a vice* 

But (say^ some one with the proper expressions oi jtr 
gret) the country (alas!) cannot always enjoy the ble$sipg ii 
possesses at pre^ei^t, in the services of this our veteran and 
fcon^umm^ly experi^ncjsd Judge : that blessing withdrawn, 
comes some other Lord Chief Barpn, who, though ]the ade- 
quacy of his general leffal learning will be sufficiently 
proved by his situation, will not, with reference to causes 
of the class in question, be, at the commencement .of his 
first cause, altogether so completely endowed in the article 
of experience. Here then, upon his Lordship's improved 
plan, comes the benefit of an experienced, and thence of 9, 
permanent jury :7-rwhile the Judge is learning to walk, the 
jury will be able to go alone. But, upon the old plan, 
what experience would there be ? — ^Wben the blind have 
no leader but the blind, the consequence is such as need not 
be mentioned. 

I answer-— were the argument, which has been shewn to 
|be worth nothing, worth ever so much, it could not to this 
purpose be of any use. At a much cheaper rate ths^i 
the violating of a vital principle of the constitution, an 
adequate allotment of appropriate experience might, at all 
times, ^e seated upon thd Bench. Set a thief to cqjtch g, thi^ 
is a coarse proverb, but, on the present occasion, not an 
uninstructive one. In that division of the Court of £xcl^* 
quer, (not to speak of the great ^w-officers, who might not 
always regard a Presidentship, which has so recently cried 
date obolum, worth the honour ot their acceptance) ther^ 
. will be always some one learned gentleman at least, by 
whom, in the character of licenced accessary after the fact^^ 
or in two words standing Counsel, to the fraternity of sn^ug- 
glers, an ample stock of ^^^rt«ic^— appropriate experience 
• — cannot but have been laid in. 

But (replies the learned gentleman on the o(|i|Nr side) any 
rule to this effect would be an infringement upon the li» 
berty of the prerogative : that liberty being proportion ably 
trenched upon by every rule, the tendency of which is to 
secure the appointment of fitter functionaries in preference 
to less fit ones. It would accordingly be injured, if, in.his

(choiee bi Judges, it were rendered more difficult to hit 
Majesty tlian it has been, to provide for the accommodation 
of the family connections of persons in *' high situations.** 
Prerogative (I answer) is an argument, which is (I mutt

tionl ^ut, in the Westminster-hall Benches, besides tern 
subordinate seats there zx^ four chief or principal onetj: 
and the prerogative, it is humbly subqpiitted, would not tut* 
tain much injury, if, for the superior purpose of private ac» 
commodation, it were to apply itself to some one of the 
many other seats in which no such imperiout demand for 
experience — appropriate cktndtO'VMcharwiO^coffmercial expe- 
rience — as that, of which by the unprecedeated sagacity cf 
the present Lord Chiisf B^ron, the discovery has so recently 
Jbeen made» 



. \ 7. Mscbievousness of the Doctrine further developed. . 

But the material thing is that, if his Lordship's senti- 
ments have not been strangely misinterpreted by hit words, 
it is not merely in Exchequer causes, viz^ Exchequer reve-^ 
nue causes, that, in his conception of the matter, the tub« 
j^itution of a per^nanent and dependent Board, under the 
name of a jury, to the jury of the old school, ought .to be 
applied ; but in all causes to which that antiquated species of 
jury has ever been applied : in all such causes without exr* 
ception, but more particularly in liiel causes. JFor, such it 
the nature of the reason thus held up;by biqi rto viflwu that 
to the application of it any narrower extent cannot iurelv be 
assigned. This reason consists of the^^iranmccuivier wnich 
each member of* a jury cannot but be supposed, to labour, 
the first time, at least, of his serving in that character : of 
which ignorance, in his Lordship's view of the matter, the 
influence— the morbid and debilitative influence — -is such» 
that nothing less than permanence can afford an adequate 
cure for it. 

The ** points" which he speaks of as being the subjects of 
this ignorance — of this ignorance to which there exists no 
r^emedy but in that '* experience" which supposes perma^ 
nence— the actually existmg and thus defended permanence 
— are, not only points relating to the conduct of manufac* 
fures, ** many species of manufactures" but points relating

hention, ana consequently of demand for instfuctioDy for 
wptfunct in r^cmii^ infttruetion, and consequently again 
foF peiinaiience of situation, Ihe utmost demand created by 
those OBrticular laws, which ha?e for their subject '* A€

«if eVery fan of the f ule of action, which has any speeies

^aseisf the gitai bod^ef the law, remaining ak it does in 
the shape, or rather m the shapeless state^ of commm^^ a&di 
unwritten, law, there exist no such determinate set of words. 
Jn all this vast extent, the two sources of difficulty, and 
with it of demand iot ' ^^ experience'' and permanence^-^/z. 
law and manufacture — are combined in one. Judges, the 
•master iftfvit^/firfvri : law, or^ what to every purp o se of 
^ujfitfing at least, if not of instruction or reAg^,— has the 
firc6 Of law, law itself the drod^ci of the manufacture. 

In the case of every owr species of manufacture—- <>f 
tilery species of manufacture commonly known by that 
tikm4, 'toe master manutaciurer viewing, in every miscoii- 
ieeptioM that ma,y take place, a source of loss to himself, at|d 
-iNtving to deal with simple and uncultivated minds in the 
eb^rvetef 'o( labourers, has for one of his objects, and that 
^ttnMmt otie, •the ve^dering the conception, of the o^a*

Whatsoever may have been the course of endeavour-^ 
whether mtk or against the stream of interest — the result isf, 
at any rate, equally and indisputably notoridbs. The de- 
tnand for instruction, and consequently for *^ experience** 
and consequently for permanence, being then so much greater 
in the cases in which his Lordship was not led to bring it to 
^iew, tbani in the cases in which he was led to bring it to

Sileh in conclusion are the questions and obsierviitiotti 
that might be addressed to the pre-eminently learned author 
^ tbi* defence, and, as it should seem, not altog^her wit!^ 
out ftoine prespecl'of effect, if the forms of the constku^ 
tioii were any thing better than a cloak for de^spotiism, and 
if responsibility were, in fact, among the attributiss of 4ill 
£nglish Judge.

Now, suppose again for argument sake, it had pleased 
this pre-eminently learned Judge to •* think it zoorth wMle^ 
to allow, to King, Lords, and Commons, respectively, theit 
H^veral Votes in relation to this business; more particular^ 
to the Cotnmons, whose attention is, or used to be, consN 
dered as, in a more particular degree, bespoken for regula* 
tions affecting the revenue. 

* In the House of Commons, besides the Committees of 
4he whole House, there would probably have been appointed 
some select Committee for the purpose. Thus appointed^ 
the Committee would have set itself to woi^k, arid b^gun 
with analyzing the general conception thus formed by the 
ingenuity of the learned Judge: — decomposing it, they 
would have resolved it into such particulars at may be found. 



1^6 Chap, IV. ObservaUons en the Lord Chief Baron* s Defences^ 

involved in it : — ^particufars, the number of which is deter* 
mined by that of the several *' manufactures,* the practice 
of. which has, under favour of that permanence whichvforms 
so really u^fpl an attribute of the judicial seats, been 
brought under the dominion of his Lordship's science. The 
analysis thus performed, they would, in the instance of ea^h 
Biich nianufactur^, have proceeded to enquire into the truth 
and accuracy of that general conception, and into the de- 

free of force, with which, in each instance, the argument 
educed from it,, in defence of a select and permanent 
Board, in preference to a fortuitously determined and ever 
changing jury, maybe found applicable. « 

Supposing that in each one, or in this or that part of the 
whole number of these manufactures, the quantity of in,- 
struction necessary to the giving the requisite assurance of a 
Tight verdict, had respectively appeared so great, that the 
quantitjd of time, capable of being allotted to om trial by 
, jury, could not with propriety be considered as sufficient 
for imbibing it, then, and not till then, would it remain for 
the consideration of the Committee, whether, for the obtain- 
ment of whatsoever increased probability of correct judica* 
tare appeared capable of being obtained by the proposed 
substitution, it would really be worth while that an inno- 
vation applying to so important a part of the constitution 
should be introduced. 

Supposing this question determined in the affirmative* 
then wjuld come upon the carpet, for the consideration of 
the Committee, the question concerning the organization of 
the permanent ^^ar^ or tench oi Judges, by which alone, 
in the sorts of causes in question, correct justice is, by the 
supposition, capable of being administeredf. 
« Satisfied, let us even suppose then, that, by a jury, jus- 
tice in this behalf was incapable of being done, would any 
such determination be formed by them — would any such 
idea be so much as proposed to them, as that pi giving the 
name of a jury, to a body of men in which it had been 
predetermined that none of the properties of a jury should be 
ipund? would they — these representatives of the people — 
bring themselves to attempt putting any such imposition 
upon their constituents? I hope, and dare believe, they 
would not.— Deceit like this belongs to none but a class of 
•men trained up in the application and formation of that art 
and science, which is &om beginning to end the art anc) 
science of imposture. 



' Chap* V. SpecM Jury Corrupti&n^ h^^w protected, i^j 

Such as above, or sotfiiething like it, is the oourse taketi 
by King, Lords, and Commons, when to them it seems 
good to take upon them to make laws ; to make laws, taking, 
als they must be content to do, their chance for seeing,* or if 
it be more convenient to them, for avoiding to see, .those 
laws over-ruled:— over-ruled indeed, but happily always 
by men of transcendent - science, by whom, without the 
trouble bf studying it, the business of legislation is so much 
better understood. 

But King, Lords, and Commons,~ are a dull and slow* 
paced set: determining, nothing about ^c/j, till after thejr 
have been poring over, as well as prying into, facts. How 
much more easily are these things managed by a learned 
Judge ! When, at any time, he '* thinks U worth while'* to 
make a law, it need cost him but a word: nor is it nece$« 
sary even to that word, to contain M^zf^&, or any such 
heavy matter, at the bottom of it. 

Another thing might, in this case, be affirmed with some 
assurance: z;zz. that, were Parliament, at this time of day; 
to think fit to appoint, for this (not to speak of any other) 
purpose, instead of a jury, a permanent Board, in that ca^e, 
into the organization of any such Board, no such barbarous 
and 'flagitious feature would now be introduced, as should 
put it into the power of any one dishonest member, m 
over-rule, by his own single will, the opinion, and conse* 
quent will, of eleven honest ones* 

Parliament would, in this case, do in this particular, as it 
did in the case of the judicatory established by the GrenviUe 
Act : which judicatory cannot be defensible, but upon the 
supposition that what, in the case of jury trial, is called 
unanimity^ is indefensible.

At the same time, tliis inventiott of Aelr's being ificdn-

of the constitution, it became a matter of prime importance, 
i%at, of whatsoever shoukl be done for the extension ot 
even for the preservation of it,, the true nature and opera- 
tion should be kept as efiectually concealed and disguised a^ 
^RQfSsibte. 
• The remedy tbereforet whatsoever it might be, iM»s So be 



fnaje to posseK two characters j ^^ an osUnsibU one, aadil 
4icr€t one : in its ostensible chara^ier, it wai^ to bear upo9 all -dii 
Vfnt} without distinction : in its s^rct character it was s^ uf 
h(^ contrived, that» if at any tioae any untoward acdideiil 
shoi^ld happen to call for its heing carried into executid^ 
and e^ct, it should, in the ca^e of a special \\]^Ty^^ be fouii^ 
inapplicable : which sort of jury should cofisequently r^ 
main the seat of corruption and .^^ ip every iQoiwenitnli 
shape, notwithstanding any SBccess which, in the inatqilce 
of the ordinary and vuloar sort of jury, might have attended 
the measures taken for the extirpation of thos^ mischiefs. 
( , For this purpose various devices* part old part new, Ui^er« 
s<^t to work. An old established one was — the ruje they bMt 
long beifofe contrived to establish-^titz. that the Cfomfi 
(a. ^, as 9any members of gpyernment as could contrive to. 
get their interests included under that name) was never to bo 
considered as bound by atiy Act of Parliament, unless ex- 
pressly mentioned in it, which of course all per^ns ints« 
* rested would, on each occasion, take care that, if posftiblei^ 
i( shoold not be. 

By this rule alone, a gireat part of the design was already 
accomplished to their bands y fyr^ i^y this rule alone, special 
juries, with the benefit of an e^iemption from theobnoxiou» 
restrictions, which,, under the proposed new law, operated 4a 
a bar to sinister choice and perra%hence, might have boen 
preserved to all causes, in which, according to the established 
tormS) the Kir^ was nominally a party* 

Aut by this rule, if alone, the benefit of the exempttois 
would not have been extended to all causes to which ii 
should happen to have been brought under the cognisance 
of special juries. Under this cognizance they bad alteady^ 
^ their own amiiority, besides the above-mentioned rninf^ 
nal and other sorts of causes, brought in general all those 
which in Gontradi^inction to criminal are termed by them 
f22^ causes, comprehending together almost all sorts of 
causes: aotd to this extension tliey had the assurance. to ask^ 
and the good fortune to obtain, the confirmation of (he legis- 
lature, m and by this very Act. (3 Geo. s. c. 2g. § 1 j.) 

To complete the imposition, it then became necessary te 
employ a fuFther contrivance, for concealing from non«' 
learned eyes the completeness of the exemption meant to be 
established. 

^ , Th^ way in which they managed it is this :— >In the case 
of at special jury ^ ijie jurors, ias^id pf beiog determined as 



t6o Chap* V. Special yury Cotruptian^ kow prdutud, 

in the case of a common jury, were, as there has beeri 

;^ such frequent occasion to observe — were, as they always 

had been — " nominated^*' as the wbrd is in the books of 

Sactice, by the Officer of the Court — the Master. The 
asier then, for one at least, if not he alone, would have 
been ihe^ or at least a, person^ to whom, had the corrupt 
practice been in this case meant to be prevented, the prohi- 
bition would have been addressed. 

But to apply to this branch of the corruption ;— to the 
branch which was under their own management — any sort 
of remedy, was no part of their intention. Care was ac-t 
•ordingly taken that, to the efiect in question, neither to 
, this officer, nor to any other officer, by the staying of whose 
hand that part of the plague which was of their own nur- 
sing would be staid or checked, should the prohftition in 
question, or any prohibition, be addressed. 
- In the case of a comtndh jury, the sheriff, as above ob- 
served, was the person bf whoin, out of a much more nu- 
merous assemblage,' supplied to him under legal rules, by 
other hands (in the first instance by the constable of the se« |g 
veral townships} the choice was made. Corruption having 
risen to such a pitch, that the cries of the public had be- 
come troublesome, it was become necessary that the mis* 
chief should, in some quarter or other, receive a check. 

Common juries were the sort of juries in whose instance, 
/in comparison of special juries, the preservation of the fa« 
culty of corruption was, to the purposes of the Judges, and^ 
the other lawyers, of least importance : the sheriff, in whose 
haiids the choice of jurors of this class was more imme* 
diately reposed, was an officer, on whose obsequiousness, 
regard being had to his impermanence, and comparative in- 
dependence, they could not place any such reliance as upon 
that of the Master, their own permanent subordinate. 

The sheriffs it was accordingly determined — the sheriff 
and he alone — should be included in the prohibition : the 
Master, it was determined, should not be included in it; 

Such being the determination, what was the contrivance 
employed for carrying it into effect ? — It consisted in the 
employing of such words, and one word in particular, xnz, 
the word return, as, while to an unlearned eye they would 
appear to bear, alike in every case, upon the officer, be he 
who he might, upon whom, on each occasion, the compo- 
sition of the reduced occasional list, CSee above Chap. 4. § 3.^

ing, in the case of a special jury^ upon any suck person, 
or in effect upon any person, at all : and thus it was that^ 
for want of a person on whom the words in question could 
be found to bear, the supposed remedy was, in that case, to 
be rendered altogether inapplicable and without effect. 

Such accordingly will be found to be the virtut of that 
convenient and aptly chosen word— Hhe word return. The' 
sheriff was and is the person, by whom, in all cases, what 
is called the return, was and is made 1 — the return, i. e. the 
list of the persons summoned, or at least therein said by hinl 
to have been summoned, to serve on the occasion, in ques-^: 
tion, as jurors : which list was and is, in all cases, to be 
given in to the officer of the court. 

The difference, iri this respect, between the two cases^ 
was and is — that in the case of common jurors, the persons 
chosen for jurors, were and are, a number of persons greater 
than 24 fthe number contained in the case 01 a special jury 
in the reduced occasional list :) and so much greater than 24 
as to< constitute an aggregate out of which, in the case of at 
common jury, the actually serving lists for any number of 
causes, tried, as belonging to the county or other district 
in question, on the same occasion, {viz. at the same Assizes^ 
Sittings, or Sessions) are to be taken : and these are, all of 
ihem, of the sheriff* s own choosing, as above: in the cafd 
of special ']\xx<xs, they are chosen by the officer of the court, 
•—the Mfli/^r— the Master Packer, out of a list furnished ta 
him by the sheriff, being the same ** Gross list'^ that the 
sheriff himself has to choose out of : and the Master haying 
pitched upon the 94, sends an order, called a If^rit of Dis-^ 
iringas, inclosing the list (called the pannel) to the sheriff^ 
who has nothing to do but to summon the persons contained 
in that same list, and thereupon, in his answer, called hid 
return, to declare and certify his having so done. 

Let it not for a moment be supposed that, on this occa« 
sion, in framing for themselves this valve of safety, on the 
part of these scientific and ingenious operators^ any such' 
cause as inadvertence had any share. Return, is the word by 
which they found the choice designated when made by the 
sheriff :-—;7<^mi/^, when made by the Master, the officer o^

jurymen— ^that the Master never is said to " returrC* ^rymtn 
—these are matters, neither of which could, to these learned 
persons, or any one of them, apply ins their thoughts to the 
^ubject^ for a special and to themselves highly important 
purpose, have, for a moment, been a secret. Had it made 
any part of their intention, that special jurymen (the rich 
and welUpaid jurymen^ to whom sdone the exemption could 
^ave been of no use) should stand exempted from the over- 
frequent service, as well as common jurymen, (the compa- 
ratively poor and unpaid jurymen, to whom alone the ex- 
emption could be of any use) in this case, to the word de« 
signative of the act of the sheriffs by whom c^mm^n jury- 
men are chosen, they would have added the word designa- 
tive of the act of the Master, by whom special jurymen arc 
chosen: — to the word *^ return*' when employed for the 
description of the act meant, in this case, cq be prohibited, 
they would have added, the word ** j/ni^," or the word 
^* nominate.'' But their design being the reverse of this, 
such accordingly was the language employed by them in the 
execution of it. To the " return^' — the reiterated return—- 
of jurors, in the case of over'Served jurors^ the prohibition 
they framed was accordingly confined : to the nomination'^ 
thc^ reiterated nomination-^of jurors in the same case, the 
prohibition was not extended* 

To make it clear, upon occasion, that, in the provisions 
against package, permanence, and corruption, it could not 
have been the intention of this Act to comprehend the case 
of special juries, another argument was provided. 

when a prohibition is addressed to a man, care is usually 
taken that, in some way or other, he should find a motive for 
conforming to it. The operation meant to be restricted be- 
ing the act of the sherifT, and he the person to whom the 
prohibition is accordingly addressed, to constitute such mo- 
tive, an eventual penalty, bearing upon the conduct of the 
sheriff, is appointed, and denounced accordingly in the 
Act : to the Master, of course, no such nor any otner even- 
tual penalty is denounced. 

Now from this omission, if the prohibition is understood 
to apply to the case of a special jury, results a sort of in- 
congruity, by which the intention of the legislature, under 
the guidance of these learned persons, to exempt the Master 
Packer's corps of dependent special jurors from being dis- 
banded along with toe common jury corps, is put stil) more 
effectually out of dpubt. If in the prohibition, with th^ 



§.ik Dedce 1* Ltatnng the Act inapplicablt. 163 

annext ^nalty* put upon the ofEcial act, of which the ser- 
vice of over^scrved juries — viz, the too frequently reiterated 
{'ury-service in the instance of the same individual, would 
le the result — if in this prohibition special jurOrs are to be 
considered as comprised, one consequence is, that the 
sheriff would, in case of prosecution, have to pay the pe« 
^ nalty for an act done in obedience to orders made by the 
Master> and contained in the writ, called a distringas issued 
by authority of the Court: for, as hath been seen, it is, in 
the case 01 a spcdal jury, by the Master ezch time that the 
S4 persons to oe summoned by the sheriff to sdrve on that 
jury are nominated^ and as such included in the writ, as 
above, sent by him to the sheriff. Now then, to make a 
supposition, instead of leaving, between their times of ser* 
vice, the interval appointed by the Act^ in the case of coiii- 
mon jurymen, let the Master, in the case of two special 
juries who are to serve on two immediately following occa- 
sions, comjpose the two lists altogether of the same persons* 
This, if thie prohibition in question is to be understood as 
meant to comprehend special juries, is a direct transgression 
against the Act. 

That on this supposition, though it is by the Master (the 
Officer of the Courtj that the offence is committed^ it is not 
by the Master, but by another person, the Sheriff, that the 
penalty is to be paid. Such injustice, it would naturally be 
argued, cannot reasonably be supposed to have been the in- 
tention of tlie legislature. Therefore, concludes the argu- 
ment* be the remedy what it may, it was no part of the in- 
tention of the legislature, that it should be applied to the 
case of special juries. And, the inference being* if not 
strong enough to impose an obligation upon an unwilling 
Judge, quite strong enough at the least to afford a sufficient 
warrant to a willing one, the eventual inapplicability of the 
remedy to the case in which it is most wanted may, without 
much violence done to probability, be concluded. 

From these provisions against package and permanence, 
provisions which ought in reason to have applied in com«- 
mon to both sorts of juries* and which accordingly were in 
appearance made applicable in common to both sorts, the 
sort called a special jury was thus in reality exempt<^:--* 
which was the thing to be done*

§ 2. ptuice 2. Rendering it unadvisaUe for a Sheriff t& 

resist the packing. 

Possessed with the now antiquatied notions about the iiii« 
portance of real jury trial to liberty^ a meddling sheriff (it 
might at that time of day have been apprdiended) might at 
oneiime or other st^rt up, who, in the case of special juries^ 
observing juries packed, and formed into a standing corps^ 
in opposition to what might appear to him to have been the 
intention of the Act, might, in relation to this most import 
tant application of it, feel disposed to use bis endeavours to 
give effect to it. 

For the repression of any such Quixotism, it was expe* 
dient that provision should be made : and provision was 
made accordingly. 

If^ in the application of the Act to special juries, he 
would have greater cause of fear in the event of his using 
his endeavours to give effect to it, than in the event of his 
contemning it, the conclusion was— «ind, it must be con- 
fessed, not an unnatural one-*-that no such endeavours would 
be used. 

Contemning the Act (it was accordingly contrived)— con- 
temning the Act in this particular, and thus teaviing the system 
of package and permanence undisturbed— he would run no 
greater nor other risk, than that of having to pay a limited, 
and that at the utmost a minute, penalty t-^-a petty sum, not 
exceeding 5/. (3 Geo. 2. c. 25. ^ 4.) Supporting the Act, 
he would, in the instance in question (tor so also it was 
contrived) find himself to be committing an offence—an 
offence called a contempt of Court — and thereby subjecting 
himself to a mass of punishment altogether unlimited, and 
which, taking into account costs of defence, whether un- 
successful or successful, could not but amount to many 
times the amount of the penalty in the other case, as above* 
For, if the Master, as above, puts into a list of special ju^ 
Tors, (a list settled by him as above) any number of aoer- 
served sipccidA jurors, the order, given thereupon to tile 
slieriff, to return those along with the other special jurcM^t is 
a writ or order of the Court, disobedience to that writ or 
order an offence called a contempt of Courts and the punish- 
ment inflictable for that offence, imprisonment for a time

altogether unlimited, with or without nobody knows whtt 

beside. • 

At the worst, what was made clear was, that in Jeavii^th^ 
Act« in this respect, in a state of QuUity, and the system of 
|Kickage and permanence undisturbed, he could not have 
-any thing to apprpbepd. Called tq account (suppose him in

Another exertion of lawyercraft may be seen in the ciare 
taken to throw a veil of concealment over the arbitrariness «(

special jurors^ It is by him alone (as we have seen) that the

at this time of day, such is the progress that has been made, 
this arbitrariness may be seen stated without disguise in the 
Jkooks of practice; books written by lawyers for the informa- 
tion of none but lawyers, and without any apprehension of aiiy 
such jealous eye as, by accident, might be cast on the busi*

§ 4* Learned Advice given accordingly to Sheriff Phillips^ 

Thus it was, that this Act, which, at a time of ferment, 
and in the view of allaying the ferment, was, in shew and 
pretence, provided in the character of a check to corrup- 
tion in the case of jurors in general, special as well as com- 
mon, was at the same time, in the case in which the mis- 
chief of the corruption was at beyond comparison the 
highest pitch, (being the case wherein the interest which its 
]pretended extirpators had in maintaining and increasing it,) 
was also at the same high pitch, converted, as in the case 
of the lately exhibited remedy against parliamentary cor^ 
ruption—- converted by suitable management and with the 
happiest success — into a means of not only perpetuating, but 
aggravating the disease. 

Of the state of things here depicted — of the nullity of 
|hc power of Parliament— of the real supremacy ot the 
Judges-— of this state of things, the living Oracles, to whom 
pir Ricbar4 Phillips, as above, had, at different times, be^ 



• , - - - 

W i* Learned Advice given accordin^y to Sheriff Phillips . 167 

taken Himself for advice, were, both of them, as will be 
seen, duly sensible. 

This sheriff, being one of the .speculative kind of #nen 
above supposed— -ignorant, as all such men are — -ignorant of 
the real state of existing circumstances-^h^d been amusing 
himself with the fancy that King George is our King : that in 
consequence, disobeying King George a man would be in 
peril, and that to obey him was the way, and only way to 
be safe. 

These learned persons knew, both of them, better things. * 
Your King George^ said they, (to let you into the secret) is 
King Log:, Jump upon him, do any thmg else upon him yoU 
please. — King tllenborough^ King Mansfield^ King Macdo-. 
nald^ these are your real *• kings:" — ^these, should you ven- 
ture to disobey but the least of them, you will find him a 
King Stork. As to your King George to appeal to the laws 
of th^t nominal King, in justification of an act of disobe- 
dience committed « against the orders of any of these real 
Kings, doing so you would but make bad worse : doing so, 
you would but aggravate disobedience by " cdnlempt:'* yoii 
might as well appeal to Bonaparte, 

Such was their advice : and very good, and, as the Lord 
Chief Baron says of it, " perfectly just" advice it was. The 
language in which they gave it was of course their own 
language-^their own branch of the Jlask language : but the 
above is the honest English of it. As for the speculatist, 
the reformer, he found means to understand it, notwith- 
standing his ignorance : accordingly by these lanterns were 
his fjset directed, as wjell ^his paths lighted* 

As to the Lord Chief Baron^^so little in use have he and 
his learned colleagues been, to consider an Act of Parlia- 
ment as any thing, when their practice or their pleasure has 
been contrary to it, to him it was all the same whether in 
the case of special jurors, the package and the permanence 
bad or had not been prohibited by the Act : the exempthon 
provided in that case having been a covert one, it bad 
escaped his observation, and he determined accordingly to 
conduct himself as it seemed to him in disobedience to the 
law. 

But to the sheriff, who, had he taken upon himself to 
give effect to what seemed to him to be the intention of the 
tegislature, would have had to expose himself to the resent-* 
ment of the Judges, it was matter of serious anxiety tq ^n-' 
4e9vour to ascertain what support he might promise himselx 



|68 Chap. V. Special Jury Corruption, how protected. 

from the letter as well as from the spirit of the law. The 
learned framers of this law, not having as yet attained for 
t)ieq^elves, nor daring to promise to themselves, for their 
9ucc«sors^ any such complete and dauntless assurance as 
Jiath now been declared by their existing successors, had 
rtiade provision of their covert exemptions and loop-holeS| 
as above: and of these loop-holes, our intended Curtius^ 
the reforming sheriff, though be did not receive a perfectly 
complete or correct draught, received an intimation sufE* 
cientiy instructive to save hira from leapi^ig, to no p»irpose, 
into the gulph into which he had been prepared to tbrovr 
Jiimself. 

Thus in the way of useful instruction— instruction which, 
howsoever speculative, may at any time be made to lead to a^ 
jpractical purpose — the quantity of written matter unavoid-i 
ably e^cpended upon this contrivance in the art of packing 
inay be turned to as extensive an accpunt as possible, X 
would recopimend it to your consideration, gentle reader, 
in the character of a sample of the mode in which, in mau 
ters of law, the public has been always served, and may al- 
ways expect to be served, till by sijch servipe the destruc- 
tion of society is completed, so long as according to the 
existing order of things, it continues in the line of legisla- 
tive penmanship to be served by lawyers, meaning fee-fed 
lawyers: it will continue to be served as hitherto it ha^ 
been served— always with the same honesty— ^always witht 
the same viewsT^^il^^ys with the ^me effect. 



§ 5. Special Jury System— just Susjncion entertained of if. 

That all the artifice that could be mustered for the ocpa^ 
^ion was not more than the urgences of the case required^ 
may be collected from the particular recital prefixed, by 
Wi^y of preamble, to this very clause:-— a recital from which 
i% appears, that the indiscriminate extension of the special 
jury system to all causes, at the pleasure of the party on 
either side of the cause, had pot been regarded altogether 
IP^rithout distrust and opposition. " And whereas some 
*' doubt (says that preamble, 3 Geo. J2. c. 25. § 15.) hath 
** been conceived touching tpe power of his Majesty's 
" Courts of L.aw at Westminster, to appoint Juries to be 
•* struck before the Clerk of the ^rown^ Master of the 
•' Ofiice, Prothonotaries, or other proper Officers of such

" respective Courts, for the trial of Issues depending in the 
•* said Courts without the consent of the prosecutor or par- 
•• tics qpncerned in the prosecution or suit there depending, 
•* unless such Issues are to be tried at the bar of the same 
** Courts," Thus far the preamble: and then comes the 
enacting part still preserving the word iefore^ and giving to 
the party on either side, the power to force upon his adver- 
sary the sort of judicatory thus corrupted. 

As to " douht^ ' if we may believe what is said in the Report 
of a case determined in the )rear 1737, about seven years 
after the passing of this Act, there could he no doubt in thcj 
case: the contrary to what is here insinuated was true be<^ 
yond all doubt. No more than about four years before tbd 
passing of l^ie Act, a search had been made in this view^ 
tn thirty years then last past, that is from about the yeaic 
1695, to abotur the year 1725, ho instance of the ordering 
a special jury .witnout consent of parties on both sidet 
had been found : nor is it said that any instance had 
been found anUrior to that period. Notices of the existence 
of such a power had indeed been now and then thrown out, 
but which if that statement be believed (and no reason can be 
£ound why it should not) were without any foundation either 
in regulation or in practice: were thrown out, and not being 
true, in' fact, it seems difficult to imagine with what view 
they could have been thrown out, unless it were with the 
view of paving the way for this statute.* 

. • fPUks against Samei, Andrewi, p. 5% Midi. 11 Geo. a. anno 1737. The 
Court said, ** that though it was not usual, before the ssud Act, to grant speciid 
** juries without consent, yet in some instances, and for special causes, it was, 
** and might be done: .... And Lord Chief Justice cited the Kmg and 9or- 
*' ridgt, PaseKGeo. 10. when upon search it was found that no special jury had 
'* been granted for thirty yeans then last past without consent; and the Lord 
'f Chief Justice Pratt was Men of opinion, that ^e Coart might grant a special 
!* jury without consent, hot the other Jud^ di^red :" i*. e. were of opinion that 
the Court could not grant a speciad jury without consent. 

From this it seen^s that at beth periods die Chief Justices knew what they 
were about, and accordingly invented pretences for thus forcing in the special 
jury system: but that, in Pratt** time at least, viz, anno 1725, the Puisnes wttc 
not in the secret : inasmuch as they opposed the extension thus Oideavoared tp 
pe given to it. . 

From this it may be seen that a specid jury, m the character of a subject and 
instrument of package (unless 1>efore this time, the Crown Lawyers assumed, 
and by the Judge were permitted, to exercise a right of commanding a special 
jnry in Crown causes, as would naturally be the case) as well as a source of in- 
cresed laser's profit, took its rise horn this Act : and as well in the character 
pf an 9uanoml^»ac% of tom^Hon u in tiutt of a constant source of lawyei't

\ j. Harmony between the Astutia ^1730, and Do, §f i8o8. 

We come now to an observation* which brings the con- 
^deration of the so long ago enacted statute within the li- 

profit, !t has already been seen how Tahiable an engine it has proved in the ma- 
Mttfoctofy of abuse. 

In the character of an instrument applicable to the purpose of corruption^ oui 
estimate of Its value may receive some assistance firora a circumstance mentioned 
hi the same Report. In '< the case of the Corporation of Bewdley," the trial 
being at Batf twenty guineas a piece, it appeared, had been given to each juror. 
Kbr would the enormity of the sum have transpired, but for an application 
aaade by the losing party for what is there called " hwervigit,'' which the Coui^t 
4id : vix, to Jhe guineas : i. e, forbore to oblige the losing party to pay any more 
than five guineas, not obliging him to pay the twenty : . for, as for taking out of 
Ibe pocket of each juror 15 guineas out of the 20 he had received, that was alto- 
geAer out of the question c— that was what could not be done. The money was 
already in their respective pockets : and there was neither statute law not judicM 
fractice that could have furnished so much as a pretence for making them dift^ 
gorge it. 

In the same ease, in speaking of the quantum of the extra allowance giveii to 
Aese well-selected assessors, an observation made by Strange, Solicitor-Cfenerafp 
h — ^that *' though the practice is to pay them more than to common jurors, this 
*' is mere matter of generosity, and ought not to be reimbursed by the other 
(meaning the losing) party." 

All depending on generosity, and the Crown, i, e, its servants, and they alone 
luiving it in their power to be generous, and without bounds, as well as without 
mny expence to themselves, it may be imagined what sort of a chance an tndtvi- 
dzuil would have, under a set of jurors, all named by this one party, possessing, 
and all -along exercising, the power of either rewarding them» at the expence 
9f others, to an untimited ampunt, or not rewarding them at all, according as 
they behaved.. 

The Crown, had it or had it not a special jury at pleasure^ and not depending 
on the consent of the party on the other side ? 

A circuipstafice indeed that contributes to render it probable, from the first 
invention of special juries, the King, i «^ the servants of the Crown, never 
foiled to have a special jury of this sort for asking for, isT^the care which, at 
the early period above-mentioned, vu. the beginning of the reign of King ffil- 
Uam, was taken that, the faculty of striking out the 13 out of the 48 should noty 
on the part of either party, be exercised, without its being specially applied for, 
and on application ordered. 

And so lately as in the time of Lord Man^uH, it is stated as a rvle, that when 
tfie solicitor omits to attend after notice, the Master in K. B. may strike' the jury

In such cases as were left to a con^mon jury> that is in causes die importance 
|Df which was not sufficient to excite any interest in the bosoms of the Judges or 
Iheir connections, ciiance was the instrument they saw directed to be employed 
for the reducing the number on the Gross list to twelve— the number adapted tq 
the Serving Ust. Had justice been the object, here then was a principle and a 
frecedeni to have pursued. But in cases tliat w^ 4^^ worth their attention^ 



5 5* Harmony hetzoeen the Astutia £^1730, and i8o8« iji 

mits of the present epoch : I mean the use which, on the 
occasion in question, appears to have been made of it, bjr 
the Lord Chief Baron^ with the privity of course, and con* 
sent, all along, of his learned and reverend colleagues* 

The deficiency by which, in respect of the clause prohi- 
bitive of permanence, the Act was and is rendered inapplU 
cable to the subject of special juries had probably been ob- 
served and understood, but was not thought fit to be indicated: 
it was not to be indicated — why ?— lest peradventure» attract- 
ing parliamentary notice, it should be supplied* 

But, to the sheriff, in pursuance of the advice that hai 
been given him, vi^. from the Temple, it might have hap« 

these ministen of justice, knew better than to trust, in any degree, to cham» 
what might be seemed by prudence. 

In the case in Covsper before Lord Mansfield, 00 a curious enough ciicum- 
stance i^ the carelessness, real or simulated, of the Judge, in regard to the person 
by whom the twenty-four should be struck out, in case of a refusal on one side 
(in the case in question it was on the side of the defendant) to strike out die 
twelve — the right of striking out which, according to the practice, bek>iiged to 
each side, and consequently to that side. 

What the reason of the case plainly enough required was— that the party at- 
tending for the purpose (in the case in question, the soUcitar of the Croum^) 
should exercise kis right of striking out Ai5 twelve, and then, the dtfendanfs so&k 
citor making default, the right that belonged to him should, fiom necessity, be 
exercised by the supposed impartial officer, the Master, 

In thfs case both on the part of the counsel by whom the motion is made, and 
on the part of Lord Mansfield, the Judge, by Whom the prayer of the motion Is 
refused, an assumption made is— that in case of such defkult, it belonged to the 
Master, and him alone, alone to strike out the whole feur-and-twenty : that h 
twelve for the defendant who made defavU, and twelve for the soUdtar of the 
Crown, who made no default. 

In this case had there been any real distinction of interest and feelings, notfalqg 
could have been more palpably partial and iniquitous, than to put it into the 
power of one party, by thus wilfully making default, to deprive the other party of 
his right. Yet that apparent injustice — and this too to the prejudice of die 
Croum— was committed.— Why ? because between the servants of the Crown in 
the Juciida/ line, and the servants of the Crown in the og-enc^ line, the understand- 
ing was so entire, and because amongst them it was so pcrfiectly well understood.

pened to'bring the question before the Courts viz, in the 
tnode, in and by that advice, recommended. If so, his 
Jsordskip and thar Lordships were ready for him. On ar- 
guing the matter on the ground of <he statute, its originally 
intended inefficiency as to this point would have been 
■brought to light. Though not peiiiaps through malice, the 
would-be reformer would have been found a trespasser: and, 
in addition to Costs, (costs got by him in the negative sense) 
in addition to such his costs, accompanied with a reasonable 
dose of contempt in the form either of avowed contempt or 
pity, he would have got his labour fpr his pains. 

Against the hypothesis thus advanced, this or that passagie 
may be objected m which the prudence of the serpent' does 
jiot appiear quite sq conspicuous as ihe simpliaty of the 
dove. 

But should the Jact be even admitted, the inference has no 
need to be admitted along zoith it. In a line of action to 
which a man is accustomed, the most consummate skill it 
not incompatible with equally consummate awkwardness, in 
a line to which he is strange. 

. The line to which an English lawyer, and in particular 
an English Judge, is accustomed, is that of making the 
most of the abuses, of which the ciommon, alias unwritten, 
law, and in particular that branch of it which tegardsjs/- 
dicial procedure, has been made up, viz. by the hands, and 
for the benefit of his predecessors; of mjikmg his advantage 
of them on every occasion, of defending them as often as it 
may happen to them to be attacked: opposing every effec- 
tual remedy, and, as often as remedial measures cannot be 
kept out altogether, infusing, into such as are forced in, as 
large a proportion of insufficiency and mischievous|iess, as it 
may be found possible and prudent to introduce* 

The line which is altogether strange to him, is the line of 
honest and beneficial legislation: including the abolition of 
such mischievous and mefficient arrangements as may hap- 
pen to have taken place already as above. Accordingly, it 
is not by mere ill will — the immediate result of adverse in- 
terest — that a true-bred English lawyer, bred in the school 

• 

tet, so for as concerned the interests and wishes of the servants of the Crown 
jof all descriptions, whedier the person by whom the striking out were performed 
were the Master Packer or the Crown SoUcitor, the effect would be jiist the 
vame. Thus it is that to any scrutimxing eye the secret, had there been any, 
would have been betrayed. But there was no secret in the case : andf m to any 
wruUinxing eye there was none such within sight.

oi Coke and Blackstone^ is prevented from doing any thing 
well in the line of honest and beneficial legislation: it i» 
moreover by genuine and una£Fected dtmsightedness and 
awkwardness. ' ^ 

Even though the task to be performed were of iio stranger 
a complexion than that of making a pair of shots ^ the most 
expert as well as learned and eloquent Advocate that ever 
pleaded at an English bar^ or Judge that ever sat upon an 
English bench^ would probably find it matter of extreme dif- 
ficulty to make with his own hands any such article. But 
supposing the task to be the making of a cod^ of laws, in 
such case, even though by some strange revolution or me- 
tamorphosis, he were on a sudden to become personally 
reconciled to it, he would find much less difficulty in the 
making of a pair 6f shoes than in the making of any such 
code of laws as should prove to be (supposing such to be 
the quality required to be given to it) a really useful instru- 
ment in the hand of impartial* undilatory , unvexatious, and un- 
expensive justice. In the making of the shoes, nothing more 
iriisome could have happened to him, than the employing, in 
so relatively useless and unprofitable a work* the necessary 
quantity of labour and time: from the very first stitch to the 
very last he would not Iiave found himself under any such 
unpleasant necessity, as that of violating any ma^im or opi- 
nion, he had been accustomed to regard with affection and 
respect, or acting in ojpposition to the interests, opinions, or 
Jeenngs of any of his triends. In the making 01 the bene- 
ficial bo^y of the laws he would not only have to lament at 
every stroke of the pen, the misapplication of so much la- 
bour and time, but at every other line he would feel him- 
self running counter to some such favourite maxim or opi- 
nion, as well as running counter to the interests, diminish^ .

part in the business, viz. partly as having afforded guidance 

• " The Duke of Portland. . . . informed me. . . . Aat your Lordship thou|^t a 
** change in Lord Castlereagh's situation in the government desirable,-^provided 
•• it. : . . could be reconciled to Lord Castlereagh's /eeKng-*.— The Uvke of Port- 
** land. . . . told me that hopes were entertained. ... of focilitating a general ar- 
**' rangement, in which a complete change in the war department might be efi^ted 
*' consistently with Lord Castlereagh's feelings,*' See in Cobbett*s Register, 
Hec. 3, 1809, the letter of Mr. Ex^ecretary Canning to Earl Camden, Lord 
President of his Majesty's Council, in which the conduct of a war on which die 
&te of the human species depends, is, for near six months together, viz. from 
2d April to 30th September 1809, in the minds of the Minister who writes this 
letter, the Minister to whom this letter is written, and the other Ministers in 
Seneral, stated and shewn to have been a secondary consideration t the j>rima7^, 
vid during that whole time the prevalent, consideration being th^ feelings of m 
single individual : that individual, a Minister whose unfitness for such his em- 
ployment had during all that time been recognized, viz, eithear by every one or 
Vy almost every one of his colleagues : — and such colleagues ! 

Now in any such Cabinet (not to speak of contingent ones) suppose a proposi- 
tion brought forward for the making of siny such code of laws as should be sub- 
servient to the purposes of cognoscible, impartial, tmdHatory, unveocatious, ttnex* 
J^enswe, justice. On what circumstance would the reception given to it depend i 
Answer— on its being capable of being made ** consistently with," or ** of be- 
** ing reconciled to" the " feelings" of the great character whose seat is at the 
liead of the law. — Vfctt It to happen to the rule of action to be cognoscible, 
impartial, and in all its other points, in the highest degree, or iaany higher degree 
than at prc;sent, subservient to the greatest happiness of the greatest number- 
were the recourse to it rendered, in any degree, less dilatory, vexatious or expen- 
sive, than it is at present — this would, in all its points, hie a result opposite to 
the interest of that great character in all its points— in'z. money, power, ease, 
reputatimiy vengeance, with their et cateras: also to that of the several learned* 
and noble and learned, and other great characters his colleagues, and other his 
friends. Such is the prospect which the law has of seeing itself wtW- conducted. 
As to the war, had that been well-conducted, the result, so far from being in 
any point opposite, would in every point have been, and in a high degree, sufc^ 
servient to the intere^ of the grt»t character by whom it would have been so 
conducted.

to the sheriff, partly as having helped to afford legal notice 
tq^ and / been honoured by the declared approbation of the 
Lot'd Chief Baron, the reader will probably expect to see it 
laid before, him here^ instead of his being sent in |[uest of it 
to another publication. 

I proceed therefore to exhibit a copy of it, subjoining, 
in the form of Notes ^ a few observations of the propriety 
of which the reader will judge. 



-« To Mr. Sheriff Phillips. 

" Dear Sif, 

** I agfiee with you in thinking, that the clause referred ta 
in the^closed Act of Parliament applies to special as well 
*• as common jurymen \* for if it be inconvenient f for the 
*' latter to attend oftener than the Act requires, it roust b« 



«^( 



* AppUes to special. . . .jufymen,'] This is the clause, forbidding the summoning 
aad returning of over-served jurymen: this tht passage, which drew (a9 we have 
seen) from the Lord Chief Baron, the avowed persuasion, that the practice he had so 
long been pursuing, and was then defending, was a practice meant to be prohi- 
bited, and prohibited accordingly, by parliament. But that, in this persuasion, 
as well the learned Judge as the learned Counsel, whose observations he found 
so <* perfectly jusi,** were perfectly mistaken, has, in the last preceding chapter, 
been shewn at large. 

•f* If incoTfvement far the latter to attend., ,, much more to the former^ In- 
convenient to a guinea- fed juryman to attend oftener than the Act requires!— 
About as inconvenient as to this learned gentleman it is to have too many 
briefs. Mfhen the briefe crowd in too thick upoxi him, he returns the over- 
plus : when the summonses crot^d in too thick upon the Guineaman, he, the 
Cuineaman, obeys such as be finds it agreeable and conveniens to obey, and 
neglects the rest. 

Note that of the 34 who, for each cause, are always summoned, it is but 12 
Aiat, in any one <^use, can ever serve : therefore every other time of his being 
summoned, each special juror, or in other words' half the number summoned, 
might| if the inconvenience were real, stay at home without being missed: and, 
to a majority composed of these gentlemen, suppose even a few yeomen juroca' 
added, «». in the character of talesmen, who would ever care about it ? 
. Of the terrific ./&M^>rhich (by the Act of which the Act in question is an 
amendment) is, in case of non-attendance hung over the heads of jurymen, 
were I to add that it does not extend to special jurymen, his reply would be of 
Goursfr— oA, htit this is according to the construction you put upon the Act .'"^-minB 
was different, — Be it so. But what reason could a sheriff have for supposing^ 
that when he was sending; an invitation to a gentleman, to partake of a good 
dinner, in good company, after sitting to act the part of a Jpdge, aqd to receive 
moreover a guinea at the least, and perhaps a number of them, he vras putting 
him to *' inconvenienced* or if, in the instance of this or that particular gentle- 



1/6 Chap. VI. Learned Advice /fern (he limpte. 

** much more so lo the iotxAer^ on aiccount of their rani and 
'* station in life.* . 



nan it were qp inconvenience, what is there that eould prompt a sheriff to be 
too frequent in the reiterated production of such iooonvenience?- 

Note that, in those days» a guinea was worth at least twice what it is worth aC 
present. 

Twenty years or thereabouts after the passing •f this supposed inconvenience- 
producing Act, (take for the Act either the migwU Act of the s Geo. 2. or the 
amending Act of 4 Geo. 2.) the topic of special juries came again upon the car- 
pet: and what was the complaint then?— ^at, in the ch9ractert)f special jury* 
men, g^ndemen were put to inconvenience by over-attendance?— No >-that 
they were oppressed?— no: but that ttiey were over-pampcre8 :— that ** great 
"and extravagant fees were paid to them :"— and ** {/regueni** are these com- 
plaints declared to have been by the Act (24 Geo. 3. c. 18. § 2.) 

♦ Incoiwenient U must he much more. ...on account of ranJfe.] What we 

have just been seeint;, is a specimen of the sort of regard paid by the fcatemity 
of lawyers to the convenience of gentlemen jurors— the class of jpors, whose 
convenience is entitled to regard :— let us now observe the sort of 14^ P^ bj 
the same learned fraternity to the convenience of common jurors— low people, 

whose convenience is entitled to to what? to any regard ? — ^to this cmic 

knows not exactly what to say : — either to none at all ; or, if to any, to next to 
none. 

Instead of convenience, we might say f»Ung$, Since the use made of it for 
crushing the liberty of the press, yeeZtng5, always the more sentimental, is be* 
come the more legal term. 

To a man wtio, in the sale of his time* finds the sole source of his subsist* 
ence, less inconvenient to sacrifice a portion of his time for 8<2. than to a man to 
whom not only subsistence but aiBuence is secured, and ikdit without the sak «f 
any part of his time, it is to sell, on this particular occasion, the same portion 
of his time, receiving for ir, besides a very good dinner, at the least one guinea^ 
This is the proposition, with the supposed truth of which the learned gentleman, 
was not only possessed, but to such' a degree captivated, that, under the guise of 
%,Teasoii, introduced in form by the word yor, it led him astray into what we have 
seen to be an erroneous conception, or at any rate an errpneous declatatioa, of 
the meaning of an Act of Parliament. 

Such is the proposition, which, in this its character of a reason, stands at tlip 
head of those *' observations** which, in the sight of the pre-eminently learned 
Judge, were so ** perfectly just :** and which, in that of another learned Barrister, 
who dates from Liiuolns Inn, will be soon seen to be so *^ perfectly clear and 
" correct.*' 

The information thus afibrded is no light matter :— inasmuch as here we see, 
expressed in 2/x>r(2«, the sort of regard, which the convenience, the fadings, tho 
interests, — (any of these words may alike be employed) — the interests (say) ol 
the vast majority of the people, may expect to experience ^t the hands of law- 
yers of all sorts and sizes, official as well as professional : the same sort of re« 
gard which stands expressed by deeds, in the sort of law, framed by these same 
learned haiids— for the use shall we say— no, any tbiog biu the ««e— of that 
same despised portion of the people. 

In this sketch may be seen a picture— a fiimily picture— of the fraternity of 
English lawyers ;— a picture which cannot be charged with hostile disiortioii or 
discoloorment, since it is drawn by their own hands. 

From this view of it might be fofmed^ d priori, a cosoBptun, oi te ircil-

** But with regard to the sherifF, I think there is a vnry 
'* «E|teriaI distinction between common and special juriet. 
*• wjh respect to the former, the returning them upon tbc^ 
** vemre facias rests with the sherifF; and as he is required 
•• by the 5th section of the stat. 3 Geo. a. c. 25. to enter 
** or register in a book to be kept for that purpose, the names 
** oJF such persons as shall be summoned, and serve as jurors 

ment which, by sad esperience, this portion of the people fed nther than tee 
themselves to have met with at their hands: what they have met withj and foe 
ever may justly expect to meet with, so long as, in Blackstone's sense and words^ 
'' eoer^ thing is as it shintidbe,** 

Not ^at they are altogether devoid of sympathy :-^fbr no human being was 
ever altogether devoid of sympathy. But as is but coo natoial, their sympathy, 
such as it is> is confined to the classes with which they associate or wish to as- 
sociate : and having, as we have seen, been so liberal of it to the disdnguishc^ 
few abo^e-<>the men in high situations — they huve hone left for the undistin- 
guished racitftode beneath. 

Hence it is that in Engtand (nor indeed in England only) the people have come to 
be divided into two classes : one, of those tt> whom josdce is to be sddf the other, 
of those to whom justice is to be cZemed;— denied, for the benefit of t^ose wh(» 
alone can come up to the price : and Who by that means are authorized and re- 
quired to purchase the foeulty of oppressing, under the name, iind with the 
power of justice. 

This is the authoritative comtnent upon Magna Ckarta >^ht comn)ent, 
written, day after day, by the fee-fed hands of ^e kvelve Judges : not forgetting 
the one supremely leaimed person, who sits at the head of the law, in tbisu 
well as so many odier senses. 

That a poor maii eftn better a£fi>rd to work iat nothing than a rich mate, (fbt 
dits, tfaoogli a short interpretttioni is a sufficiently correct one) is a psoposition 
of that sort, which it seems imix>ssible for any xnan to repeat, who, after notice 
given him that it will t)e looked into, should bestb^ on it a second glance. But 
how impossible soever it may be for a man seriously to think so, nothing can be 
iBOre easy to a man than to lay so : and when such is the state of his f^Hngs, 
that, while those of the higher classes are something to him, thQae of the lower 
classes are as ncfthipg, it is no less natural for him to say of the workirig class 
that they can zSbrd to be made to work for nothing, and that they dpn't mind 
being made to work for nothing, than it was, to the CooRto $ay of her eels, that 
tAcy do/ft mind being skinned. Why. flid not the Cook's eeU mind being skinned ? 
beokuse thqr were used to it. Why do not ^ic Lord Chief Baron'^ common 
jttrofs mind being made to work for nothing.* becaiuse they are used to ii, Tiic 
Cook for her wages is used to see eels skiimed without minding it : and the Lerid 
Chief Baron, for his fees, and those of his friends, is used to see the great 
majority of the people outlawed and stripped to the skin, without minding iU' 
In both cases the construction is ambiguous; but in both cases the import is 
dear enough. 

*' Perfectly just" as this mode of doing justice to rich and poor is, it seihnii, it 
present, it has not been looked upon in that light by all Judges at all times.

would not; viz, if by any one it happened to be found " worth while^^ tb bring 
'the matter before them :— and, at any rate, this was a very good advice. 

+ pyorth yoiir while,] This is the passage which hit so exactly the taste of 
"the Lord Chief Baron, and which accoidingly, in the character of an aigument 
ad hominem, he made use of, in the representation made by his Lordship, as wc 
have seen, to the sheriff, in hopes of engaging him to give up so romantic a 
scheme. Would you give execution, would you pay obedience, to an Act of 
Parliament?— think first whether it be worth while:— if it be not worth while. 
Who ever (i. e. which of us ever?) thinks of paying obedience to an Act of Par- 
' liament ? 

X To rectify the practice.] Kec<j/y— as applied to jDradice— to the practice of 
Judges — to his own practice — this was a word which has been seen to be— and 
' indeed might without much expence of thought have been expected to prove — 
net altogether to the learned Judge's taste : accordingly, as we have seen, and 
for what reason we have seen, slips in the word reform Instead of it. For,

Chief Baron ': while his learned brother on the other side of 
Fleet-street, less fortunate in the date of the applicatiort 
made to him, missed thereby iht having been admitted to 
so much as a chance of so honourable an advantage. 

Why then introduce him, or Kis letter, here ? says a na- 
tural question, and by no means an irrelevant one. The 
answer i«-— because it is upon the evidence of this gentle- 
man that the existence of the Guinea corps, arid the notoriety 
of such its appellation rest* 

A» to his title to credence" — a remark that had been made 
already, is-— how improbable it is, that if a matter €ff faot, 
stated as notorious^ were not really so, it should be men- 
tioned^s such by a professional man circumstance as ihris 
gentleman slppearg to be. True it is, t^at from tbe mention 
made by him of this Guinea corps, a suspicion might arise, 
that feelings were harboured by him, heretical and rebeUi^ 
ous^ aa towards the powers that be : and that it was for the 
gratification of these wicked feelings that be had trumped 
up this story about the- Ouinea corps, that statenaent having 
in fact no truth in it.

§ 2. . The Letter with Annotations. 

" To Sir Jlichard Phillips, 

*^ Ifincobi^S'Inni Sept. i, i8q8, 
•• pear Sir, 

•• Inclosed you will receive the Act relating to the sum- 
^' moning of Juries on trials at Nisi Prius^ and the three let^ 
^* ters''' with the perusal of which you have favoured me. 

** In respect to the Act itself, it appears to have been 
•* passed with the sole intention of relieving those trho arc 
^* liable to serve on juries^ from the inconvenience which 
** they were before subject to, from their constant liability 
•• to be summoned from term to term, without any consi- 
^* deration or respect paid to the labour of their previous at- 
** tendances, and it is most clear that it did not originate in 
** ^^y j^alousyf entertained that men so summoned and 

* The three letters.'] These most evidently have been, the three letters above re- 
|»rinted, in so many preceding phapters: vix, 1. the letter dated from the Temple ; 
9. Sheriff Sir Richard Phillips to the Lord Chief Baron; s. the Lord Chief 
Baron*s answer to the said Sir Richard Phillips. 

f Most clear that it did not originate in any jealousy, ftfc] Here we see the 
first of the evidences above ajluded to, by which the purity and simplicity of 
these learned eyes stand demonstrated. Not only are they (as we shall see pr^ 
sently) inaccessible to any suspicion-exciting ray capable of being emitted from 
any other source, but, when the tendency of an Act of Parliament might be to 
^cite any sort of suspicion capable of pdinting itself towards ^e higher powers, 
they are inaccessible to the very first words of the Act. 

The Act, I mean the earliest, the most efficient, and by far the longest, of the 
fi>ur or five Acts which bear upon the subject, (3 Geo. 3. c. 35.) states, in the 
Very first tine of it, as the very cause of its enactment " the evil practice used in 
f' corrupting of jurors:" and it is with these words before him (or why were they 
not before him ?)' that to this learned person '* it is most clear that it did not ori- 
f* ginate in any jealousy entertained that men so summoned and serving, would 
f * Haiil to act uprightly between the parties." No : the intention, " tlie sole wn- 
** tentum of it," is stated by him as being that of mitigatirig the sort •( vexation 
which, the instant a perception arose that the breast of a gentleman stood exposed 
|o it, made that deep impression^ which we have already witnessed, on the feel- 
ings of ^h^ learned Judge. 

What is possible indeed is-«-(hat t^e Act which at that moment lay befo^ 
|hat gendeman was-'- not the very Act above-mentioned, but another of the 
next year; viz. that of 4 Geo. 9. c. 7. But this last mentioned statute, being 
but a patch put upon that other of the year preceding, is so jndented into tt, 
ihat to any one who had not taken the trouble to turn to the amended Act, any 
self-satisfoctory rpnception of the amending Act would be plainly impossible. 

By the Act of the ;th Geo. 2, c. 7. § 2, after recicipg that by the Act s Geo. 2*

•* Mr. ***, than whom no man can be better inforrai(J

«< servations,t and in his statement of the manner in whicb 
" Special Juries are struck. 

" One circumstance ought to be attended to, which must 
*' remove all suspicipnX on this subject: it is this, that Spe-. 

c. 25. it had been enacted,* that '' no persons shall be returned as juron to serve 
<m trials at Nisi Prvui" *' who have served within. . . . two 3rearsbefiDre. ... in any 
**.,,. county**. . . . except as excepted ; and that ** by reason of the frequent 
** Sessions of Nisi Prius in the. . . . King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Ezche- 
" quer at Westminster, the said provision cannot be put in execution in the 
'< County of Middlesex, but is< found impracticable" — it is (after this recital) 
enacted, that ** the said recited chiuse. . . . shall not. . . . extend to the County of 
" Middlesex.'* Then, as to that County, it goes on aiid enacts, that ** no per- 
" son shall be returned to serve as a Juror at any Session of Nisi Prifis in the 
** County of Middlesex, who has been returned to serve as a Juror at any such 
** Session of Nisi Prius in the said County, in the two terms or vaccUions next 
** inunediately preceding'*— -><* under such penalty upon the sheriff, under- 
** iherifi^ bailiff, or other officer, employed or conceraed'in the summoning or 
** returning of juries in. . . . Middlesex, as might have been inflicted on. . • . any 
** of them for any offence against the said vecited clauses." 

• ** Between the parties" Note of Sir Richard PhilUpi t& these words.] *« It- 
'* should be observed, that the persons who serve on Special Juries rather desire 
'* the employment than to be relieved from it, as they receive a guinea for every 
** cause; and it is not about causes between individuals on which there can be 
** any ground of jealousy. So far are Special Jurymen from seeking to be re-» 
** lieved, that, owing to the advantages derived £rom serving on them, I have re- 
*' ceived, since I have been sheriff, more than a hundred applications from re^ 
** spectable persons, who, under a mistalen notion that it was inony power, have 
" wished me to place them on what they called the SpecialJun/ List," " R. P.'* 

t Mr, *•♦• is perfectly clear and correct in his observations.'] Mr. •♦•• : vix, 
the learned gentleman who dates from the Temple : and of whose learning we 
have already made our profit : viz. in the last preceding chapter. 

On that occasion, at the bead of those observations of his which were so 
<' perfectly jitst" we saw the lawyer's baUarice^ for weighing the value of gentle^ 
men*s time against the value of low peofde*s time : and, with the correctness of 
these scales, as well as with the several other observations from the same learned 
quarter, .the learned inhabitant of LincoIn*s-Inn, is (we here see) no less ** per^ 
**fecUy" satisfied than we have seen the pre-eminently learned Judge. 

Like causes produce like effects: he who sees one of these learned persons, 
sees another : he who sees Bavius sees Msmiw. An observation to this efiect 
has been made already: but the occasions for repeating it succeed one another 
without end. 

X One circumstance. . • . must remove all suspicion^ Remove it? — ^fixmi what

against all suspicions pointing upwards, remains of course for ever closed :— not

i86 Chap. VII. Advice from Lincoln* s -Inn. 

Gentle reader, patience. The reform is of the teniperate kind— compOH^ 
yoarselC •* WhoUy in the Sheriff* i power ,** says the learned inveptor and advi» 
ser of this reform. VHioUy out of my pmver^ (in the note We dflk see to this 
same letter) says the Sheriffs and so accordingly (as we have seen, and shaM 
iurther see) says the Act. 

With all his dispositions to find " perfectly correct** wluitever came from 
above, or came recommended from above, it may be suspected of this learned 
gentleman, that he was — not completely in the secret. T6 the permanence, so 
4ecidedly approved and eflfectually protected by the learned Judged he sees not 
indeed the shadow of an objection : yet the sort of persons who, beyond aU 
tfhers, could be depended upon, not to say who alone could be depended upon, 
%n%. for constancy of attendance, and for that obsequiousness without which 
constancy of attendance would have been of no use, these are the soft of pet- 
tons whom so hardheattedly, as well as inconnstendy, we see him thus deling 
plans for getting rid of: though, to b^ sure, if, while he was thus giving the ad- 
vice, he knew it to be an advice that could not be pursued, as he must have done 
IhuI he looked at the Acts on which he grounded it, << the case is altered," and 
both these imputations vanish. 

As to the question just mentioned, between the sheriff and this his learned 
i^^iser, it stands thus : 

The statute s Geo. -2. c. 25. is the only one that has any bearing upon the 
•abject: and, upon the ground of this statute, the matter stands thus: 

1. By § 17* " where any Special Jury shall be ordered by Rule of any of th^ 
.*< said Courts to be struck by (here it is << by*' not ** before") die proper officer of 
** such Court. ... the Sheri£ . . . shall be ordered by such Rule to bring. . . . be- 
** fore such officer, the books or lists of persons qualified to serve on Juries. . . . 
** out of which Juries ought to be returned by such sheriff. . ..in like wanner as 
*' the Freeholders Book hath been usually ordered to be brought, in order to the 
** striking of Juries for Trials at the Bar. . . . and in every such case the Jury shall 
** be taken and struck out of such books or lists respectively." 

And in what manner, on the occasion thus alluded to, had the Freeholders* 
■"Book been usually ordered to be brought for the purpose so alluded to ? This is 
lunong the points, in relation to which the lawyers concerned in the putting to- 
i;ether this piece of patchwork took care, according to the custom among 
lawyers, to leave us. in the dark. For, as often as, by the cry of any part of the 
injured people, they have been forced to make a show of affording relief against 
this or that part of the system of judicial abuse, organi2ed by, and for the bene- 
fit of, the Judges, one of their maxims is — to leave the comrfum alias unwritten 
)aw of their own making to form the groundwork, applying to it no more than 
here and there a patch of. statute law : that thus the uncertainty, which forms the 
essential character of the groundwork, may spread itself over the patch. 

3. In § 1. and 3. of this same Act, directions'had been given for the making 
up of ** Books** containing Usts of persons qualified to be returned to serve on 
Juries : and this without any distinction mentioned as between Common and 
Special Juries. In that section ($ 17.) by a reference made from it to these two 
former ones, (§ 1. and 2.) nothing (it would seem) would have been more easy 
than to say— that the Books, made up according to the direction given in these 
two sections, (§ 1. and 2.) are the Books here meant by ** the Books** which 
here, for the purpose of nominating persons to serve on Special Juries, << oughi 
*^ lobe returned by such Sheriff" 

But, by an understanding among the lawyers within and without both Houses, 
mnd the clerks within the same, and the Speakers to whom belongs the nomina- 
tion of the said clerks, matters have all along been settled, in such sort that, be 
t)ie statute ever so long^ it shall be impossible, otherwiiie than by words of vagi^c 



§ 2. The Letter with Annotations. 187 

iescriptum, to make any reference, from any part of any statute, to any part clF 
the same or any other statute. 

In the printed editions (it [s true) we see each statute divided into sedionsy and 
each section numbered. But this is the work of the printer only or his editof: 
and a man who, in the penning of any fresh statute, should, for the purpose 
of making a reference to any preceding statute or part of the same statute, be 
unguarded enough to make use of any part of the muneration table in the de- 
jBcription of such preceding statute or part of a statute, would find himself over- 
whelmed, with expressions of rage and terror, excited by so fee-checking an 
innovation— rage and terror, covered by a mask of contempt, as if excited b^ 
tk)ie contemplation of his ignorance, 

Fbr on t\^e one hand clerks being paid for copyings according to the multitude 
of statutes and the len^h of each, and the confusion thus organized in Qacb 
producing a perpetually increasing demand for more— lawyers, on the other 
liand, beipg, some of them, paid in like proportion for the drawing of statutes, 
^nd qU of them having every thing to gain by the cor^sUin that pervades the 
substance of the several statutes, and\be tmiversaJ axid perpetually increasing; 
uncertainty t in which that confusion beholds its fruit—hence this rule, by which 
it is provided, that an Act of Parliament, let it of itself constitute ever socan* 
siderable a volume, shall, like the mathematician's point, be a thing niMoui 
parts, is a rule as sacred am(ing these several learned aiy! official persons, as any 
article in the 39 ever wzs to the most orthodox of the Right Reverend Prel^tteSy 
that grace and sanctify the Upper House : and, whoso should propose to abro* 
gate it, would thereby become a worse than a popish or other ipso facto excom- 
snunicated convict — a malefactor ipso facto convicted of jacobinism. 

Ii> regard to this article, symptoms of heresy have now and then, it is true, 
\)een manifest^, in the Commons, in so high a quarter as the chair of the pre- 
sent Speak^: (See Speech of th,e Right Hon. Charles Abbot on Jiff. Curwen's 
Purity of Parliament Bill in Cobbett's Register for June 10, I8O9, to which, 
former inanifestations of the like complexion might upon search be added) 
but in this heresy there is so little of contagion, that the British TTiems seems 
little more in danger of being healed of her habitual vertigo by this one hand, 
than the Church of Rome was of being purged of her errors by the Pope, who, 
about the middle of the last century had acquired, some how or other, the sur- 
name of the Protestant Pope, 

" The Books or Lists of persons qualified to serve on Juries. . • . out of vrhich, 
*' according to $ 17, Juries ought to be returned by such Sheriff," are they then 
fhe same Books or Lists, the manner of making up which is prescribed by the 
two first sections of this same Act ? — ^Vague and incompetent as is the mode of 
description,, it seems difficult to conceive, how, if called upon to give by his 
interpretatioii^ an answer to this question, a Judge could avoid answering it l|i 
the affirmative. 

If so, wjiat. the Sheriff, in his above-mentioned, and herein-after printed. Note 
(p. 100.) on this part of the advice of his learned advisers, observes, hi relation to 
this matter, is correct: viz. that it is not " in the power of the Sheriff" — of an^ 
Sheriff— to do that which by this his learned ac^viser this Sheriff is advised te do^^ 
vix. " to correct *\ the Freeholders* List by expunging. . . . names." For, if thg 
Books, a description of which is given in die above-mentioned two first sections 
r-and of which it appears that they are the only sort of Books to which the appella* 
tion of '* Preehplders* Book,** pmplcyed in this 17th sectiooj can apply— are really 
the Books that, under this same 17th section ought '* to be brought before the said 
** Officer" — (to wit the Master Packer of such Cj^e in such CtwrO— to serYjt 
fbr the striking of Special Juries, these are Books, of which in § a. it is proN>

**faUhJuUy entered alphabetically. ... in some book. ... to be kept by him. . . . 
** for tnajfe purpose." — *' In such dupUaUes" says the Act : of which sort 6f instm- 
Aetit here called a duplicate it is to the present purpose sufficient to observe, that 
it b an instrument of somebody els^s making, and not of his, tTte. the Sherifi : 
and whether, had Mr. SherHF Phillips, in pursuance of the advice herein given 
to him by this his learned adviser, " expunged^ amy of the names contained in 
such duplicates, the " names. . . . contained in such duplicates** would have 
been *' entered faithfully ,* may be left to any man to pronounce. 

A course indeed^ which might be taken without much difficulty— I meanp&y- 
aiffl/ difficaity— is, after entering the names '* faUhfuRy,** to pursue the advice 
igiven by this leametf adviser, and accordingly, either once for all, or toties ^««- 
tiej, to ** expunge* names. But whether, after any such purification or nutn:- 
her of purifications performed, the book presented to the Officer of (he 
Court — vi%. the Master Packer, As and for iht freeholders* book, could with 
propriety be said to be the freeholders* book, is another airicus question, which 
Dowsoever curious, and to those who would be paid for playing their parts in the 
trial of it, an agreeable one, I would not be the man to advise any other man to 
.tause to be tried at his expence. It is one of those questions, in respect of 
Which it is difficult to Conceive how, in case of its being tried, for <example, on 
an indktment, a Chief Judge, in his endeavours to persuade either a Jury, dven 
though unpacked, or his fellow Judges, to decide— either for the King or for the 
'defendant, whichsoever happened for the moment to find most favour in his 
sl^t— could experience any difficulty: and as for this our refonning Sheriff, 
supposing him, in pursuance of this learned advice,' to have become such de- 
fendant, what sort of favour he could reasonably expeet at the bands of the 
learned Judge who, in that case, would have the trying of him, may he left for 
him to imagine from the excursion which, in the case of Carr against Hood, 
was made not Ibng after by that same learned Judge*, vix, if not for the pwc" 
pose, to xhtj^ect of giving him a sample of it in the character of a witness : 
always remembering that, of such purification, if performed with any degree of 
consistency and steadiness, the ^ect would be, as in his instance it had been the 
declared object, to make things better Hum toeU ; and in so doing to destroy not 
' only the works, but the very principle, of that elegant art — that branch of the 
art of design — which exercises itself in the^ grouping of Jurors : — an art, the 
planting and cultivation of which has already been afibrding so much occupation 
to the wisdom of ages. 

The case is — that the statute in question, having, like most other statutes, 
htetk penned, as above, for the express purpose of being misconceived, has, iii 
Itonuance of that purpose, been put into such a form and method, that, both 
the learned adviser and his official client and corrector, found it more easy and 
pleasant to speak from imaginatum than from the Act, 

It was the imagination of the learned adviser, that presented him with the 
idea, of its •* being wholly within the power of the Sheriff * to correct the list" 
In question, by " expunging names" out of it. It was the imagination of the 
Sheriff, that presented Mm widl the idea, that ** to make any alteration in the 
*' returns" is liot merely " forbidden," but " fbrbidden under a * penalty,* and 
" that a heavy one." 

As to the ommion— <u(id let us add the expwnction — of names, of the descrip- 
tion In question ; forbidden it may indeed be said to be, though in the rather iif- 
direct way we have just been seeing, viz. by requiring that the names of the 
persons contained in such duplicates htfaithfidly entered: but, to the oflence 
of which this indirect description is given, no penalty is attached. 

In dl'e next section, it Is true, viz. $'tf. comes a clause, by wtdcfas-penUty is 



1^ 2« The Letter with Annotaticns. 189 

" wholly withia the power of the sheriflF,* and that is, ta 
" correct the freeholaers* list, by expunging the names of 
** all such persons who, from low situations in life have 
** crept into a little independence, and by artifice and collu- 
" sion with the inferior officers, get their names placed 
•* upon the freeholders* lists with the proper additions, with 
•*^ a view principally to their adding to that independencet 

i^fNnnted. But the o&noe to which this penalty is attached, is-«~not that 
which consists in the leaving out of a list of the sort in question, a name which 
ousbt to be ta it, but in the putting intq it, or at least acting as if there had been 
put into it, a name which ought nat to have been in ft. 

Then, as to the <^ heaviness** of the penalty, if the real and efifective weight ht^ 
here in question, vis. the weight of it as estimated by the quantity of money 
which the levying of it takes out of a man's pocket — ^if this be what our Sheriff 
bad uk view, very inadequate was (speaking with respect) the conception en- 
tectained by him, for the moment at least, of the reail and effective weight of 
statute penalties. Of the penalty here in question, the rrUnimum is no more 
than forty shillings, and the maximum but lol. But even this lol, if lol, it be^ 
i$ not to be levied but " upon examination in a summary way" (§ 3.) ia the 
manner herein intimated : in which case, at the expence of 10/. at the utmost, 
he would have it in his power to exonerate himself of any further demand on this 
score: whereas had the penalty l^een no more than is, to which in this case he 
would hardly have given the denomination of a '* heavy** one — this single shil- 
ling being to have been recovered in a regular way, I for my part would not be 
the floaa to save him harmless for ten times .the maanmum of lol, — no, nor for 
agood deal more. 

"What wiiU be amusing enough — and, to any man in whose bosom the inte^ 
rests of mankind are wont to excite any warmer sympathy than the interest'of 
Judge and. Co^, consolatory, is — to observe the two traps set for the ualearned 
men, one by each oC these his two learned advisers, and his unlearned good sense 
saving him from both. 

To make ** appBcation to the Court,** viz. in the only proper maimer (learned 
gentleman fee'd and so forth) hat without miy ground for it, is the learned ad<^ 
vice given from the Temple, 

To get himself indicted or injormed against before Lord Ellenborough — (mark 
well before Lord EffenboTough] — indicted for an attempt to commit a refortn^ . 
m, by cutting up the most vali^able branch of the packing tradt^indicted, and 
this with at least a plausible ground, say rather a good gronnd to build a convic^ 
tion upon. 

After all this Iea,rned advice, including the pre-etninendy learned hint not to 
risk his reputation for << discretion,** by any such attempt as that of '< makiq|« 
<< us better th^ well" the unlearned person took a course which assuredly 
would not have been advised by any of the three, and laid bare the whole mat- 
ter to the public eye. 

And here we see matter^iotonly of satisfaction, in respect of the escape made 
by the UrdUook the snares set for hfm by both fowlers, but of gratitude for the 
instructive song in which he has sung of it.

by the fees payable for their serving oh Special Juries : 
/ know several of this description \<rho are ludicrously 
described as being deeply concerned and interested in the 
** Guinea Trade* and a diligent scrutiiig^ with the assistance 
•* of the returning officers, might lead to this reform. 

Ing td independence. — Solicit and solicit, till you have succeeded in getting into 
a situation of profit, out of which, without a moment's warning, for any thing 
or for nothing, you may be let drop at any dme, without possibility of com- 
plaint and without knowing why or wherefore. 

- What minister, or other man in power, is there, who, on the part of all isorts 
of men, whose functions are said and supposed to act as checks to his own, 
-would not be content to see " independence" not only thus ** f^d^ to" but, if 
after such an addition there could be any thing more to add to it, thus rendered 
complete ? — A system of this sort would be not le^ efficient (and how much 
more decent would it not be ?) than the giving licence by act of parliament, to 
tSa contracts whereby a member sells himself to a minister— licence and protec- 
tion, on condition that the terms employed in them shall not be << express" — 
(See the Perceval Parliamflsitary Purity Act, 49 Geo. 3- c. 118. § 3.) 

• Deeply concerned and interested in the Guinea trade,'] Imprudence'-'Urea' 
chery — telling tales out of school — such are the reflections, whidi by a man, of 
more warmth and learning than candour or reflection, might be apt to be cast upon 
the disclosure thus made by our learned adviser. Against a load of imputation, 
which, though to a first glance not altogether without colour, will on an impar- 
tial examination be seen to be iK)t more serious than groundless, it would be un- 
generous at least, if not unjust, to leave him altogether without defence. If of the * 
appellation (Guinea-man) and of the habits and dispositions which it imports, the 
existence were really notorious-^-notorious in any such degree as that in VThich he 
understood them so to be— on this supposition, to have kept them from the know- 
ledge of a Sheriff, and especially so active and inquisitive a Sheriff, and one to 
whom, in less than a twelvemonth, the number of applications made for 
lituations in this very corps amounted to above a hundred, (Phillips, p, I73jt 
would have been altogether hopeless: while, by the frankness of the communi- 
cation, all suspicion of wishing to throw a veil over the pracdoe was, in the 
most promising at least, if not altogether efiectual manner, obviated. 
' Between Judges, Master Packers, and Guinea-men, all suspicion of any thing 
like an understanding was, in this refined and indirect way, much more ^fllec- 
tually repelled,' than it could have been by any direct arguments: since, of any 
•uch arguments, the effect would have been, in the first place, to bring forward 
an idea, which could not be too carefully kept out of sight : viz, the idea of a state 
of things, the existence of which would if once made matter of argument, be 
much more likely to be confirmed by it than disproved. 

Against r^arm in every line, it begins to be discovered^ that much more ef- 
fectual war may sometimes be carried on by adoption, than by open opposition. 
In a very high place, indeed, go almost when you will, you may hear the abuser 
of die law iu}t only acknowledged, but inveighed against: — Justus if any thing 
but wiU were wanting to the removal of them ;— just as if iif the whole world of 
]^w there were any one thing of which the learned orator had any tolerably clear 
conception, except the value of those same abuses ; — jri§ as if the most mis* 
^hievous of those abused were not the food on which miself, and his closest 
^oopections have growp so Ux ttpon^-*-just as if they were not dearer to hin 
than the ajpple d bis eye.

§ 2. The Letter with Annotations. 191 

" I do not,* under this last observation, mean to insinuate 
'* that even such characters acting upon oath are likely to do 
" wrong* or that they do not possess sufficient powers of 
*• discrimination to decide rightly \ but I think that the spe- 
•* cial jury fees should be received only in the way of compen" 
•* sation for actual expences and loss of time, and not as 
** matters of profit. t 



« Likely to do ivrong,] The faith of this learned person in the virtue of an 
oath is truly edifying. Unsanctified by this principle of sanctification, the 
probity of these Guinea traders does unquestionably not appear to have been set 
^y him at a very high rate: give them an oath to swallow, every impure. pro- 
perty is, by this consecrated vehicle, carried off. Note that the oath by which 
the swallower is rendered thus unlikely *' to do wrong" is the very oath, which, 
as often as any difference of opinion has place among the elect twelve, is regularly 
productive of perjury ; of perjury on the part of some portion of the number from 
one to eleven inclusive : I say of perjury ; unless it be supposed, that, by that 
terror of inevitable and insupportable torture by which the will is subdued, the 
understanding is enlightened and converted ; and that, of him whose power- of 
.endurance is the weakest, the conviction and conversion is regularly apd proppTf 
tionably the most sincere. An oath " preservative against corruption !*'— an 
oath composed of vague and unbinding generalities, such as those of which 
such effectual care has regularly been taken that it shall be composed ! 
- Alas!, by what fatality did so simple an expedient escape the piously scrupul- 
ous and learned mind, that has the royal conscience in its keeping~-so cheap a 
defence of nations against corruption — ^as the advising his Majesty to give to the 
department of the Commander in Chief the benefit of a pledge of purity, eop* 
respondent to that by which, in tlac judicial department, the di€EicuIty of " during 
*'' turon^' has been rendered thus extreme !— Tbe person whom you shall nominatf 
to an office witldn your department shall, in every instance, be, in every respect, 
the person the best qualified for the fUing of that office — So help you God, With 
such a security, the child in leading strings might have been trusted with a Q>m" 
mission as safiely as his &ther, and the wiles of Mrs. Clarke would have hid no 
more power over the virtue of the Commander in Chicf> than those of D^Hhk 
had over Samson before his hair was crdpt. 

f Not as matters of profit,] The severity of the learned gentleman's virtue 
has, upon this occasion, displayed itself in an opinion, which it is somewhat 
easier to admire than to understand. That a declaration, to the efiect id ques* 
tion, should be incorporated into the purity-securing oath. . . . ? is thiU what kt. 
means to recommend ? I A,B, (for example) do declare, that the guimeajtut r^, 
^ceived by me has been and is " received only in the way qf comperuatumjor actu^ 
" expences and loss of time, and not as a matter qf profit, SohelpmeOod!^ 
Or if duly construed and put into a tangible shape, would the propos^ security 
be found to amount, for example, to something to this effect? vn. thitona 
motion, reguUirly made by some learned gentleman, opposable or unopposable 
by learned gentlemen on the other side, a rule should, if the Court diink fit^ 
be with equal regularity made, ordering that an account be taken by the Masttr^ 
" of the actual expene^* incurred by each Special Juryman, vitt, m the $h£^ if 
chaise-hire, and subsistence tfpon the road, as also of the ** compenMiim due 
' '* to kirn for loss qf time ;*' with a direction to allow out of the guhea (being tte 
gresteit sttin aUowdd by the Act) m grtater #vm thm thaU. im lyfrtil l^ mmr 



19s Chap. VIIL Maxims concertdng Reform. 



CHAP. VIII. Maxims, concerning Reform, de- 
duced FROM THE ABOVE LeTTER. 

§ 1. The Maxims themselves. 

THE subject of Reform being at present on the carpet, 
and a variety of opinions afloat, a few maxims or aphorisms^ 
half a dozen or thereabouts, and containing the substante of 
so much of the above learned dissertation as regards that 
subject, may, perhaps, in these unsteady times, be found 
not altogether out 01 season. 

Lest the eye of the reader's mind should find itself in^ 
commoded by too strong a blaze of light bursting in upon 
it at once, to prepare it for the brilliancy of the mort grand 
tnd comprehensive principles, I place in front a rule or 
two confined in their extent to the only subject that belongs 
directly and necessarily to these pages — xnz. the institution 
of Special Juries. 

1. When, for the execution of a plan repugnant to the ac- 
ktkowledged principles of the constitution, and to tfie 
equally acknowledged injunctions of an act of pariia^nenc, 
48 persons have been selected, of whom, for the insuriil^ 
the success of that plan, 12, or upon occasion a single oiie, 
are in every indivtSual instance sufficient, the faculty of 
discarding 12 out of the ^8 will, if lodged in proper bsmds, 
be» in every such instance, sufficient (o defeat it. 

For (says the Liticoln's-Inn Letter) ** one circumstance 
** ... .must remove all suspicion on this subject : • • • .Spe- 
** cial Juries are struck under Mi drder of the Court only 
•• ... .so that it miist be the fault of the defendant's own 
^< soHciter, if he does not obtain a respectable list for the 
** trial of the issue." 

s. If, in ihe instance of a set of men of whom (ex- 
cept their being >n possession, each of tbein, of a portion 

mth** Mttmal expeneeif*' Ugetktr viA muk *^ due eomperuiUnn** as afirtsmd:-^ 
€$tt$ qf tkt ofpiicaikm to awai the Mastm's Meport. 

The kitter I gife as being mcie puticulariy in unison with the general spiric 
mtA tendcQCf of such amendments of the hCw as are to be found in the statute 
^OikV s°"^ *^ ^ suggestion, or in confonnlty to the adfidc, of the gentlemen 
••tl»lDii9iobe. Au as to 1^ opinion »i^<nrha<far,wlMrther it be in legal re- 
llgjWt, ashitefiMtcaie, orittlegsil^^meetc»,a»in thehntcase, that the tnitit 
t ti !• l^sought fior itb iwis^be kft for titt fiadier to dctdipui^

ftofcrif which may be insufficient for tkt maintenance of 
aiiy one oi them) nothing tooFe is known than that they 
are, all pf them, pensioners during pleastiite under the aii* 
thority 9n whieh th^rs was intended and is said to serve as 
a cheek--4{, in the instance of a set of p^ty placeai^n so 
arc^mstapoedt there be any cause of apprehension, lest» 
en any occasion, they should manifest, as towards that au- 
thority,, d degree of obsequiousness inconsistent with pro- 
bity and independence— i-in such imaginary case, a sort o£ 
sanction which, as often as any real difference of opinion 
has had and continues to have place among them, is trodden 
under foot, would as against such danger, or cause of ap- 
prehension, afibrd a sunupient security. - 

For •• I do not" (says our leafiied adviser) ** mean to insi- 
*' nuate, that even, such characters^ acHng utoon oatk^ are 
••likely to do wrong:** ** such characters^ viz. fersom 
who, by this same learned gentleman /have just been de« 
scribed as ** persons who from low situations in life, have 
** crept into a little independence, and by artifice and c^^tf* 
** si§n with the inferior cmicers, get their names placed upon 
•' the freeholders* list, with a view principally to their add- 
•* ing to that independence by the fees payable for their 
** serving on special juries. ** 

3. If, i4|the whole expanse of the all-perfect system, it 
'were possible that a particle of imperfection should anv- 
where be found, the imputation, in so far as it were just, 
would fall — no part of it on the most powerful, every part 
of it on the least powerful of all the classes that could be 
found! concerned in it : no part of it upon those under 
whose eye, and by whose authority, every thing is done 
that is done, every part of it on those whose dependence cm 
that authority is complete and absolute. 

Accordingly, in the instance of the only reform^ which 
is represented as lying within thtpiwet^ of^the only person, 
in whose instsfnce any inclination to that effect has been per-* 
ceptible, the •• r^ornC* suggested consists in the»" expunging 
*• iht names (^ all such persons who from low situations in lyk 
•' have crept into a kttte independence:'* — Thus far the sug- 
gestion oi the learned reformer: 16t the due understanding 
of which it is necessary to be considered, that the con- 
sequence would be ^nothing less b^ing sufficient to insure 
its continuance) that if in numbers sufficient for the pur- 
pose, persons sufficiently adapted to |he purpose were not

found remaining, other persons of the necessary consM 
plexion, and in sufficient number, would of course be 
udLen in to fill up the gap. 

^ 4. Every man: — sonebe Ai^A enough^s a proper — and 
. except others seated on the sanle level, and linked with him 
in the bands of the same interest, tht ardy proper^udge 
in his own cause* 

Accordingly, as we have seen^ *• it is the proper province 
"of ihe Court above^** fiays our learned reformer who 
/dates from Lincoln's-Inn) " to interfere and introdtuc a 
•* r^orm*^ 

j. Th.e hands by whose industry abuse has been created--^ 
by whose steadiness it has been prestroed^^^nA by which, 
wheibcr created or only preserved by them, the projit has 
been, and continues to be, reaped — these are the bands at 
which the extirpation oi it is to be sought. 

6. When, for example, as long as he has been sitting on 

his bench, a Judge has been in the habit of treading under 

. foot, with open eyes, the authovity of Parliament, the Judges 

himself is the proper authority to apply to, if you would 

have him cease doing so; Parliament, net. 

For the letter, in which the Lord Chief Baron's determr- 
nation to persevere in that same habit had been deliberately 
•declared, makes one of *' the three Utters mthjk^ perusal of 
^* which'' (says this learned gentleman to ihe SMriff) ^^ ^on 
•• have favoured me.'* 



^ 2. Corroborations from Lord BldorCs Scotch Reform. 

Such are the articles^ which, in substance and effect, 

though not in words (for words are ever under the command 

of existing circumstances) constitute, so far as the most pro- 

.bable interpr-etation^ or as lawyers say construction^ which I 

•have been able to find for the learned words in question 

•may be found tO be correct, part and parcel of this our 

lawyers creed. 

I might have said the lawyer's, creed : for, as already imi- 
matedf with here and there a possible exception, too rare at 
any rate to be to such a purpose worth noticing, being all 
bred in the same learned school, all cast in the same learned 
mouldy whoever ht^% one learned gentleman . sees o//^ nor 



$ 8. Cofrdhoration^ froth Lordl^don^s Sicatih Reform, tgg 

tift these articles of the number of those* which^ to obtaia 
acceptance atid adherence, require signature. 

Thus mucTi must be confessed — viz. that as yet it is only, 
in so far as the individual learned mind in question can» 
Vith propriety, be deemed and taken as and for a fair sam- 
ple oi the genus, that the propositions in question can ift 
their herein alledged character of articles of the lawyer's 
creed, be with propriety received as genuine^ 
• In that same character^ as far as concerns reform of law* 
abuses, can the genuineness of these articles find any man 
still sceptically enough disposed to doubt of it? Let him 
turn to the list of Commissioners for the Reform of Scottish 
Judicature. (See Report of their proceedings as printed 
for the use of the House of Commons, in pursuance of an 
order dated June 9, 1809.) Let him see with what i^eligi. 
ous care the name of every person is shut out, on whoso 
part any the least desire to see defalcated any the least 

{article of abuse from a System composed wholly of abuse, 
ad ever been perceptible ; while those of the maintainers 
and defenders of the whole system are with correspondent 
carefulness collected and inserted. 

Taking, for the basis of his calculation, the number of 
two-^nd-mrtf rtapers^ let him admire and calculate how 
rich a kari^ of reward is destined to be reaped by learned 
industry, occupied in the field of reform, in the accustomed 
course of learned husbandry. 

From what they have done already let him calculate what 
they are about to do. Let him pray— -if haply into his re* 
ligion be admitted any particle of regard for the welfare of 
the people, and the ends of justice— let him pray^ that the 
ministers of such justice may, in the sense most beneficial 
to the country, be prevented in all their doings; that what 
has been begun in doubts may be continued and ended in 
the same; and that of these doubts, the distribution of the 
matter of reward throughout the mass of learned merit, 
ma^, as being to the country the least bitter, be the only 
frujt. ^ 

Let him' behold in idea, and, if so it please him, in Mack 
and white, a judicatory^* in which a business occupies as 
many years as, in another sitting by the side of it,t the same 
business would occupy hours or perhaps minutes, and these- 
learned persons ndt hesitating to attach their signatures

of Marmion does not add that of calling up the Zd^ Earl, ia

After reading, as above, the history of the appointnienl

predicted (as any man may do without the gift of prophesy} 
■wtiai wiU be done, let him give thanks, that no one of 
M^napa/f.teU Dnkes is as yet known to have been invited 
over to replace ihe Duke of York: and that if, by that noble 
and learned oracle of the cabinet, advice to any such effect 
ha^ ever really been given, doubts, of the nature of those 
clouds, which never cease to exhale from the same ever* 
pregnant source, continue for the present to hang over it. 

Accordingly amongst similar articles of information fur^

put o^ with a figure of speech ; a sarcasm some might cat) 
It, others an oxymor an ^ rmdc at any rate out of an Italian 
epigram in the shape of aq epitaph^ and. that so old as to 
have grown stale : — instead of the jifjA prayed for, a serpent 
given, and with a sting too in the tali of it, though perhaps 
not a very sharp one* 

Let us now follow him to the packing office. 

Whether it lyas that the advice couched in the epi- 
gram had not as yet been received, or, having been re- 
ceived, the eloquence of it had failed of producing the ef- 
fect it looked for, so it was that our Quixote Sheriff took 
the irregular course of doing ** better tkan welL** Besides 
the blame — for such it appeared to him-r-of acting in the 
, teeth, not only of a principle of the constitution, but of an 
4ct of parliament, he saw, or thought he saw, a penalty of 
5/. for every transgression, impending over his bead.— 
Raw and uninstructed as he was in the practice of Courts ^ 
}ed astray by a propensity to innovation, speculation, and 
the false philosophy of the times, a conceit possessed hini 
that the tide of corruption ought rather to be stemmed than 
iswum with, and that acts of the legislature were designed 
tather to be obeyed than to be contemned. Misled by 
theories. Parliament, to his fancy, presented i^elf as supe- 
rior to Judges. It was not long betore his error stared him 
in the (ace. 

Under such impressions it must h?fye been that, on a cer« 
tain day to this compiler unknown,^ our Knight presented 

■ 

* Ona ceftam day to ^ compiler unknown,} Unfortunately as to this point 
the original memoirs h^Ye left us — in tht dtaA: at least, if not |n the darif;.— Th9| 
the visit of the Sheriff to the Remembrancer's office was antecedent to the daip 
ef his abov64nention!bd letter t6 the Lord Chief Baron, seems probable: for, 
though we are not expressly informed of its being so, yet as the mention made 
of it is antecedent to that made of the letter, such, in de&ult of more positive 
information, it seems -natural to conchicke ynm the order of the facts. A circum- 
stance indeed by which the force of the inference mty perhaps be thought to be 
somewhat lessened, is—that almost immediately after comes an incident stated 
«s subsequent to the month of July, whereas it was the month of April 'tlK|^ 
closed j as well as opened, that epistolary corresjpondence. But the former hypo- 
thesis may perhaps be found to receive confirmation from another circumstance: 
viz. the symptoms of pliancywhichf it will immediately be seen, were produced 
by, and at the tinle of that visit— I mean the pliancy of that moment, when 
compared with the restored rigidity <rf later times. 

Before the result of the epistolary application made to the ^pcrior waskfiowny 
the personal application would hardly have been made to the subordinate;' Now^ 
in this interval, there was ample time for the communication that would natii^ 
nlly be nutde of ,tbe natter from the superior to the suboidiaate: •a4i if ^^

liimself at the busiest of the two Exchequer packing offices' 
— the office of the Deputy Remembrancer — with the free- 
kolders' book in his pocket: " having previously provided 
•* himself with a list of persons who had served . . . .within- 
•* two terms:" viz. in the hope of preventing, if pracrica- 
ble, their serving again, till the time should come at which 
their service would not be an infringement of the prohibi- 
tion certainly pronounced by justice, and supposed to be 
pronounced by law. ^ 

Conceive who can, the surprize of Mr. Deputy Remern^ 
irancer^ when, the figure of the Sheriff appearing before- 
him — and, with the list of over-served Guinea-men in on& - 
hand, and the Act of Parliament, instead of a pistol, in the- " 
other, advancing upon him— 4ie heard himself called upon, 
contrary to all precedent, to' pay obedience to the law. This 
was rank innovation : this was plain jacobinism. Mean- 
time what was to be done? The Sheriff with his instrument 
of terror was present: the reverend Ju^ge, with his instni-' 
ment of support, his Italian tombstone, was not present.— « 
Our Felix trembled. — ^The existeirce of the law was recog- 
nized, its application admitted, its authority submitted to ;- 
submitted to for the moment, though even then not altoge-' 
ther without wry faces. During the continuance of the 




-though only 

to a certain extent — influenced by this principle. Of the 
poci^ets which, cause after cause^ and " term yter term'' had 
been used to come andf load themselves with guineas, some, 
though some oiv)y were for the moment kept at home, kept 
at home for awhile to empty themselves, and make room 
for others : others made, of course, as nearly as they cquI4 
be found, of the same ipaterials, and of the same cut.* 

Obsequiousness having thus beei) producpdr-)[^ut \x\ 9 
quarter, and in a 'direction, very different from that in which 

such communication had been made, the compliance, th« wwDxlUsnpitit of 
which seems pretty conctusiTely evidenced by the subsequent rigidity, would 
l^dly have taken place.

l>y law fl mean by tbe judicial makers of law) it bad been 
intended, and been accustomed to be produced — a natural 
c^ject of curiosity will be to know what length of time so 
extraordinary a phsenomenon continued to have place. 

The obsequiousness — the compliance continued just so 
long as the force, by which it had been produced, vtz. the 
ynistrument of terror above-mentioned, continued to be ap«- 
plied. The acting force being removed, re^ctiw regained 
the ascendant. Th* .pliancy lasted but for tifO Jiirwings: 
the principle of elusiidiy displayed itself, rigidiiy succecided, 
iand regularity^ (I mean what in Westminster-hail is meant 
%y regularity^ viz. regular disobedience to law) was ret 
ftored.* 

The cause of this return to regularity and sociiil order, 
lies at no great depth. Though, between the titular Re's, 
membrancer of the Exchequer, and his Deputy, there exists* 
unless by accidenti no more connection than betwcien the 
cinoluments of his .^incipal and the duty o^ pretencf^ of 
whtch the emojumems are received, between the pre-emi- 
nently learned Chief of that judicatory, and his subordinate 
the aroresaid Deputy, the intercoufae is nepeasarify close 
andiAlimate.^

Of two things one. Either in this office an -^ct oF Par- 
liament is felt ip the character of a binding force, acting as 
a bridle upon private inclinations, or it is nfii: if it Ar, the 
consequence is — ^its ; forcp having, in the present instance, 
jjroved uttimalely inefficient— -some external force must have 
been employed in over-powering it; and if so, we see, 
without much danger of error, what that force was; but if 
not — if in that office an Act of parliament is really hot felt 
hi the character of a binding force, what in that office is the 
atate of justice? 

* " I have since learnt however," (continues Sir Ridiard from the pi^sag^ 
last quoted) *' that no iegud is paid to die pIbTisions of this claoae, ahd that 
^ the Juries are tUU:* (on the 20th of September 1808, the iday on ^YAdb hH

^2. Instruction gained'^Defittttions and Maxims* fioi 

In that 2^ctf— thence (might have been added) in thq 
Court under which it acts — thence again — in the other Coujts 
III the view of which it acts: — but of this elsewhere. 

Upon the whole, bench and ojffice togtther^-^doctrine and 
practice together— doctrine leading practice, practice ex- 
pounding doctrine — we may obtain — ^if not exactly that sort 
of instruction ^nd satisfaction^ which an unlearned eye, un« 
versed in the practice of Courts, might be apt to look for— t 
at any rate a definition : a definition, which having for its 
subject a word of no scanty extent^ and, (relation being had 
jto its extent, and the application given of it) of no Tnean 
importance, presents some claim to notice. 

Well, considered as a quality of action — in any such phrase 
for example as acting well — is a relative term, involving ia 
its import an implied reference to the situation of the person 
whose agency is considered. 

On the part of a Chief Judge, notice having been re- 
ceived by him of an Act of Parliament prohibiting a certain 
practice, and the application of the Act to that practice hav- 
ing been deliberately admitted, acting well consists in dc'^ 
fending the practice in black and white, and, after a mo- 
mentary interruption, produced in another subordinate 
station by present urgency, causing it, or at least delibc'* 
Toiely suffering it, to be resumed and continued as before. 

On the part of a Deputy J^membrancer, — an oflScer occu- 
pying an office subordinate to that of the Chief Judge-^ 
acting well consists in acting, under the direction of the 
Judge, in the maintenance and support of such supposed, 
prohibited and illegal practice, and, after notice and recog- 
nition of the illegality, and a momentary stop put to the 
practice, resuming it, and with it the habit ot considering 
the authority of a Judge as superior to that of the l€;gisla- 
iture. • 

As to better than well, in the unanimous opinion of all the 
commentators, the use of the phrase is a flower of rhetoric 
••—a figure of speech— some might call it oxymoron'-^oihtTS^ 
irony: the opinion iniended to be inculcated being the re- 
verse or nearly so, of the meaning which on the face of the 
literal sense stands expressed. lU is the meaning really in* 
tended to be inculcated; so that, upon the whole, the doc* 
trine, meant in and by the epistle m question to be incul- 
cated, may be comprized in two short and well-matched 
aphorisms or maxims : — he acts well^ who violates the law : 
he acts Hi, who either obeys it himself, or caUs upop others 
to obey it, ,

Packing and Cutting. 

§ » 1 . Abusts touched upon^^Packing and Cutting. 

X HE 24th of April, 1809, fonns a new era in the. 
history of this art. 

Of the state of this branch of business, a corner is noW, 
unrolled before St. Stephen : the eyes of the Saint, as ii^ 
these cases must sometimes happen, especially if the cry be' 
loud and troublesome, half open themselves to the abuse: 
but then immediately, as usual; close upon it. 

Up stands Mr, JVhitbread^ and more or less light is 
thrown upon parts or supposed parts of judicial ^ prac« 
tice. 

1. Package of Jurors^ viz. in the offices which we have 
seen established for that purpose. 

2. Bribery of Do. doubled: double guineas substituted to^ 
single ones. 

n' Q. Unobsequious Jurors dropped: or, in the fashionable 
and familiar phrase, cz^.

A« 



On this occasion, amidaiAe iiafifliin inties to which News- 
paper-reporting is liable, one thing seems pretty clear, viz. 
that, in respect of depth and extent, the nature of the ntis- 
chief Vas tqii^toticcmd •'*-->xiis<^lsceived and under, rated, 
by the Honourable Gentleman, bv whose public spirit the 
matter was thus brought ior-wara. "That the Master of 
** the Crown Office should have in Tiis discretion the nomi- 
*• nation of juries,'* — this is what to him appeared— s^s well 
jt m^^fat kppear— ^' a great ferdshtp." Ot the state of thitigs 
thus spoken of, the description thus given -is thus far cpr. 
rect. But when the mode, in whiqh the effect is brought 
about, ' comes to be spoken of, there it is tbitt the deiicrfption 
fails. ** Of the persons summoned on the pannel^ sucK 
^/ mmespassed over as he thinks fit, without calling thorn on 
"^ thcitJineSf upon' the mere plea that they could ngt attend^ 
. and retaining such names u he thought fit • . . ."*— Tq. ap« 
ply a detailed correction to the several mistakes contained m. 
this, part of the statement, would, after what has been saidt 
tp'the two former jpafts of thi^ work, be a useless /pperatk)];! l^ 
tlie general result is clear enough: viz*, that it is by a frau* 
4ulent contrivance, and that such a one as requires t9|l)e 
renewed on <eacl^ individual occasion — by irregular practice, 
111 Traud of the law,' and not byxffae law itself, as constituted 
\y the avowed and regular practice of Judges — that the 
^ nominations^ and' nullification, of these supposed and pre- 
^ded checks upon the desj^tism of Judbes is effected. 

Of these errors the origin appears sufficiently phvious, 
Tihough in several, points not conformable to the view. given 
pf the case by Sir Richard Phillips, there remains confer-* 
j»ity enough to render it probable, tliat it is from hi^ repre-' 
Mentation of the matter, as given in his book, that that of 

♦ Words of the Report of that pact of M^ • Whi thread's speech, as given in the 
Jlm« Kempaper,.of IheaSlh of April igo©-*" He thought it, for instatice, 9 
** gieat hardship, that the Master of the Ciown Office sliould have in his discre- 
^'tani the adn^tioii of JnhBs, by passing over (he Jiames of such peraom 

V aiuamonfid <>n the pannd as he thooght fit, without calling them on ihfif 

V fiiitts, uj^en the mere plea ,that they could not attend, and returniifit^fuctt 
^ ttSun^ aiie tlK>ught fit.** 



§ A« Backing. %^ 

ihe Honourable Gentleman was taken. I mean th£> *^p€s$^ 
*' iag over'* — ^and '' tipon the mere flea that they cotUd nai 
** 4tfoid("-<-and 10 forth. By this the conception cpnveyed 
^we seej is*-that, taken in its totality, the Gross list oo^ei 
into the Master's hands from some oiM^r quarter: and that 
all that it i^ in tns power to do isr^to cause to be JiscarJed 
out of it this or that individual; and that even that cannot 
be done in any case, without ajresh as well siijalse pre- 
tence } whereas, as we have seen over and over again, the 
truth is-^hat of the persons whose names are put upon this 
Gross List, every individual without exception i& constantly 
and r^gtUarly chosen by him,, and that if, for ridding it of 
this or that obnoiious individual, any such pretence Miaold 
happen to be aece&saryi it is not hy himf by that ofliofr, 
who in regular course nominates whom he pleases, that anjr 
a^ch fals^ood need be, or indeed could consistently bft 
averred. 

As to &V Richard Phillips ^ happily for the public be nev 
ther was, nor ever had been, a lawyer: on tbe parttcukir 
occasion in question, he plunged not-^^-'tijne would not have 
suffered him to have plunged---into any such foetid mass q£ 
4lead letter, as the labyrinth composed of tbe iooAs of pracr 
iice. He did-^^what in . his place every non«lawyer would 
have, felt the necessitv of doing — he betook himself to the 
lixnng oracles of the taw, such as were within his reach •? 
and what their responses were has been -seen in another 
place : the point here in question is of the number of those 
which may there be seen involved by them in some of tbeir 
gilded clouds. ' 

To what purpose these two paragraphs ? To serve as » 
critique upon a Newspaper ?-— No : but to shew that the 
real complection of the ulcer is far more angry^^ than that 
which it then presented to the eye of the Honourable Gen- 
tleman : that tbe real depth of it had ngt then been sounded 
by him: and that it continues to call, and with ixKresised 
energy, for the renewed and more serious exertions of hijt 
healings but in the first place of his probing, hand. 

Had it not been for irregularities, as we have seen-— some 
but supposed, others, as we shall see, real-Hthe subject, m 
far as upon the face of this report it appears would never 
have received a visit from those experienced eyes, wfitch 
reflect so much useful light on every subject on which they 
fix. For this, wherever law is concerned, is the general 
error : ascribing whatever is amiss— not to regular pracucti

fto6 Chap. I. Commons* Debaie^ £4 Apnt^ i8oj|« 

but to irregularities: not to the system^ but to A. or B« id 
whom on this or that occasion, it happens to be acting under 
St. This is the grand error of errors-«>supposing regular 
"practice to have had not only justice^ but justice alone, foi; 
Its object: whereas it never has had justice for any part of 
its object, n»r, in the nature of men and things, circum* 
stanced as Judges have been, ever could have had. 



§ 3. . Cutting. 

On the subject of cutting and being cut^ up rises Mr. 
Marryaty and speaks of one person, viz. himself, to whom 
after verdicts given against the Crown, no such acciden 
had happ^nvd : and there the evidence, or at least the report, 
as above, given of it, stops.* But, stopping there, it proves 
nothing. It has already been stated, (Part I. Chap^ 4. ^ 6.J 
that verdicts after verdicts may be given aeainst the Crown, 
and to every officer that ever calls himself the Crown^ the 
event of the cause be, personally speaking, a matter of in«> 
difference. On a question of revenue, where is the Chan- 
cellor of the £xchequer-^where is the Solicitor of the 
Treasury, Customs, Excise, Stamps, Assessed Taxes, or any 
other Board, who, any more than the Honourable Geotle* 
man himself, would wish for a verdict against evidelice ? 

Up already had arisen Mr, Attorn^. General: and here, in 
the person of this great Law Omcer, may be se6n the 
prudence of the serpent hiding itself under the simplicity of 
the dove. '* Witn respect to the partial summoning of 
*' Jurors, as he himselt did not summon them, he would 
•• not" (says the Report) •* undertake to say any thing of the 
*• fact from his own knowledge." As to summoning, that 
roust have been the mistake of the Reporter: summoning 
could never have been the word of the Great Law Officer. 
As to Great Law Officers, what may happen to their science 
is — as to mere matters of fact, to put on the mask of igna^ 

« Mr, Whithready as per 7zm«£.— *' Another practice he understood to prevail 
•« was-^hat Special Jurfitien, who had been summoned over and oyer again, if 
.*< ever they found a verdict against the Crown, it some how or other happened, 
«• they were never aummoned afterwards." 

Mr. Marryat as per Do.— '< He was frequently in the habit of being sum- 
** moned as a Special Juror. He had frequently found verdicts as ¥FeU against 
^* the Cfowti as (or the Crown, and he never experienced any dificitucc oil that ^ 
•«< account." 



§.3. Cuitingt / tcr; 

mnci: whsit never happens to it, is— to misapply law words. 
Nominating is the word^ as well as the pracUce^ here : and 
to the Great Law Officer in question most assuredly it never 
had happened to nowinaie^ any more than sunMian^ a single 
Juror m the whole course ot his life. But, of the seven 
offices belonging to the three Courts, there is not one but 
what has its officer, (already designated so often by the 
name of the Master Packer) by whom this nominati6n; as 
so often mentioned, is regularly and avowedly performed : 
nor is there more than one, if so much as one there be, that 
has not its bovk ox books of practice^ in which this nondna* 
tion is regularly mentioned as being so performed. 

If the practice of the Courts in which they practise, and 
the Books in which that practice is delineated, be to such a 
degree a stcrei to Great Law Officers^ can it be wondered 
that they should be e(}ually so to lay-gents^ such as Sheriffs 
and Members of Parliament ? 

So much for ignorance: the quality of the person consi« 
dered, I should have said nescience: nescience, the cause at 
accompaniment of so amiable a quality as simplicity. We 
come now to confidence^ the result znd Jruit of u, 

'* But he was confident'* (continues the Reporter) ** that 
" any officer of the Court, who would vemure on such a 
" practice, would certainly lose his ^/ace.'*^— Thus far the ' 
Great Law Officer. 

For my part, the confidence of which my ignorance has 
been productive, is as strong as his can possibly have been s 
it is, however, of a nature exactly opposite. In each of. 
the seven offices there is but one officer, by whom (unless it 
be, as we have seen, by his Deputy ,-^(See Part I. Chap* 
8. p. 8i.) Jurors zx^ nominated \'^(l should have said or 
are supposed to be nominated: J and he, (as we have seen) is 



forany«uch practice as the practice, here, though impro- 
perly, designated under the name of ** a partial summoning** 
— say partial nomination-^oi Jurors, could, by any possiii'^ 
bty^ be made to •* lose his place.'* The nature of the case 
does not admit of it : the verv nature of the case— -unless 
any such odd accident should happen to the officer as that 
of having an Italian epigram, ready cocked, which be wants 
to bringdown a reformer with — ^the very nature of the case, 
as we have seen, excludes all evidencc.^^-'Stilesy Esquire^ im

§ 1. Ground and Embroidery explained. 

THE dist;inction requires explanation; and explanation 
shall be given to it. 

Double-fee abuse plain — (or, as but for the apparent con* 
tfadictioi^, it might have been called, simfle'j'^rtiere waste 
of public money — nothing worse. 

Embroidery to the abuse, corruption of Jurors, and c^- 
igmpt of Parliament :— in a particular case, the wasted money, 
the second of two guineas, receiving so particular an appll* 
cation as to operate, in the character of a portion of the 
matter of , corruption, upon a certain clas^ of Jurors : and 
this in defiance of an Act of Parliament, tnz. of. a clause 
(^4 Geo. 2. c, i8. ^ 2.) made for the express purpose of 
fixing Uf)on one guinea — and that not as the regular tee, but 
as the Very greatest fee, that, by Jurors of that descriptio^n, 
Aall, in any case, be received.* 

* Simpk dissipation abuse. Mr. Whitbread, as per Tin«9. '* Anotfaer prac- 
*' tice he understood to be uniform with Courts; namely, that tlie Crown always 
** paid to the Officers double-fees." 

Cbmipt and contemptuous abuse. Do. as per Do. '' Further he was informed 
** that where a Special Jury found a verdict for the Crown, it was usual to piqr 
*' each man two guineas ; where the verdict was against the Crown, they re- 
*' ceived but one guinea per man.*' 

The contempt consists in the violation of a clause limiting the fee to a guinea 
in all cases: of which clause some bow or other, in the speech, ho mention ap* 
ftlBLn t6 !»*« been made.

From the several Crown Solicitors, attached to the several 
Boards, dpuble-fees to the Law Officers : viz^ to the officers 
4n the several offices belonging to the several Courts of Jus- 
•tifce which they have to deal with : — Judges, in their own 
persons, included or not included; in the persons of their 
officers, whose fees they pocket, or derive a profit from in 
other shapes, included beyond doubt. And here we see the 
^plain and simple abuse. 

From the same hands, to each special juryman where the 
verdict in which he has concurred has been in favour of the 
. Crown, in extra guinea : wjiere it has been in favour of the 
party, no more than the one guxntzi the -extra guinea being 
given in the teeth of the Act v/hxch forbids the'giving more 
than one t and here we see, combitied in one nth mats of 
embroidery* iht corruptiom^^Wti to Jurors, and the con- 
tUnpt put upon Parliament, 



§ 2. Double-fee Abuse, plain: — mere Waste. 

But for the embroidery of which it forms the ground^ 
and for the explanation of which the mention of it is neces- 
sary, the plain abuse, the mere wa4ite of public money — 
would scarce be deemed worth a word or a thought any 
wkqfe: nor indeed would it be in its place here. 

As to our Great Law Officer, whom we shall presently 
behold breaking out into a burst of '* virtuous indignation, 
rising even to abhorrence,** he had none to spare for a prac* 
-tice so excusable, or rather so meritorious, as that of apply, 
ing double fees in the shape of rewards of merit, to merit 
personifiea in the persons of Law Officers. To these Law 
Officers ; officers, the profits of whose offices find their way 
in so ani^le a proportion into the pockets of noble and 
■teamed tenants for tife, whose remainder men are Great Law 
Officers. To this charge we ha\'€ nothing but his silence; 
nor need any thing more be desired considering the admis- 
.$ion it involves. 

Thus much then is establislied : triz. that it is become re^ 
gular practice, for the Lords of the Treasury in every cause 

" who tries the Issue or Issues shaU think just and reasonable, not cxceediog th€ 
. " sum of one pound one shilling. ..." Thus saith the law. 

JV; B. In practice the Judge never " thinks'* any thing about the matter. The 

irtmost sum thus allowed to be given in any case being as of course given m 
. every tase» he is nevtr Called upon to think about it.

instituted by a Crown Solicitor under their direction, to 
give out of the taxes to every Law Officer twice as much. 
as according to a rate settled by those whose interest it wa< 
to raise it as high as possible — twice as much as, even to an 
estimate thus. exaggerated, his services are worth: including; 
in every instance of an office executed by Deputy, the no- 
vice ot the principal, by whom the rewaid is poclLeted; 
without the expence of service. * • * ^ 

A list of the law offices and law officers thus remuncS 
jrated would, in one way or other, be instructive. 

The admission might have been as express as words, could 
make it, for any thing that any body could have had to 
fear from it. 

When ^tax has been called a tax^ John Bull has^now and 
then been heard to grumble. Call the tax 2Ljee,. he is satis- 
fied : so as the contribution be but imposed by the men by 
whom it is pocketed, pocketed by the men by whom it is 
imposed, Blackstone^s motto \s John BuWs — ''^ every thing is 
•• as it should be.'* But, if the imposers are Judges, and 
the persons on whom it is imposed are those children of af- 
fliction called JwzV^rj— patients with emptiness in their 
pockets, and perpetual blisters on their mind — then ,it is 
that he is not barely contented, he is delighted: (he cries) 
litigation is checked: some men not being able, others not 
willing, to' see, that in this way, wherever there exists a 
man, rich as well as wicked enough to purchase the power 
of oppression thus offered hira for sale, it is only the honest 
and injured litigant, or he who, if the ability were left him, 
would be litigant, that is thus checked, and that the dishonest 
litigant is instigated, supported, armed, by this most mis- 
chievous of all taxes ; every fee exacted from the other side 
being an instrument of oppression put into his hands. 



^ 3. Embroidery — Corruption of Jurors^ contempt of 

Parliament. 

We now come to the abuse in which the indignation of 
the Great Law Officer saw its proper and safe mark: an 
abuse of former times, supposed to have vanished with the 
times. 

•• Further" (says the Report, speaking of Mr, Whitbread) 
—'•further he was informed that when a Specia \niy 
** found 4 verdict y^r the' Crown, it was usual to pay each

** man two guineas ; where their verdict was against the 
•* Crows, they received but one guinea per man." Here 
we see the charge.^ Come wc now to the Great Lav Officer, 
and bis answer. 

♦• Mr. Auorney-Gcneral" (says the Report) •* in reference 
*^ to Mr, Whitbread's assertion, respecting the two guinea* 
^* given to Special ^Jurymen in cases of verdict against the' 
•* Crown. . . . [and the usage of discontinuing to summoii 
** Special Jurors who should once give a verdict against the 
** Crown] utterly denied the existence of such practices in* 
" any of the Courts within his memory." 

So far the Great Law Ofllcer. As to the passage included 
in brackets, it is thus distinguished, on the presumption that^ 
so far as concerns this practice, the supposition of an utter 
denial mustf for the reasons already given, (Chap. I. { 3.} 
have been a mistake. 

** He believer indeed" (continues the Report) " the 
*• former practice did sometimes take place, many years 
•^ since, in the Court of Exchequer; but had never ocr 
•• currcd for a great number of years, and it was a practice 
** which he abhorred, as disgraceiul to the administration of 
••justice.*' 

And so there was really a time u^hen corruption in thi^ 
shape was in use? And this Corruption appliea to. the very 
class of persons— to the very class of Jurors — which there 
has been such abundant occasion here to speak of r the very 
Jurors, CONCERNED, ** deeply concerned" in '* the Guinea 
trade V* And the corruption had not, as in the case of double 
fees to law officers (meaning, we may presume, all the law 
officers, without distinction, and upon all occasions) the 
praise of regtdarity for a cover to it ? No :« — it was given ta 
them or kept back from them, accoiding as they had be- 
haved ^ — according as they had or had not earned it. 

As to the Court, in which this *' abhorred" and ** disgrace^ 
••,ful practice'* was so recently in use, it is the Court of Ex- 
chequer: — that very Court, in which, in the opinion of the 
pre-eminently learned Manager himself, things go on (as we 
have seen) so well — so ** weW — that the idea of making them 
go On " better** is treated by him as something worse th^K 
||tedless» It is the very Court, in which recruits for this 
service are received and trained, and their •• characters," if 
not put on record, had in ** remembrance^ at least* i[or other 
servicers. 

And this practice, thus •• abhorred^' by Ae Atto;i>cy-Gc^ 



^ 3. C^rupthn of Jurars, contempt ofPartiatnent. 213 

^leral as •• disgraceful to the administration of justice," how 
catne it in the Court of Exchequer, or in any Court, call- 
ing itself a Court of Justice, ever, and so recently too, to 
have.placo? and supposing it not to have place to-day, is 
-there any thing artd what, to prevent its having place again 
io^morrow? Whatsoever the causes may be, is there any 
thing unreasonable in the supposition, that the same causts 
may at any time be productive of the same effects? Not that 
any such renewal presents itself as a very probable occur- 
rence: for the grand object, i/iz. dependence-^r-com^XtiQ ^lA 
absolute dependence— being by this time so effectually se- 
cured, as it appears to have been, and in so snug and quiet 
a way, corruption in any such barefaced shape would be al- 
together needless; and the danger of and from (xposure^ 
remote as it would however be, is more than, by learned 
prudence, would, when unsweetened by any ulterior ad- 
vantage, be incurred. 

Thus much for the corruption. But in the corrupcion^ 
iad as it is, we do not by any means see the zjnorst part oC 
the business. 

The worst part of the business is the contempt-»-the opeii 
rontempt, put upon Parliament : disobedience, such as it is 
impossible, should not have been witfut, manifested aft 
•towards one of its recent laws. Here we see the axe laid 
4o-the very root of Government : and by what hands ? Not 
by Jacobins and leyelUrs — not by men who meet at taverns, 
and get up upon tables: but by the very husbandmen thetH- 
selves ; — the very nursery-men, by whom Mr. Reeves*s 
tree — (the tree that was so near falling upon his head, ai^d 
without falling on it prepared it for so many good plaisters) 
— ^the very nursery-men by whom that nutritious and uiiir 
hrageous sugar-tree, ought to have been ilursed, and who 
aire so well paid for nursing it. 

But of this most serious staie offence-^-^this dissolution* 
threatening offence— -in comparison of which so ordinary 
and regular an offence as corruption shews, in the eye of a 
really loyal subject, but as a peccadillo, more will be said in 
another place. (See Part IV. Chap. %*) Be it mestilinii 
remembered, that the fact is established. 

Other facts, not altogether devoid of importance, remain 
to be affirmed or disaffirmed by inquiry and evidence. 

By what hand was it that the bribery guinea— 'the addi** 
tional and prohibited guinea-^was pat into the ready hand of 
the Exchequer Gmnta^mtn, in despite of the sutute ? Thii 



ft ^4 Chap. II. Double-fee Aiuse, plain and embroidered » 

is a question, tlic answer to which, but for form sake, needs 
no evidence. That of the Solicitor, of the Board which 
ever it was, under the orders of which the prosecution was» 
in each instance, ordered. 

Two otlier questions. — ^The Master Packer, and the Master 
Packer'' 5 Master — the Deputy Remembrancer, and the Lord 
Chief Baron — were they respectively apprised of it ? 

At wh^t t\me was it that this ** abhorred'* practice did 
sometimes take place-r— how many were ihese '* many years 
V since** it was known to do so? 

In whose Chief Baronship was it? In that of Eyre — in 
that of Skinner-r-in that of Smyth? — or in any part of the 
thirty years presidency of the old Attorney, knighted and 
made honest — as honest as to an English Judge it is possible 
to be — by the title of Sir Thomas Parker? Or was it at any 
time under the presidency of the present Lord Chief Baron, 
of whose services in that high station the country has had 
the benefit now for ahpve these sixteen years:* if yes, 
whether it has been with his privity that any particular in^ 
dividual instance of this practice has taken place, and whe- 
ther this has been among the means employed by him for the 
attainment of the object so effectually accomplished, and so 
solicitously defended ?+ 

These are among the ** secrets** which may perhaps pre- . 
sent themselves as '* worth knowing," whensoever Mr, 
Whitbreadf refreshed by a summer recess, shall feel himself 
sufficiently refreshed to return to the charge; to return to 
the charge, and by one pull moie — one pull, sufficient in 
length as well as strength, drag them completely and eflisc- 
tually out of the den of Cacus.

To the Great Law Officer, on any future occasion should 
k ever happen to him to get up, and come out with a speech 
of a mixt nature such as the ahove^ composed of part argu- 
ment, and part evidence, Mr. Whitbread^ or whosoever on 
any such occasion may occupy his place, will perceive, I am 
inclined to think, the use and propriety of decomposing such 
speech, and resolving it into those its component elements. 
As to the argument it need pot give him much trouble : that 
may be left to answer itself. But the evidence is quite 
another thing: here he will see the use and necessity o£ 
that useful operation called cross -examination. I don't mean, . 
that even upon the Great Law Officer himself, it should be 
performed in his awn mode: of that it would surely be 
better to leave the monopoly in his own hands. I don't 
mean, that he should be called ** the greatest fool that ever 
** walked over eartk'^ with or •' xmthout a Keeper,^** I don't 
mean, that he should be examined for no other purpose than 
to expose to contempt the witness, nor with any other effect 
than to expose to the same fate the examiner and the Judge: 
the examiner wKo makes such examinations, and the Judge 
who suffers them. What I mean is, that he should be exa- 
mined — cross-examined-— in whatever mode may happen to 
be best adapted to the getting out the truth : — which surely ' 
will be a very different mode.

PART IV, 



REMEDIES PR0P06ED. 

CHAP. I. Humble proposal tor restoring THt 
CoNbTiTUTiON iNrREGARD TO Juries. 

4 1. Introduction, Necessity of a Change in the System^ 

XN the course of this inquiry, two dangerous diseases haV6 
necessarily and continually been bropght to view :-— a roC^ 
tenness in one of the most important organs of the body 
potitiCi viz. Jury trial: 2. a sort of zveaimss about lh# 
head, having for Its synoptoms, on the part of fudges and 
other subordinate members o{ Government, a conhrmed, 
habitual, and scarcely disguised contempt, as towards tba; 
authority of the Legislature* 

The existence of the disease having, in both instances^ 
been brought to view, next comes the more immediately 
beneficial task, but for which that unpleasant one woii)a 
never have been undertaken, viz, the indication of the pro* 
per remedy. 

In this chapter wjll be proposed, what presents itself kt 
proper to be done, in regard to yttrzdf. 

That within the Sheriffwick of the Sheriffs of LondcMI 
and Middlesex, the insiitunon of 5^<fafl/ Juries, composed 
as at present, ought to ,be abolished-^s supposed to have al- 
ready been sufficiently demonstrated. Ik so, the consdi^ 
quence is — that within this district some different system 
will require to be set on foot. But, forasmuch as the esca<r. 
blishing in one particular district, though it be the district 
of the metropolis, a system different from whaiLis fc use im 
the greater part of the kingdom, might, by infusing addi- 
tional complication into a system of judicature already so 
over-loaded with complication, -be productive of prepon- 
derate inconvenience ; hence we are led to the consideration 



ai8 Chap. L Restore the Constitution as to Juries. 

of some plan which, being grounded on prinaples univer- 
sally applicable, may itsdf be susceptible ot an application 
equally universal without preponderant inconvenience. 

The remedy here ventured to be proposed is stiled with- 
out scruple a restorative: 2l plan for the restoring, for the 
purpose of jfury trials the original composition of Juries. 
Not that the plan is such in exact tenor and detail : for, if it 
tuere^ it could not be such in principle and effect.* 

All political institutions would be exposed to deteriora- 
tion were it even by the mere change of circumstances : and 
if, where the change of circumstances is become material 
and extensive, the original constitution is left unchanged in 
detail, the consequence is— that, howsoever in words and 
outward shew it may be the same, it is become in substance 
and effect, in a proportionable degree, different. Nor yet 
would I have it thought, that in xny vocabulary old is syno- 
nimous to good^ or veiter, as in some vocabularies we have 
seen it, synonimous to not so good or bad. Be the state of 
things ever so good, to render them still better is, in my 
view of the matter, a good operation, not a bad one: the 
contrary opinion I leave to those in whose eyes^ the praise of 
letting off an old epigram is better worth than the consci- 
ousness of having rendered, or the endeavour xo render, a 
pyblic service. 

Accordingly, in the endeavour to bring about a restora- 
tion of the jury system in principle, 1 have not in detail neg- 
lected tljje opportunity of endeavouring to put it, for the 
fi;|ture, into a state as much superior as possible to any state 
it ever was in before. 

As to the existing Special Jury system, my real quarrel 
with it is — not that it is a different one from the original 
Jury system, but that, in comparison with it, it is a bad 
one. 

. * Bight-pencet for eiample, was the allowance given to a Juiyman, as long 
1^ as in the reign of James the Jst, (See Part I. Chap. 4. § i.) and we know 
not for what length of time before. Give him eight-pence at this time of day, 
the allowance, besides being in name the same, may be a moire or less proper one, 
but m effect so far from being the same, it is a very widely different one. And so, 
tt often as money is concerned, and on whatsoever occasion, and for whatsoever 
INwpoie iilpitio|2cd--take for example, qualifications fqr Parliamentary Electors*.

5 2* Interests to he provided for \ — Objects to be axmedai. 

For remedy to the disorders in question, before we enter 
upon the task of suggesting particular arrangements, it may** 
be of use to have before us a distinct intimation of the se- 
veral interests requiring t# be provided for, and, for the» 
purpose of such provision, of the several objects or ends re- 
quisite to be kept in view and aimed at-^— *z/?z. in the framing- 
of a plan for the composition of jurors, the selection of the 
jurors, and the compensation, if any, to be made to them,* 
for their labour, loss of time, and expence. 

The interests concerned are, in the first place those of the 
suitors or parties on both sides of the cause, in. the next 
place those of the jurors themselves. 

. It is for the sake of the interests of the parties in each 
cause, or rather ol such party or parties as are in the tighU- 
viz. in so fiir as he or they are in the right, that it becomes 
an object with the legislator, to make such provision as the 
nature of the case admits of, for securing oil the part of 
jurors such degree of relative aptitude, in all points, intel* 
Itctual as well as morale as shall render the general tenor of 
their decisions as conformable as possible to the ends of 
justice. 

Follows a brief intimation of these objects, ranged under 
three gf*neral heads — 

I. Objects referable to the head of probity or moral apti^ 
tude. 

1. Preserving Jurors as effectually as possible from ex- 
posure to the action of such sinister influence as is liable to 
be exercised by, or to emane from persons in power; and 
more particularly by or from the presiding and directing^ 
Judge QX Judges as above, 

2. Preservirrg them, as above, from such sinister influ- 
ence in the shape of intimidation, corruption, or partiality^ 
as is liable to be exercised -by, or to emane from indivtr 
duals or classes of men, in the character whether of parties. 
or of persons having in any other way an interest in the 
event of eaci* respective cause. 

II. Objects referable to the head of intellectual aptitude. ■ 

3. In a judicatory so composed, "fxov'xd^in^ upon occasion 
a degree of extra-aptitude, in respect of intdlectuat qualifi- 
cations; viz. in consideration of, and iti propohion to, any 




S2« Chap« I. Restore the Constitution as to Juries. 
<legree of txiXK-difficulty attached to this or that particfuiar 

^. or in consideration of, and in proportion to, any 

degree of extra-importance • 

IIL Objects kamng respect to the interests of the Jurors 
themselves, 

^. Reducing to its minimum the quantity of vexation and 
ixpence atuched to judicial serviflt in this Hne. 

6. Providing compensation for such pK>rtion of vexation 
and expence, as cannot be avoided without preponderant 
inconvenience: viz, without preponderant prejudice to the 
main object above-mentioned. 

^ 3. Arrangements proposed, 1. In Common Jury causes ^ 

mix Gentlemen zvitk Yeomen, 

Here follows a slight sketch of the Arrangements that 
present themselves as promising to be conducive to the at- 
uinment of the above objects: in case of convict, regard 
being bad all along to their respective degrees of impor- 
faDce» absoluU and comparative. 

1 • The distinction between Common and Special Jury- 
men to be still preserved .-^The object aimed at by this ar- 
IMgement is-^rovision for intellectual aptitude. 

t^ In ordinary or Common Jury cases — i, e, in those cases 
in which at present the Jurors are all of them of the class of 
Common Jurymen — (say for distinction Yeomen Jurymen) let 
tOfnc one or two of the class of Special Jurymen, (say for dis- 
tinction Gentlemen Jurymen,) be regularly inserted into each 
Jury.— ^^c/, intellectual aptitude:— wz. under the expec- 
tation, that, for the benefit of justice, the influence of un- 
derstanding upon understanding will exercise itself, of 
course, upon the UssAnformed class, by the instrumentality 
of the better -informed, 

3, Nuniber of Gentlemen Jurors not more than one or 
two.— The interest provided for by this restriction is that of 
Jurors: tf^'^f/, avoidance of unnecessary vexation and ex* 
pmce: viz. of vexation and expence, by reason of atten- 
dance; viz, on the part of an over-proportion of jurors of 
this class. 

4. The district in which the Gentlemen Jurors are 
taken, let it be a district as remote as on other accounts 
wll be consistent with convenience, from the district in 
wbicb the Yeomen Jurymen are taken. Object^ providing 



|[ 3* 1 • ^'i Cotfimon Jury Causes^ mixGerUkmin with Yeomen, tt t 

for moral aptitude on the part of Yeomen Jurors, viz. by 
preserving them from being subjected to sinister influence 
^ — viz. to influence of ioill over aw/f-— whether in the shape 
of intimidation^ or in the shape of corruption^-^msiTiiimi^ 
from Gentlemen Jurors. 'At the hands oi the Gentlemea 
Jurors— -of the men of superior education — the salutary 
species of influence— -znz* the influence of understanding 
over understanding — of opinion on opinion-*-is looked for 
and desired. The use of the distance proposed, is-^to serve 
as a bar to the exercise of will over mlL To men of the 
Yeomen class — to shop-keepers, handicrafts, &c. living in 
the same neighbourhood with the Gentleman, it might Tre* 
quently happen to view in his supposed disposition towards 
them a source of hope or fear. By distance this source of 
corruption would be cut ofi*.* 



§ 4. Arrangements continued — %, Special Juries ^ half-and-half. 

Power to any party, on cither side, to cause to be sub- 
stituted to the common jury composed as above, a half and 
half ']\xTy\\ viz, a jury — not composed of all gentlemen, as 
in the case of the special jury constituted as at present-*^,

are, in the first place, by ihe enlargement of the number of 
the gentlemen jurors, intellectual aptitude: viz, by adding 
to the chance of finding a juryman qualified in an extra de- 
gree for taking the lead, and guiding the decision : in the 
next place by the restriction put upon the number of the 
jurymen of that class, moral aptitude : viz. by preventing 
the preponderance of partiality as between rank and rank. 

Of the sort of mixture here proposed, the importance is 
such as seems to claim a particular degree of developement. 
In every species of judicatory without exception, but in a 
more pre-eminent degree in every judicatory of which a 
jury forms a part, of all imaginable causes of misdecision 
what is commonly understood by the term partiality is that 
which the legislator finds greatest difficulty in coping with. 
Wheresoever the nature of the influence— the sinister in- 
fluence — supposes two parties— one acting, the other acted 
on — his task is comparatively an easy one. All that in that 
case he has lo do, is — to keep them from coming together: 
and, with a moderate degree of probity, exertion, and in- 
telligence, how easy that is may have been seen already. 

But the case of partiality supposes not any such parties : 
it supposes not any tempter from without. The tempter 
dwells within : within the very bosom of this occasional 

^udge: and, being there, in vain would legislators dislodge 
im, he bids defiance to their utmost efforts. 
Religion or politics — if, by the nature of the case, any «uch 
cause of dissention happens to be called forth — called forth 
.in such manner as to excite, in the bosoms of any of the 
jurors, sentiments — whether of sympathy or antipathy — in 
relation to the parties on each or either side — against this 
source of partial affection — of corrupt affection, (as, even 
though there be no corruptor, it may be stiled) against this 
source of misdecision^ all that in the station of the legislator 
pan be done by human wisdom is here without avail : in this 
shape, corruption may have established in a man's bosom 
ever so complete an empire, there it must reign, and reign 
iincontrouled : you can never punish it, for you can never 
prove it. ^ 

Among jurymen, a possil)le, and not unnatural, source 
of partiality^ on either or both sides of a cause, and thence 
of dissention^ is that of which difierence of rank and station 
in life is the instrument. 

' With partiality and dissention in this shape, the proposed 
haff'-and'haff^ j\iTy, as well asany other jury, stands exposed

to be infected : and indeed by the nature of its cdnstltution 
and composition, may appear, and not altogether without 
reason, to be exposed to that accident in a particular degree^ 
But while it contains in itself the seeds of the disease, it 
furnishes at the same time a remedy: — a remedy — such ah 
one as cannot in any other mode be supplied. 

Take, for example, a case, such as, m the country at least 
where there is no Guinea corps, is frequently exemplified-^ 
a special jury, with a deficiency in it made up by Yeomen: 
by common iurymen^ in the character of /a/<fi;^7f^. Suppose^ 
as between a Gentleman and a Yeomati, a cause so circum-. 
stanced a^ to awake, in the bosoms of these different parts 
of the population of the jury-box — to awaken, and to excite, . 
to a degree of excitation fatal to justice, the passions aad 
partialities congenial to their respective stations. In this 
case, let there he seven gentlemen to Jive yeomen, the gentle- 
man carries it. But, suppose six and six, as under the pro- 
posed constitution will constantly be the case, in this case 
partiality may reign without opposition in eleven bosoms, so 
as one of the twelve, even though it be but one, be the seat . 
of cool and impartial justice, he who has right on his side, 
be he gentleman or yeoman, gains the cause. 

Of the proposed provision, by which the number of 
Gentlemen Jurymen even on a Special Jury is limited to 
half the whole number, viz, to six out of the twelve, the 
expected use is as follows: — Inordinary cases, for the pur- 
pose of guidance, by means of intellectual aptitude, one or 
at. most two, was, as above (§ 3.) regarded as sufficient. 
For this sane purpose, the additional chance, afforded by 
the substitution of six to tzub or one, may, it is supposed, 
be regarded as amply sufficient, even in any the most extra- 
ordinary cases. 

As to the case of a contention between opposite classical 
partialities, a case of this sort, it is hoped and supposed, 
will, comparatively speaking, be a rare one. But, that it 
should now and then find itself exemplified is no more than 
what ought to be expected, and provided against accord- 
ingly. 

Here then comes in an occasion, for applying to this 
case that beautiful feature of jury-trial, which, by the use 
thus proposed to be made of it; can scarcely fail to have 
been already presented to the reader's notice: that no lest 
politic than generous arrangement, contrived by the genii^t 
af some now forgotten statesman, for the prc^e^tfon of 






$84 Clap. I. tUfi0r€ ^ C^nshiution as i$ Jkries, 

/areignifs against those adverse interests and antipathiear 
which are io unhappily apt to have place in the bosoms of 
nadvis^ 

A mind in which virtue in both her forms, moral and in* 
tellectual« shines thus bright, can hardly have been that 
of a lawyer. In matters of foreign politics-— of political 
•conomy'-^in every branch of knowledge not immediately 
CondMcive to the advancement of theif own personal or pro- 
fessional interests, the breasts of lawyefs, especially in the 
^ highest situations^*^ are even in these comparatively en- 
lightened times, among the most noted tabernacles of ignO' 
t4snc€: of ignorance, and of that error which, when accom- 
panied with the degree of presumption so natural to such 
situations, is so much worse and more mischievous than 
simple ignorance. 

when, for the benefit of foreigners the haff-and-hidf 
jury was introduced, it was not confined to the cases called 
dxnl cases: nor among cases called criminal^ to those of in- 
ferior importance: it covered the whole field of jury trial. 

As to special jury trial, slid in by lawyers for the advance- 
ment of their own interests, and accordingly as it were by 
stealth, introduced by them, as we have seen, in pursuit of 
those two grand sinister objects, increase of power and pro^ 
fii to themselves, they neither dared nor cared to give it any 
such all-comprehensive range. 

But, if needful for causes of property, and in the case of 
offences comparatively trivial, how much more needful 
must it not be in causes which, to the individuals at least 
whose station is on the defendant's side, are oi the very 
highest importance, causes of life and death ? 

A principle which, in expectation of the superiority of 
intelligence expected from superiority of rank, gives up the 
reins without controui, to Q\(ixy prejudice and ^veiy partia^ 
iity, with which it can happen to that intellectual superip- 
rity to be accompanied, is rotten at the core.

As to us, so moderate is our claim, that with that equa« 
lity of numbers^ which is all we ask fof, the advantage, in 
any contest between you and us, would still be most de- 
cidedly on your side. 

On your side is the superiority of intellectual force in 
all its shapes: — knowledge^ address ^ habit of taking the lead. 

On your side is the whole force of that influence which 
exerts, itself on the understanding. On your side' is every 
element of what is called respectability : education^ opulence^ 
power, rank, connection. On no other occasion does this 
your superiority ever find you backward* in the assertion o£ 
it : asserting it on every other occasion, and to every other 
purpose, on this occasion alone, to this purpose alone, you 
will not surely take upon you to deny it. 
. On your side is the whole force of that still more irresis- 
tible influence, which by will is exerted over will. To your 
class our's looks up — looks up with hope — {ox employ , cus* 
torn, protection^ every thing: your*s to oiir's, for nothing. 
From your class, our's has every thing io fear; your's fronx 
our*s, nothing. Without any the slightest ground, or sa 
much as a pretence, a man of your class has but to bring aii 
action against one of oiir's, or if an action be not oppres- 
sive enough, to Jile A bill against him, his ruin follows of 
course. This is what we are indebted for, both of us, to 
your good friends, the lawyers. I say yours: for your's 
they arc as against us; and your*s they would be, it they 
were any body's. 

But, to come to the point at once. Can you seriously 
think, and seriously take upop you to say, that, in case o£ 
difference, six of ns can, in general, have as good a chance 
of persuading six of you, as six of you of persuading six 
of us? 

What we not merely consent to, but propose and desire 
is — that in ordinary cases — in ail cases but those in which 
this proposed equality of numbers happens to be insisted 
on, there should be some two or one at least of you, for 
our guidance : — so far is this claim on our part from having 
for its principle any sentiment of hostility towards you;— 
any sentiment inconsistent with cordiality, respect, and de^.- 
ference. As to confidence, unbounded confidence, it is 
more than human natme can ever, in the instance of any 
individual, much more in any large ckiss of individuals, 
I'^v claim- to, with anV colour of reason or justice: and with

§ 5« 3« Arrangements continued — Compensation'Money to 

Jurymen. 

1. In the allowance to jurymen distinguish two parts: 
one for demurrage^ viz. at the place of trial ; the other for 
journeys^ viz. thither and back : demurrage-money the ' same 
to all : joumey-money proportioned to the distance between 
the place of trial, and each juryman's place of residence^ 
and rated at so much a mile. 

2. To save calculation, and prevent disputes, after takings 
in each parish, a particular spot — say the site of the parish 
church — for the mark, let the distances of the several 
parishes from the place of trial be previously ascertained, 
once for all, and, in the form of a Table^ written or printed, 
kept hun^ up in the Court ; and also in the Office^ in which 
payment is made to the jurymen. 

g. For demurrage^ let the allowance to each juryman be 
to much a day for the whole time of his necessary stay : 
«nd without regard to the number of causes in which it may 
have happened to him ^ to serve: the amount being ^r^.^j^- 
pointed^ viz. by a general regulation, having for its object 
the fixing it at whatever sum is regarded as being at that 
iime and place necessary and sufficient for the maintenance 
of a juryman of the Yeomen class: which fixation may 
consequetitly, in respect of the change in the value ot 
money, require amendment from time to time.* 

* Where the length either of journeys or of demurrage is any thing conside* 
T&ble, paying a jurymen ly the cause neither could then be, nor ever can be, 
any thing better than a very unequal plan of payment. For since it would 6om* 
^ inonly, if not always, happen, that the samejurymanyronld have to serve in divert 
tcutses, therefore when, in the instance of any such occasional Judge» the number 
of causes in which he served happened to be above the calculation, {viz, the cal- 
culated number, in the expectation of which Che fixation of the sum in question 
took its rise) he might be to a considerable amount a gamer : when below that 
mark, to a considerable amount a loser. HeVe then was a sort of lottery: but in 
jespect of the ballance in point of comfort, all such lotteries are disadvantage- 
■iftts upon the whole. 

Be this as it may> till at a comparatively late period, the circumstances oC 
the times admitted of no other. It was not till the reign of Henry the 8th, vn. 
by statute 22 Hci^. 8. c. 5. that for raising supplies for public purposes, any such 
Mtts as the County rates appear to have bfca in use. If 60, the purse of ooe ok

4* Let the allowance be neither more nor less to Gentle* 
ttien than to Yeomen Jurymen. 

For, if to the Gentleman the expence of attendance will 
naturally be greater than to the Yeoman, it is because iii 
general the Gentleman, in respect of his superior opulence, 
is better able to afford it« 

True It is, that the rank of the Gentleman is not exempt 
from indigence: understand casual and relative indigence^ 
But neither is that of the Yeoman : and surely it is in the 
worst' provided class that the degree of indigence, and coa«" 
sequent suffering, is capable of being most acute,* 



•ther party was therefore the only fiiDd on which the expence could befiire that 
time be imposed. 

The year 1023 is the earliest point of time to which, on this subject, the in<* 
formation left to us extends. At that time, as already observed, (Part I. Chap* 
IV. % 1. p. VJ») dghfpeiice a headier cause was the allowance made to jurymen. 
And it was no greater in the Country, at the AssizeSf where a juibr might have 
30 or 40 miles to travel, than in the metropolis, at Nisi I^rius or at Bar, where 
he could not have more than a mile or two. 

In tho$e days eightpence was in real value as niiuch perhaps as between three 
and four shillings now. But we Know not at what earlier point of time this sum 
may have been fizt: nor consequently how much greater than at (Present the real 
value of it may then have been and been designed to be. 

Be this as it may, paying them by the cause must, at that time as at all times, 
have been, as already observed, an ineligible mode of payment : the amount of 
the allowance being to each person uncertsun, and therefore in point of general 
comfort, the arrangement a disadvantageous one upon the whole. 

* If human reason had been in use to apply itself to the subject of judicial 
procedure in general, and to jury trial, considered as a part of it, in particular^ 
the multitude of persons subjected to vexation in this shape, would never have 
been, for all causes without distinction, fixed at so large a number as twehe. 
But this is among the subjects to which as yet human reason has not been in use 
to apply itself : among non-lawyers scarce any perspn, in point of intellectual 
acquirements, competent, in any degree, to the task, having found and felt ia 
his bosom a jDarticukr interest, strung enough to call fofth the application oC 
them to the subject: and as to lawyers, acting all along under the impulse of a 
professional interest opposite in almost every point to that of the public iu gene- 
ral, the disposition to endure inconveniences in all shapes without remedy, not 
the disposition to be on the look-out for remedies, is the disposition which, on 
all causes, it has been their study to keep up, ^id inculcate. 

But (co put an impossible supposition) had any interests other than those of 
the all-powerful framers of the system, viz. the Judges, with their associates and 
dependents, the professional and other official lawyers — ^had in a word the inte- 
rests of the people, either in the character of suitors, or in the character of 
jurymen, presided over the details of it, the reduction would not have stopped 
there; but, having regard to the whole of this mass of vexation together, 
would have confined the production of it to the case in which, in the judgment. 
ef one or other of the parties interested, it would be of uso ' in a word, everf

pensation-Money shall be charged. 

1. As well in ordinary or common ju^ry causes, [viz. where, 
by the supposition, no more than one or two Gentlemen are 
upon the jury) as in cxir ^ordimry ot special jury causes, 
where (also by the supposition) *as many . Gentlemen as 
Yeomen are upon the jury, let the expence of the above 
proposed compensation-money [s^y jury -money) be borne— 
not by the suitor on either side, but by the public at large : 
— viz. by being added to the County-rates : — unless, for this 
particular purpose alone it were worth while to look out for 

. a mode of assessment more equable. 
. The interest here provided for is that of the suitors : viz^ 
- on that side of the cause on which, whether in the right or 
the wjong, this part of the costs of suit would otherwise 
be imposed.* 

2. In a special jury cause, /. e. where, at the requisition 
of a party on either side, a half and half jury has been or- 
dered, to prevent a disproportionate quantity of vexation in 
this shape from falling on the Gentlemen's class, let an extra 
sum of money, at the rate of so much a head for the extra 
number of jurors allowed (wz. four ox Jive) be charged in 
the way of costs, on the party by whom the requisition was 

cause) not of a penal nature, would, in the first instance, have been determined 
in the mode so strongly insisted on in another place : (See Scotch Reform Let* f.) 
vh, in the way of natirral procedure, in a single-seated judicatory, as now before 
a Justice of the Peace ; jury trial not being resorted to but in the way of 
Qppeol, 

♦ From- the aggregate number of lawsuits which receive their decision in th« 
course of a given length of time, the aggregate body of non-litigants, in propor- 
tion as those decisions are, or are supposed to be, conformable to justice, derivt 
g^ratis that security, which the aggregate body of litigants in those same suits do 
not enjoy but at the charge of the aggregate mass of vexation and expence at* 
tached to those several suits. (Sec Protest against Law Taxes,) 

On this principle, so Tar as bona Jide litigants alone are concemed^-on this, 
were tliis the only principle consulted, there is not any part of the expence 
of litigation that ought not to be shifted ofF from the purses of litigants upon 
the public purse. But, if this transferrence were extended to thcrmhole, litiga- 
tion would be converted into a game : in which the expence of the stakes, being 
borne by the ])ublic, would thus be raised to an infinite quantity: raised, viz, foi 
% the amusement of litigants and profit of lawyers. Where however the cxpencr 
assessed on the public is incapable of being increased, in so far as this isthecase, 
the mischief in question cannot by the transferrence in question be increased. 
And in this case is the allowance here proposed to be made, as iffeU M tbat pait 
Qf tl\p emoluments of Judges %vhich is in the shape of salary.

made: payable, however— wo/ to the Gentlemen jurymen, 
but to the County or other public Fund on which, as above, 
the ordinary expence of JAiry-money is- proposed to be 
charged. 

Interest provided for, that of jurymen: viz* Gentlemen 
jurymen : — object aimed at — prevention of vexation — xnz. of 
vexation which, in the shape of jury-service, might other- 
wise fall in an undue proportion on that class, 
. 3. Immediately after the trial, upon the bringing in of the 
Verdict, let the Judge, instead of leaving the expence of 
the extra jury-money to lie, as^ above, upon the party by 
whom the half-and-half ]\ity was required, have power 
either to impose it on any other party, or simply to take it 
off: in which latter case the contribution destined, as above, 
for the public fund will for this time not be received* 

4* In the event of his^ exercising, in either way, the above 
proposed power, it ought to be under the notion, and natu* 
rally will be, that the cause is of the number of those which, 
on some special ground or other, will warrant the imposing 
on the Gentlemen's class this addition to the quantity of vex- 
ation imposed upon them in this shape. This special ground 
will, as above, be either 1. extra difficulty^ 2. extra impor^ 
tance^ or 3. demand for equality of numbers on the score 
of apprehended partialities^ say more briefly apprehended par-^ 
tialities, , In the terms- of his order ^ let the Judge specify 
On which of these several grounds it has been founded. 

5. For a further check upon the practice of making wan- 
ton demandis on the time of the GentlemjerC s class, lest the 
simple charge of the extra jury -money (which at the present 
established rate will amount to no more than either four or 
five guineas) should not be sufficient, let the Judge have 
moreover power to increase it at his discretion, up to a li- 
mited amount :• suppose, for example, treble the amount o£ 
the simple charge. 

6, The form of the Judge's order may, in any of the 
above^ases, be extremely simple: — as for example*— i.TXtj 
cause being by me deemed proper for the "cognizance of a 
special jury^ viz. on the score of [then proceed to say

sition made of a special jury in this cause by < [here

instead of ■ being the simple amount of the extra

let the sum paid by him be — — — (jiere mention the 
sum, J 

7. Let fines for non-attendance be paid to and in exonera* 
tion of the fund on which the expence of jury-money is 
imposed. 

For further explanation and justification of the above pro- 
posed arrangement^ a few more words may perhaps not be 
ill bestowed. 

As in the case of the Yeomen* s class, so in the case of the 
Gentlemen* s class, Justice requires that as in any other shape, 
so in the shape m question^ a disproportionate quantity of 
vexation shall not be imposed : thence the ground for the 
preventive measures above proposed. 

But, rather than any extra pecuniary allowance, in the 
name of compensation-money^ should be given to individuals 
v)f the Gentlemen's class in contradistinction to, and at the 
expence of, those of the Yeomen's class, better the money 
were thrown into the sea. By any such extra allowance, a 
pernicious principle — a principle of sordid and oppressive 
partiality — would be perpetuated : and public service in this 
shape, would, instead of being a burthen indeed, but an 
honourable and useful, nor that a heavy burthen— ^imposed 
on all alike, would as at present be an object of rapacity 
and intrigue, sought for and obtained by such as are least 
deserving of it. 

If, upon this plan, vexation^ in the shape in question, 
should, in a proportion a little greater, (and it could be but 
a little greater) fall on the Gentlemen^s class than on the 
YeomerCs^ the overplus would, it is supposed, find for its 
Justification the following grounds, none of which could 
liave any application in the opposite case. 

|. In the character of suitors, to the lot of the Gentle^ 
men's class fall, in by far the larger proportion, as well 
.causes that are attended with extra difficulty as those which 
are attended with extra importance, 

%* When, on the only remaining ground, viz, the ground 
pC apprehended pc^rtialities^ a special ]\ixy is allowed, (?, e. a 
jury containing an extra proportion of Gentlemen) h is, pnn- 
fif^Uy if nQt solely, for the |)rotectiQn pf tbe iatercitl Qf 



^ & 4* ^^^ Compensatton-Mon^ shall he charged, i^gi 

tills class, in case of any conflict which it may have witU 
the interests, passions, or prejudices of the other. Receiv* 
ing this extra ienefit, they ought not to grudge a small por- 
tion of extra burthen, 

3. Between the Gentlemen's class and the Yeomen's, 
the characteristic difference is— that, of the Gentlenian*s 
time a portion may be applied to this public purpose— to the 
purpose of judicature, without imposmg upon him a loss o£ 
a pecuniary nature : whereas ih the case of the Yeoman a 
tax upon his time is, ];)esides the tax upon his time^ a tax 
upon his purse. 

4. Service in this line being a source of useful informa- 
tion, and^ like a scholastic exercise, a source of intellec- 
tual power, whether it be or be not pleasant to the particu- 
lar individual, it is for the advantage of the public at large 
that each man should have his share of it: and if this oe 
true even in the instance of the Yeomen's class, whose 
share in other branches of Government is comparatively so 
small, it must be so in a more eminent degree in the in- 
stance of the Gentlemen's class, whose share in other 
branches of Government is comparatively so large. 

By service, in the department of justice in t]^ character 
of juryman 9 a man is, in some measure, trained and fitted 
for service in the field of Government at large, in the cha- 
racter of parliamentary Elector, . 

^. It may be of' use that it should be distinctly seen on 
what ground stands the demand for an extra number o£ 
Gentlemen jurymen on the score of extra difficulty or extra 
importance — in a word, on any other ground than that of 
apprehended partialities to the prejudice of that same class. 
For the purpose of guidance, if by no other than the only 
useful and proper sort of influence, viz. influence of un- 
derstanding oyer understanding, one man of superior intel- 
lectual aptitude is as sufficient as any greater number could 
be : to this purpose therefore the only advantage gained by 
any addition to the number of Gentlemen in the jury, is 
the additional chance it affords of obtaining the requisite de- 
gree of aptitude in this shape, in the person of some one. 

In regard to the ^nes for "non-attendance^ the present 
isystem being inefficient, and almost completely nugatory, 
to give effect to them, and reconcile at the same lime to . 
each other the antagonizing ends of justice, woulcl rcr

f Qft Xihap, I. Rutore the Constitution ar to Juries, 

but honest, might easily enough be carried into effect. On 
this head, a few general hints are as much as room can be 
found for in this place. 

1. The interest that individuals at large have in the^^^w^- 
ral fund — say the County Fund — not affording to any one of 
them a motive adequate to the purpose of engaging him to 
ivatch over its interest in this behalf with effect, a special 
interest must be given to some one person— for example, 
the person by whom the monies of this fund are received : 
a special interest, viz. in the form of a per centage upon, 
the amount. • 

3, Into the pocket of this one person the money ought to 
be made to 'find its way as it were of course 2 viz. without 
need of a law suit to be instituted by him^ much less by. 
any one else, for that purpose. 

3. On nonappearance of any person summoned to ap- 
pear for the purpose of jury service, let the money he, by 
a certain day thereafter, levied on him of course; unless at 
the day, appointed for appearance, in lieu of the person 
himself, there appear, under his signature, a paper exhibit-, 
ing some one or more of a list of legitimate excuses, to be 
allowed and mentioned as such in the form of the summons : 
the facts o£p8uch excuses to be established by an affidavit, 
with or without co-attestators as the case may be, according 
to printed iorms^ pre-appointed for the purpose, free of stamp- 
duty, and every other avoidable expence. 

Were the arrangements left to him, a member, of xhtjirm 
of Judge and Co* would settle them on this occasion as he 
does on others* From this burthen as from others, applica- 
tions made for relief in the case where by accident, as 
above, the burthen has been rendered undue, would be mor^ 
burthensome than the burthen itself t of an application thus 
made, ' the burthen would be certain, success precarious^ 
Defaulters without excuse would remain unpunished: de- 
faulters with good excuse— defaulters from necessity — would 
be oppressed, ,To each useful purpose the system would be 
inefficient : suffering to particular individuals, with pickings 
to Judge and Co. out of the same, would be theuonly fruit 
of it. 

At the same time the whole business would be conducted 
with the most unimpeachable regularity. Precedent would 
have been pursued in every thing that was done: and thus, 
#s u^ual, all complaining mouths would be shut;— unlearned 



§ 7' 5* Formation of the qualified list, 233 

mouths shut, learned shoulders saved harmless ; saved, froiu 
every particle of burthen^ as in all other shapes, so in the 
shape of blame. 



^ 7. Arrangements continued — 5. Formation of the aualified 
List — viz. in other Counties j £^c. as well as Middlesex* 

The basis of the jury system being the qualified list, the 
plan here brought to View might appear chargeable with 
oversight or negligence, if a topic so material were alto- 
gether passed by in silence. But the relevant facts being in 
so high a degree diversified, and for the most part so inex- 
tricably buried in obscurity, the nature of the case pre* 
cludesr every such attempt as that of proposing, in relation 
to this part of the subject, particularly in such a place as the 
present, any thing like a detailed^ determinate ^ and ip a 
geographical sense all-comprehensive, system of arrange* 
ments. 

By change, be it what it maiy, by innovation, on this as 
on every other part of the field, of law, inconvenience, in 
some shape or other, in some degree or other, is sure to be 
produced. Unless therefore and tintil, inconveniende in 
some specific shape, can be pointed out as lesulting, or 
about to result, from the arrangements actually in use, this 
general consideration, loose as it is, will, in each division 
of the country, as well ^s at every period of time, operate as a 
sufficient bar against any change that can be proposed. But 
no sooner is any such specific inconvenience pointed out, 
than the bar is provisionally removed : and then comes the 
operation of making a comparative estimate of the amount 
of inconvenience on both sides, in such sort that when 
placed by the mind in two opposite scales as in a ballance, 
a just conclusion may be formed, determining on which 
side the preponderance has place. 

But, in different territorial divisions, counties, and pri- 
vileged boroughs taken together, circumstances are, in this 
respect, so extremely different, that, independently of those 
changes, which, in sonje or all of them, are liable taJ^ 
brought about by tirne^ it can scarcely happen but thatTiif 
the same course be, in all of them, pursued without varia- 
tjon, inconvenience, and to no inconsiderable amouhty 



§2^ Chap. I. Restore the Constilution as to Juries. 

ivould, upon enquiry, be found, in some instances, to have 
place. 

Hence it is that, upon a general view of the subject, and 
antecedently to such particular enquiry, as no power other 
than that ot Parliament is competent to make with effect, 
a general enquiry, of the nature above-intimated, cannot 
with propriety be considered as superfluous. 

For any such enquiry, the present however is not the 
proper place. The alarming political grievance, the utter 
destruction impending over the palladium of the English 
constitution, the liberty of the press — this was the conside- 
ration, but for which the present enquiry would never have 
been engaged in. Of this mischief the County of Middle-* 
sex has, by the causes already spoken of, been rendered aU 
most the sole theatre. To the exclusion of these mischiefs, 
so far as depends upon the composition of the qualified list, 
an assemblage formed upon the principles upon which the 
composition of that list has hitherto been grounded, may, 
for any thing that hath as yet presented itself to my view, 
be sufficient : I mean of course with the help of such ulte- 
rior arrangements as may be conformable to the principles 
herein already brought to view. 

On what persons ought the obligation of serving on juries 
te be imposed ? Answer — On every human being, but for 
some apt and special cause, either of exclusion or exemption^ 
It is therefore by the indication of such causes ^ witn the 
reasons on which their aptitude in that character respectively 
depends, that the proper abstract answer to that question 
will, in its several ramifications, be furnished. So far as 
concerns exclusion, these causes would be found to bear a 
considerable analogy to the causes of exclusion applicable 
to the function of parliamentary elector. In some instances 
a cause that applies to the one function, would be found 
exactly applicable to the other: while in other instances 
such coincidence will be seen not to have place. But in 
the instance of every circumstance that, in the character of 
a cause of exclusion, can be proposed with reference to 
either function, whether it be deemed applicable to both 
functions or to one. only, and whichsoever be that one, con- 
sklrrable light would be seen to be thrown on the subject 
by the comparison thus proposed. 

Thus much may be said of both cases : t/fz. that, consi. 
deration had of the great change in the value of money, aft 



§ 7. 5» Formation of the qualified List* 235 

well as in other influencing circumstances, in abundance, if 
the existing arrangements were proper at the times at which 
they were respectively made, it is impossible that, taken all 
together, they should be equally so at present. 

At the same time, from the mere exrstence of that com* 
parative degree of impropriety, it follows not, that the ad- 
vantages capable of being gained by the removal of the im- 
propriety, would be an over-balance for the inconvenience 
that ought to be apprehended from a change. 

A state of things by no means incapable of being realized, 
and which ought therefore to be kept in view, is — that, th« 
arrangements, having been in a less degree proper at the 
time when they were made, have by change of circum- 
stances been rendered more proper than at first : — that, for 
example, the pecuniary part of the qualification, having 
originally been set at too high a rate, has, by the deprecia* 
tidn of money, been rendered more proper in the present 
less immature state of society, than it was in the more im- 
mature state of things which gave birth to it. 

For any attempt to penetrate any further into the subject, 
it would be time enough if, for any practical purpose, the 
observations herein already submitted to the public sbonld 
be found to have a claim to notice. Taking the County of 
'Middlesex in the first place for the local field, it would tken 
be time enough to extend the enquiry to the formation of 
the several original qualified lists for the several species of 
juries, relation being. likewise had to the several species of 
judicatories in which they have to serve. 

It would then also be time enough to extend and apply 
the whole of the enquiry to the several other Counties^ and 
judicial districts included in Counties. 

Should any such enquiry come to be instituted, the facts, 
collected and brought to light in relation to the County of 
Middlesex, by the public spirit, the activity, and intelligence 
of Sir Richard Phillips, fSee his above -mentioned WorA 
throughout J will be found highly serviceable: for, out of 
them may be formed a basis for enquiry, applicable to the 
several other cases just alluded to. As to all these matters, 
for the present at least, I can therefore do neither more nor 
better than to refer the reader to that eminentiy valuable and 
meritorious publication.^

^ 8. Arrangements continued — 6. Corruption by Individuals 
how prevented — No Party should foreknow his Jurymen. 

As well in special jury causes, viz. yi'iihdLhalf'and-half^ury'f 
as in common jury causes, with one or two Gentlemen jury- 
men, let matters be so ordered, that, to the parties on each 
side, it shall, to the latest'moment, be impossible to know, 
who the persons are that will serve as jurymen in the cause. 
The interest thus provided for, is that of the suitors, vit, 
in each cause that of him who is in the right : the object 
aimed at is — on the part of jurymen, moral aptitude: viz. in 
respect of exemption from such corruptive influence — such 
influence of will over will — as it may lie in the way of 
individuals in the character of suitors, to exercise on the 
decision of those their occasional Judges. 

On this occasion, before we come to speak of the means 
conducive to this end, observation will require to be taken 
of a sort of conflict which has place between interest and 
interest, and thence between object and object : between the 
interest of suitors , {viz, such as are on the right side as 
above) and the interest o{ jurymen. If that of jurjrmen 
were the interest that possessed the sole or the predominant 
claim to regard, rotation and that alone would be the princi- 
ple employed : for, as will be seen, in so far as that princi- 
ple is departed from, in so far on the part of jurymen vexa^ 
tion — the aggregate mass of vexation, produced by the obli- 
gation of serving in that character, must, viz. in respect of 
the number of them subjected to it, be increased. 

But in that case, of the jurors who will have to serve 
in a given cause, if no supernumeraries are summoned, 
the whole number, or if to make allowance for accidents 
supernumeraries are summoned, (but in no greater number 

But, the mention here made of so important a topic having been but indden^ 
taly I have not included it inform in the list of the changes Ae(C proposed. The 
subject being as yet far from exhausted, to do complete justice would requirCy 
i& by its importance it would well warrant, a separate publication. 

In any leading qittrter, during the short time that I can h«ve 3rct to live, 
should a disposition efcr manifest itself to coBsider the dictates of veracity and 
justice as fitter guides for the condact'of English judicature than blind and unre- 
flecting prejudice, itMrillt'^-n be -soon enough to bestow upon the subject a 
quantity of time and spact vr^i^tjrtioned to its importance. It might then he

than IS necessary to make sufficient allowance for such ac- 
cidents,) a large proportion of that number, might come to 
be foreknown to the suitors in that same cause. Here then 
is a door open to corruption — to corruption in that shape— 
or at least in one of those shapes — in which the existence 
of it — the notorious and declared existence of it — gave 
birth to the first of the whole string of those statutes 
relative to juries, in which any mention is made of special 
juries. 

If the principle of rotation be taken for the basis, two 
other principles ought therefore to be mixed with it : mixed 
with it, in the character of correctives and preservatives: 
correctives^ viz. to the tendency of that principle, when em- 
ployed crude and single, preservatives ^ viz. against the dan- 
ger of such sinister influence. The one is — the principle 
oi disconnection as above explained; disconnection as be- 
tween Gentlemen jury men and Yeomen jurymen, by means 
of local distance. The other is — the principle of chance: 
viz. as applied to the determination of the individuals that 
shall serve together on the occasion of each several cause. 

But, when applied on the occasion in question to the 
purpose in question, the principle of chance requires an in- 
crease of number — of the number of persons subjected to 
this vexation : it requires, for the purpose of each several 
cause, the attendance of a number greater than the number 
of those who will have to serve on the occasion of that 
same cause : for, if twelve (the number of those that serve 
on each cause) were all that, under and in virtue of tiie 
summonses delivered to them by the sheriff, were capable 
o£ serving in that cause, the consequence is, that of each 
man, in so far as it were certain that he would attend^ it 
would be certain that he would serve : and in this certainty 
there would be no room for chance. True it is that of his 
attendance even in that case there could be no absolute cer- 
tainty: for, besides the accidents, such as death and sick- 
ness, to which all mankind are subject, and over which the 
will of man has no controul, if, relation being made to 
the state of the law on one hand, and the state of his own 
affairs and inclinations on the other, it were to this or that 
man more agreeable to stay away in despite of the law, than 
attend in obedience to the law, he would do — as jurymen, 
or at least as Gentlemen Jurymen are at present suffered to 
do by Gentlemen Judges — he would stay away accordmgly. 
But, though, .to any fW purpose, certainty would not in 



•3^ Chap. 1. Restore the Constitution as to JfurieSt 

that case be attainable, yet to a bad purpose, viz. to ih€ 
purpose of corruption, in the way in question, a probability 
but too little short of certainty would ht attainable: for the 
corruptor, foreknowing — knowing as soon as the list of the 

i persons summoned, or about to be summoned, for service - 
fi the cause in question, were known to him — ^the corruptor 
knowing of twelve persons, in the power of every one of 
whom it would be, bating accidents, to serve, would at 
the same time know of so many persons, of the attendance 
of any one or more of whom he would, in the event of his 
succeeding in his plan of corruption in their instamce, be 
sufficiently assured. 

In the case of common juries, the statute so often spokefi 
of (3 Geo. 2. c. 25.) has, in § 8, with or without intending 
it, afforded for this salutary application of the principle of 
chance^ a sufficient basis : 72 being the greatest number, 48 
the least number which (regard being apparently had to the 
difFerence between County and County in respect to loc(U 
extent) it allows to be summoned to appear, on each occa-» 
. sion, for example, at each Assize^ for the trial of whatever- 
number of causes may happen to be ready for trial at that 
Assize. But not only of this least allowed number 48, but 
of a considerably less number it is evident, that, with the 
help of the principle of chance, it might ^e made use of. 
in such manner as to render corruption — previous inter- 
course, and thence corruption — on the part of andividuals^ 
practically speaking impossible. For the first cause that 
comes on for trial, immediately before the trial, let the names^ 
of all such as are present be put into a dark box, shaken 
together, and so drawn out. If of these twelve it were de- 
termined that after this first cause they required respite, 
(though for the Judge who has the guidance of them there 
is no respite) these might on the second cause be all of them 
set aside, and for that second cause the lottery be confined 
to the remainder: and, the first twelve being after their re- 
spite replaced in the lottery, so on through any number of 
causes. 

But if in the instance of any one cause, it be in the 
power of any one person of himself to determine^ or by any 
other means to know of, a set of persons, in the power of 
each or even any one of whom it shall be in the character of 
juryman to serve, in the power of that one person it is, 
whether by neglect or by design, to introduce an intended 
corruptor to so many persons in whose power it will be, ii 



^ 8* 6» Corruption by IrKhvUuals kow prevented. $239 

corrupted, to secure to him the verdict he desires : and« the 
mater the number of the persons to whom it happen^ to be 
m possession of this knowledge, the greater the number of 
such possible introductors^ and by that means the greater the 
probability that such corruption will take place/ 

Let for instance the rule be such, , that it is by a certain, 
person, for example the Sheriffs (that is to say the Attorney ^ 
by whom,- in the character ot Under Sheriffs the business is 
donejr— that it is by this person that the list of the persons* 
who are to be summoned to serve as jurors on the occasion 
in question, for example on the Assize in question, are to be 
determined ;— -that at the Assize in question, the number of 
these is to be 48 ; — and that in the first cause that stands on 
the roll, the twelve first of those that appear are to serve. In 
this state of things it is evident, that, if to this Attorney it 
should happen to find bis convenience, either in corrupting 
the requisite number of jurymen himself, (which might be 
attended with some danger) or in letting in another corrupter' 
upon them (which might be done without any danger) the 
regular practice will find itself altogether well adapted to the 
purpose. 

In this state of things, thus for illustration sake supposed, 
we see, in aid pf the practice of corruption, two auxiliary 
principles — viz. choice dinA foreknowledge^ confsderated. But 
even without the aid of choice^ Joreknowledge may very well 
be sufficient for the purpose. Suppose it settled, that in 
tht gross or total qualified list, the names shall be entered in 
the order of the alphabet : moreover, supposing the whole 
number in a given County 480, and 48 the number to serve 
on each Assize, that for the first Assize the 48 whose names 
stand first in the alphabetical list thus composed shall be 
summoned to attend ; for the next Assize, the next 48 ; and 
so on. On this plan, if pursued without deviation, it will 
not be in the power of the Sheriff (that is of the Attorney 
his Deputy) to choose a set of eventual jurymen for the pur- 
pose of their being corrupted ; but, what is worse, it will 
pe in the power of every litigant to whom the order of 
things in question is known to find his - way to those on 
whom he proposes to himself to make the experiment — to 
find his way to them of himself, and without th« need of 
being beholden for introduction to an Under Sheriff or any 
body else. ' 

Thus much as to juries in general — ^thus much as to com^ 
mon juries: thus much as to what, in that case, is capable of 



S40 Chap. I. Rtstore the Constitution as to Juries: 

having place ! As to what in that case actually has place it if 
X what it might take up too much room to state, and what at 

' this moment the means of enquiring into are not withiri 

my reach. 

As to the case of special jaries, what actually has place 
lies in a narrower compass, and at the same time within 
reach. In this case every thing that, for the furtherance of - 
corruption, by possibility could have been done, has been 
done : whether it be constant corruption, administered, and 
with certainty of success, by and for the benefit of persons 
in '• high situations'* as such, and without either risk or 
trouble on their part, as above— or occasional and casual 
corruption, to be on this or that occasion, administered, in 
his private and separate account, by this or that particular 
person, in or out of high situation^ to whom it niay hap- 
pen to stand in iteed ot such assistance. In the first place 
choice (as we have so often had occasion to observe) is put 
into their hands; viz. by the power of " nomination** vested 
in the hands of the Master Packer for that purpose. In the 
next place, among the comparatively small number 24, in 
the instance of which the choice is viadc, and attendance ac- 
cordingly commanded, " foreknowledge** is. rendered to the 
purpose in question** absolute:'* for out of these 24 who, 
as per list, are summoned, of those that appear, the twelve 
whose names stand first upon that same list, are the twelve 
that serve. 

For the furtherance of corruption, the utmost that could 
have been done having thus been actually done, to what 
cause, to what psychological cause, having its seat in the 
breasts of learned and reverend Lords and Gentlemen, shall 
the result be ascribed? To design? — it would be of a piece 
with all their other designs, and all their other doings. To 
imbecillity? On the. part of no other set of men would ira- 
becillity be to be found, weak and palpable enough to match 
with it." For note once more, that it was amid the cry of 
corruption — actually experienced and .acknowledged cor- 
ruption, that this state oF things, so exquisitely adapted to 
the purpose of that same corruption, was in and by this very 
statute (3 Geo. 2. c. 25.) part confirmed, part organized. 






941 

§ 9- Unanimity increases the Aid afforded to Corruption 

by Foreknowledge. 

By the principle of forced unanimity^ so long as that 
abomination is sufFered to continue, an enormous degree 
of facility, is already observed, is given to the corruption of 
jurors I since by any one of the twelve^ so that one be but 
sufficiently remunerated for the quantity of endurance he- 
cessary^ the suffrages of the remaining eleven may be forced. 
And though, in any given instance, as matters stand, it 
should not be capable of being foreknown to a certaint) 
that this or thai one individual will on the particular tria 
in question be upon the serving list — foreknown, vias. 
time enough for administering to him the matter of corrup- 
tion with effect, yet by gaining divers individuals, each of 
them likely to stand upon the serving listy the probability 
of success may in any degree be increased. 

Were that flagitious principle rooted out, and the principte 
which gives the power to a majority seated in its place, werti 
this done, even a slight admixture of chance (if it be too 
much to say the rational and honest principle- of itself, and 
without the help of chance,) would suffice to render corrup- 
tion in this shape morally impossible. If no number less 
than a majority, viz. less than seven out of twelve, were suf- 
ficient to command a verdict palpably unjust upon the face 
of it, no such verdict could be commanded without a com- 
pletely successful application of the matter of corruption to 
that large number. But, taking the state of morality among 
the people upon the worst fooling imaginable, the chance 
of finding, or creating on the sudden, so much depravity on 
the part of so large a number, and that out of a limited 
greater number, cannot but be extremely small : and, ere 
he could give himself that small chance, the corruptor ' 
would be under the necessity of putting it into the powet 
of each of the seven to ruin him, in character at least, h^ 
covering him with infamy. Such would be his difficulty, 
even supposing the twelve who afe to serve on the rlial, 
supposing them, all of them, in their turn, at and during 
the quantity of time that lies open to the intfigufe — all or 
them during all that lime to a certainty foreknown. And 
suppose such absolute foreknowledge unattainstble— suppose 
for example four-and-twenty^ the number of the gross list, 
of any of whom the twelve upon the setving list may hap- 
pen ta be composed^ it is easv to see that, to this our sup- 

\ 




242 Chap. I. Restore the Constitution as to Juries. 

posed corrupter, the probability of success, and at the same 
time the magnitude of the danger, must, in this case, re- 
ceive a prodigious increase : for, in this case, to give him 
the same assurance of success as in the former case, no 
smaller than nineteen is the number that would be necessary 
to be thus corrupted. 

But upon the principle of sham unanimity^ upon thU 
principle which gives the command of the verdict to any 
one, not only if all twelve were foreknown might the cor- 
ruptor, by the corruption of a single juryman, give himself 
a certainty of success, but if no. other knowledge were ob» 
tained, more determinate than that of \hQ four -and- twenty 
out of which the twelve would be taken, the same success, 
in the preparatory operation of corruption, would still give 
him tin even chance of succeeding in the ultimate object of 
the corruption, viz. the commanding of an unjust verdict: 
and, by every additional juryman whom he could contrive 
to gain, this even chance would receive a proportionable 
augmentation, until by the rising of the number of the cor* 
rupted to thirteen^ absolute certainty would even in this 
case be produced. 

Thus stands the matter upon the supposition of a gross 
list equal in number to twice the serving list : augment the 
relative number of the gross list, the difficulty of corrup- 
tion will it is evident be in )>oth cases increased ; and in 
" each case by an amount that might be ascertained, jsut is 
pot worth ascertaining for the present purpose. 

One thing will be evident, viz. that on the principle 
which gives the command of the verdict'to a majority out 
of twelve, under the most favourable circunastances in re- 
spect of the number of the gross list, corruption could 
never obtain a chance nearly equal to what, on the prin- 
ciple which gives the command of the verdict to any one 
corrupted juryman, it possesses under the circumstances 
least favourable in that ret^pect. Seventy -two is the greatest 
number that can in any county be returned and appear for 
the trial of all the causes that can at one and the same assise 
present themselves* : and even under so great a disadvan- 
tage, if the power be in a single juryman, the corruption, 
though it were but of a single man of the seventy-two, 
jgives the corrupter a chance of success, viz* as one to six* 
Whereas if the power be in the majority, though the num-

ber returned and appearing be no greater than the twelve 
who are necessary to serve, insomuch that all who are to 
«crve are foreknown, the corraptor niay have ^ined six^ 
or at least Jive^ without having as yet given himself any 
chance at all*. 

§ 10. Arrangements respecting Form : viz. The Form of 

the proposed new Law. 

For giving expression to the operations, which, .under 
this head, require, in my view of the matter, to be per- 
formed, a very few words will suffice. Presenting them- 
selves as requisite in relation to this part of the ficldof law, 
the mention of these operations could not, on this occa- 
sion, be omitted. But, in relation to this part of the field, 
the demand for these operations cannot te more urgent, 
nor the propriety of them more indisputable, than they afre 
in relation to every oifier part of the same as yet scarce cul- 
tivated waste. 

1. Consolidate into one act all lawf relative to Juries. 

2. Repeal in the lump the whole of the existing chao^. 

3. Place the whole of the rule of action on the footing 
of statute law. Of the practice of the several judicatories, 

* Fifteen hundred pounds I have heard mentioned as being, in one in* 
itanoe that happened not very long ago, the sum at the expense of which 
a verdict wasttotained. According to the report, it was a case of life and 
death : the cause being an indictment for murder, and the money given by 
the defendant. 'Vhe fact was mentioned to me as one that had become in a 
considerable degree notorious : but, having no means of forming any opinion 
concerning the truth of it, I forbear mentioning any further particulars, lest, 
the story being false, suspicion should by this means come to attach itself to 
this or that individual, in whose instance it would be injurious. 

Under the principle of forced or rather sham unanimity, it is easy to see 
what prodigious facility is given to a plan of corruption of this sort. Do 
what ynu will, (says the first corrupted juryman to the rest,] / am determined 
to stand you out. Stand you out till you are almost starved, you wiU get no' 
things and as you will find it necessary to yield at last, you will not succeed : 
Ji^r this generous man shall and tvill be acquitted in spite of your teeth. On the 
other hand, join with me in a verdict of acquittal at once, you shall have 50 1, 
apiece, and wi mvre injustice will he done, than would he done if you got no' 
iking : so that this 501, will be yowl's with a clear conscience. 

Supposing then this story to have any truth in it, I see not how, even with 
the force of tor:ure thus vested in his hapds by the principle of unanimity, 
the murderer, by the assistance of his learned friend or friends, could havd 
reflected his Uberatioa without some degree of Ibi'eknowtedge. Of some one 
fit person at least it must have been foreknown to him that he would have 
to serve upon this jury : foreknown of some one person, tnat after being 
himself corrupted, ne might be in a condition as trell as ia a situation to 
operate in the chstfacter of oomqitor upon hit colleagues.

On this head much stands expressed in a few words. 

Extract from an anonymous pamphlet published on the 
occasion of the Scotch Judiciary Reform, under the title of 
Reflections on the Administration of Civil Justice in Scot* 
land^ &c. : Edinburgh, for Blackwood ; London, for Long- 
man and Co. 1806. — Page 88, Note. 

** The mode of appouiting juries in criminal cases is 
most improper. The sheriff may return forty-five men 
chosen by him at pleasure ; the judge may select any fifteen 
of them to compose the jury ; peremptory challenges are 
unknown. Is it not obvious that these two officers have 
the fate of a prisoner often in their hands ? in other words, 
that they can return what is termed in England a packed 
jury ? Nothing should be left in criminal cases to the dis- 
cretion of persons over whom the crown is always likely 
to have influence ; and therefore it is much to be wished 
that a clause should be introduced in the bill, which is to 
be founded on the Resolutions^ in order to regulate the 
appointment of juries in criminal cases/' 

If, in the statement thus made by an anonymous though- 
not altogether an unknown hand, there be a syllable of 
truth — and by known, and well-informed and trust-worthy 
informants I am assured that it is correctly true — the 
packing system has in that kingdom been carrtod to a pitch 
of perfection equal in efficiency at least, if not in dexterity, 
to that which it has attained in England, and this not only 
where personal liberty alone, but where life and every thing 
else is at stake. If, in the whole population of thai; 
kingdom, electors and elected, there be a human being fit 
for any thing better than to serve as a tool in the chest 
belonging to Lord Melville^ or a commissioner in the com- 
mittee of reform, headed and characterized by that name^ 
behold an occasion ibr him to show himself.

CHAP. III. HaMBLE Proposal for restoring the 

Authority op Parliament. 

§ 1 , Unless the Authority of Parliament be vindicated^ 

Package cannot be abolished. 

I come now to the second of the political disorders here 
in question, viz. the contempt — ^the habitual and undis- 
guised contempt — manifested uy Judges and other subor- 
ainate functionaries as towards the authority of parliament : 
or rather (for in this consists the malignity of the disorder) 
the connivance — the habitual and unvaried connivance— 
by which this contempt has been encouraged and con- 
firmed. 

, On this head, a conception that will naturally present it- 
self to every body, and at the first glance, is — that the pre- 
sent is of the number of those occasions in which the 
difficulty consists — not so much in determining what it i» 
that is proper to be done, as in engaging men to do what 
18 proper to be done, whatsoever it may be. 

To the justness of this remark I can find nothing to 
oppose : accordingly, of the two following sections, the 
business of the first is — to do what can be done by so weak 
au instrument of communication as the present, towards 
holding up to view the flagrancy of the disease : of the 
other, to present to view and in a specific shape, what 
seems to t)e the proper remedy, penetrated all the while 
with the clearest and acutest sense^ of the minuteness of 
the chance in favour of its being applied. 

This, bitter as it is, is a cup which cannot be put by^ 
Package^ it is true, constitutes that particular abuse which 
is the object — the only direct object — of the present work. 
But so intimate is the connection'l)etween this disorder and 
that which consists in the habitual contempt of parliament, 
that while this radical weakness remains uncured, any re- 
m^edy that can be applied to \\\t derivative xx\'d\didy will either 
be from the very first inoperative, or at the very best will 
in a short time cease to operate. If the authority of Par- 
liament had not been set at nought by Judges, the package 
of Juries could not have been established^ much less as we 
have seen it, openly defended : and while Parliament oonr 
tinues> as it has done, to suffer its authority to be 'thus set 
at nought^ in vain would it endeavour to put an eiid to tbii 



246 Chap. III. Restore the Authority of Parliament. 

package; juries will^ as at present^ continue to be packed. 
To apply to this abuse the only possible remedy — I mean 
the only possible direct and spedaS remedy — it would be 
necessary that Parliament should make a fresh law ; but, 
if^ when the fresh law has been made. Judges continue de- 
termined to deal by it as Judges have done hitherto by the 
existing ones, viz. to disobey it, and Parliament to do as 
Parliament has done hitherto, viz. to sit still, and without 
a thought of giving effect to its authority, see itself dis- 
obeyed, the trouble of making fresh laws, under the notion 
of applying a remedy to the other abuse^ may as well be 
spared. 

§ 2. Contempt put upon the Bill of Rights y by the Lord 

Chief Baron* s Package. 

As to the statutes, which bear in detail upon the subject 
of juries, and even in respect of the clauses in question 
thought to bear upon special as well as common juries, 
these, it is true, were, on the occasion in question, by 
the learned judge more particularly in question, viz. the 
Lord CSiief Baron, violated in intention only, and not in 
effect : special juries having, by the fraud of the learned 
penman, been exempted, as we have seen*, from those pro* 
Vbions against corruption, the demand for which was so 
much more urgent in that instance than in the instance of 
common juries. 

But though, in the manner that has been se^, the con- 
tempt entertained by this pre-eminently learned person (not 
to speak at present of any othe|: pre-eminently learned per- 
sons) as towards the authority of Parliament, failed by ac* 
iptdent and by misconception to fall upon these statutes at 
which it was principally aimed, it fell, as we shall see,^ 
without accidenty upon another statute, I mean the statute 
commonly called the Bill of Rights f. 

On looking into this much vaunted law, and in parti- 
cular into those parts of it which bear upon the subject here 
in question, the weaknesses betrayed m it are seen to be 
such, as cannot be thought of without regret, the imbe- 
cility, if not the treachery of the learned penman, in whotn 
the unlearned found themselves, as usual, under the ne- 
cessity of reposing their confidence^ being, on the face of 

• PartU.^.;5. t IW.andML testes. c.2.« .

it, but too distinctly visible : propositions^of the cast termed 
by logicians identical^ fit only for the mouths and pens of 
drivellers : propositions, which neither conveying instruc- 
tion nor imposing obligation, leave every thing exactly as 
they find it : propositions declaring that what is right ought 
to be done, and what is wrong ought not to be done, and 
so forth. 

But this weakness, though to a lover of the English con- 
stitution it cannot but be matter of regret, will not, to the 
[>re-eminently learned person in question, afford any thing 
ike matter of excuse. For to this so much vaunted law— 
to this lawy as to every thing else that bears the name of 
law, some meaning must be found : and to this law, viz. 
in respect of that clause in it which is here in question, no 
sooner will any meaninjg be found, than what will also be 
found is — that by this preeminently learned person it has 
been violated. 

In the section in question (§ 2 ) two parts may be di- 
stinguished — the historical and the legislative. In the his- 
torical, the principal abuses of the then late reign are re- 
lated under twelve heads ; in the legislative, under an equal 
number of heads, the repetition of these same abuses is, 
to wit, by a declaration made of their illegality, reprobated. 

In the historical part, of the only article which touches 
upon jury trial, being the article which is numbered 9, the 
words are as follows — *^ 9. And whereas of late years par- 
tial, corrupt and unqualified persons have been returned and 
served on juries in trials (and particularly divers jurors in 
trials for high treason, which were not freeholders.)" 

In the legislative part, in the only article which touchei 
upon this same subject, being the article which is num- 
bered 1 1, the words are as follows — "11 • That jurors ought 
t6 he duly impanelled and returned, (and jurors which 

Eass upon men in trials for high- treason ought to be free- 
olders).'' : 

In each of these two articles, there is a clause which. does 
^of besir upon the present subject; viz. that which speaks 
of high treastm and freeholders hip. Of the clause which 
does bear upon this subject, it must once more be confessed 
that, if it he not sad treachery, it is sad dotage, — ** that 
jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned ; viz. that 
\Yhat in this case ought to be done, ought to be done. , 

In relation to the subject here in question, the law hav* 
ing thus in itself no meaning, to find a ixieaning for it wf 




£48 Chap. III. Restore the Authx>nty of Parliament* 

are sent to history— to the bistor)' of the times. Consult- 
ing history, a fact that we find in every book of history 
that touches upon those times, is^ — that in the two reigna 
then last preceding juries used to be packed: that is, that, 
instead of being left lo a mode of selection, which, with 
reference to the ccown, its dependent judges, and its other 
instruments, would have come under the name of accident 
ov chance y the persons servmg as jurors were^etermined by 
choice : viz. by the choice made of them by these same 
instruments. The choice having for its notorious object 
the causing unjust verdicts to be delivered, persons, who 
either of themselves were " partial^*' or were made so by 
being made *^ corrupt," were taken for the objects of such 

^ choice, and, if they were not Jbund so, were made so by 

^ that choice. 

That in the exact bulk to which it has been swollen, and 
in the exact shape into which it has been, by our pre-emi- 
nently learned artist, moulded, the abuse relative to juries 
was not in the contemplation of the framers of those clatises, 
must I think be confessed : perfection, such as this which 
we have seen realized by Lord Chief Baron Macdonald, 
outstripped — not only the observation made by the j(Way- 
nard's, the Somers\ the Hawles's, the PolLsxfeTi^s — but 
the most sanguine hopes of the Scraggs's and the Jefferies*s 
wi^th their Et cceieras of those times. 
.But what on the other side, cannot, it is supposed, be 
, \ very easily denied is — that, , in the majw abuse of these 

our maturer times, the minor abuse of those immature times 
is included. The abuse of those days was, that after hard 
labour, bestowed upon the matter on each separate occasion^ 
persons, who were found or rendered ^* corrupt" or in 
some other way 'i partial,'* were on great occasions, now" 
and then ^''returned'' and made to ^^ serve on juries in 
trials " The abuse of these days is — that under the ar- 
rangements made — made and in despite of remonstrance 
Persevered in — persevered in either for that purpose or for 
none at all, persons are on all occasions, great and small^ 
•• caused to be ^^ returned" and to ^^ serve " persons such as, 
* by the permanency with which they are invested, and the 
habitual, but ever withholdable bribes^ with which they ^rc 
fed, cannot but have been rendered " corrupt \" corrupt to 
a degree of corruption, of which, as surely as by any " par- 
tiality'* it could be made to be, injustice is, upon every 
4esired occasion^ the habitual consequence. 



§ S. L, C Baron's Contempt of the Bill of Rights. 24^ 

In vain would his Lordship say, — ^Those whom I have 
caused to be '^impanelled and, returned^''* — as you would 
say, 720^ " duly impanelled and returned^" — are not jurors : 
they are in effect commissioner s^ and members of a standing 
board of my own framing, — persons, whom, into the box 
which ought to have none in ii but jurors, I have so ma- 
naged as to introduce, under the name of jurors. Those 
whom you take for jurors — iho<ie whom I have thus " im^ 
panelled and returned*^ under- the name of jurors, are 720^ 
jurors ; and therefore, in causing them to be *^ impanelled 
and returnedj^* even though it should not be duly impa^ 
nelled and returned, I have not offended against the Bill of 
Rights. 

My intention was not to *^ maim and disfigure*' the man 
''■^my intention was to kill him : and therefore^ if you punish 
me as for maiming and disfiguring hint, you punish me 
without law. Such was the plea of a very ingenious as 
well as learned person, a Mr, Coke, who, on the Act of 
22 and 23 Car. I. c. 1. was indicted for the maiming and 
diifigurinff of a Mr. Crisp, What I am accused oj intend^ 
ing to do IS the committing the lesser crime : what I really 
ir^teoded to do is only a greater crime, in which the other t$ 
comprized. This plea did noi avail Mr. Coke, and as little, 
if there be any thing like justice in the country, will it 
avail the Right Honourable Sir Archibald Macdonald, 

But (says somebody) as one swallow suffices not to make 
summer, so one act suffices not to make a habit. What, 
ill this particular instance, was done, may not perhaps have 
been altogether justifiable; but, if for the express and sole 
purpose of correcting this error, so it should conie to pass, 
that a fresh law were made, can you, by this one instance 
of irregularity, hold yourself warranted in apprehending 
that a law so made would not be obeyed ? 

I answer, Yes: even by this one instance, the disobe- 
dience being so deliberately and determinately, and after 
8\ich warning dLud remonstrance, and upon such principles 
as have been avowed, persevered in. But, of the existence 
of the habit, and my expectation of the eventual conti- "• 
nuance of it, it is on this o?ie act alone that I ground my- 
self : and, to render it manifest, and beyond all possibility 
of dispute, that the contempt put upon parliament is rfe- 
termined, and rooted in a sort of principle, I proceed to 
bring to view, out of a countless multitude that might have 
been produced, another instance or two^ such as either 



f iO Chap. ni. Restore the Authority of Parliameni* 

the matter of the present inquiry, or chance recollection has 
happened to throw in my way, 

§ 3. Recent Contempt of Howard's Act by the Detention of 

acquitted Prisoners, 

To enumerate all the instances in which the symptoms 
of the disorder in question have exempli 6ed themselves^ 
would require a volume. Of the example which here fol- 
lows, the particular use is — to show the obstinacy of the 
disease: and it is only by casual symptoms, brought to 
light by rare occurrences, such as accident may not either 
bring to light or so much as give birth to, twice in half a 
century, that this quality in the disease can have been made 
manifest. In the books y the contempt — the simple coq<? 
tempt — may indeed be seen breaking out continually ; — ^but 
it is only by extra-judicial conversations or correspondences^ 
that the obstinacy of it could have been displayed in its ge-* 
nuine colours. 

By obstinacy on one part, energy on some other party 
and acting in an opposite direction, is implied. But in 
any court of judicature, on the occasion of a cause, no 
such energy ever has been known to be, or with any colour 
of reason could be expected to be, displayed. On the oc- 
casion of a cat^se, the only sort of person by whom any 
such quality as energy can in any direction be displayed, i^ 
an advocate. But, from the advocate, whose contention- 
is before and under the judge, not with and against the 
judge, it belongs not to the station of the judge to expe- 
rience anything like adverse energy. One common interest^i 
one and the same sinister interest, links them together in in- 
dissoluble bands. Accommodation to indolence, graiili^ 
cation to vengeance, unmerited reputation, sinister emolu- 
ment, lawless power, — whatsoever of all these good things 
the judge holds in possession, the advocate beholds in ex- 
pectancy. The weakness of the legislature constitutes the 
lawless power of the judge: and i\iQ present power of the 
judge is iht future power of the advocate. With the legis- 
lator his supposed superior, the judge never comes in con- 
tact : from the legislator he knows not what it is to expe- 
rience resistance. The legislator makes laws : and the 
judge, according as it happens to them to suit or thw^f( 
his views, gives effect or mefficiency to them, as he pleases^ 
In parliament, be his rebellion ever so flagrant, he beholds^ 



§ 3. HowtercPs Act contemned, jtcquit ted Prisoners detained. 

neither inspector nor denunciator^ much less an avenger : 
two sorts of men alone docs he behold there — admirers — 
ignorant and awe-struck admirers — or accomplices and 
abettors. 

Thus it is, that the king — I mean the king in parlia- 
ment — being sunk into a king-logy not only the great bull- 
frogs, but the meanest tadpole, views his humiliation with 
complacency, and beholds in it a source — an inexhaustible 
source — of power, impunity, and triumph for himself. 

Evidence of obstinacy in one quarter requires, as above, 
and supposes, energy ^ adverse energy, in another ; on the 
particular occasion here in question thus it is, that/ go- 
vernment being in this country in the state above described, 
the energy necessary on one side, and consequently all ma- 
nifestation of qbstinacy on the other, might have been 
wanting for any number of additional ages, had it not been 
for the till now unexampled union of public spirit and intre- 
pidity — well-directed public spirit and persevering intrepi- 
dity — in the person of Sir Richard Phillips, 

Materials I have none, over and above those which have 
already been laid before the public by himself: but in his 
work they stand mixed with other matter in abundance : 
and, for displaying their importance with relation to the 
design of the present work, observations have been found 
requisite, such as could riot have come, with equal pro- 
priety, from any person, by whose testimony thp facts 
themselves were furnished. 

In reglard to the degree of credit due to it, one very short 
observation may suffice. A twelvemonth and more has 
elapsed, since his statements on. this head have been piad^ 
public, and in all this time not a syllable of contradiction 
has appeared from any one of the official persons, whose 
conduct and language is here in question. — One of two 
things, either no contradiction could be given, or, in the 
style of the preeminently learned judge, to give it was not 
thought ** worth while,'' 

Judges publicly charged, and by a functionary, himself 
in " high," however subordinate ^' situation" — charged with 
disobedience — wilful disobedience, to parliament: and in 
t/teir estimation so trivial the imputation, and the opinion 
of its truth so Unproductive of all cause of uneasiness or 
apprehension to themselves, that whether it prevail or not 
is to them, and their feelings ^mditier of indifference. This 
being the state of judicature, in what a state is government ! 




552 Chap. ILL Restore the Authority of Parliameni. 

The case that gave occasion to this disp]ay is as follows: 

By the Statute 14 Geo. III. c. 20. § 1. as copied by Sit 
Richard Phillips, it is enacted, " That every prisoner charged 
** with any crime, or as an accessary thereto, against whom 
*' no bill of indictment shall be found by the grand jury^ 
^* shall be IMMEDIATELY set at large, in open courti 
*' without the payment of any fee, &c." * 

Of an enactment thus clear and explicit, the habitual 
violation is in a Memorial addressed to the Recorder of 
London, couched in the most respectful terms, dated the 
8d of November 1807, and presented in the names and 
with the concurrence of both the Sheriffs ; presented to the 
notice of that learned Judge on the 3d of November I807«. 
For eleven days no answer. On the 14th of the month, (no 
answer yet received,) follows in the form of a note, an ad- 
dress from Mr. Sheriff Phillips alone^ to the same learned 
gentleman, for the declared purpose, indeed, of ^^ reminds 
tng him*' of the above paper, but again in the most cordial 
as well as uniformly respectful terms. 

The season of delay was now past : now comes the sea- 
son o^ promptitude J at least, if not of prm/)i/a/ ion. 

A few hours brought to Sir Richard an answer, froni 
which, what belongs indispensably to the present purpose^ 
(not to touch upon matter JForeign to it) the following is an 
extract : 

*^ As the con}mission of gaol delivery at the Old Bailey 
" is constituted of the highest, and of all the law autho- 
** rities in the kingdom, the twelve Judges of Elngland, the 
^* whole magistracy of the city, besides other great and re- 
" spectable names therein, Mr. Phillips, upon consideration^ 
** will surely see how indecorous it would be in the Recorder 
^^ of London to discuss and argue of the power, authority^ 
*' and practice of that Court, with one of the Sheriffs, who^ 
'* however privately esteemedand regarded by the Recorder, 
** is, with respect to that commission, but an officer and 
*' minister of the Court." 

Business, at least where the public has an interest in it, 
does not, we shall see, linger with Sir Richard Phillips. Not 
after an interval of eleven days, but on that same day, iti 
reply goes another note from him to the same learned 
Judge, always in the same style of unvarying respect, but 
expressing " his earnest hope*' that the necessary measunst 

• Phillips, pp. 62 to 68. 



§ 3, How(tr(fsjict contemned. Acquitted Prisoners detained* 

would be taken for paying obedience to the law ; aiid stating 
amongst other matters, ^^ that he understood, in a late 
{* conversation with Lord Ellenlorough on tliis very sub- 
^* ject, that points of practice in the Old Bailey Court rest 
" chiefly, if not entirely, vvith the Recorder^ as the law 
** officer of the corporation.'* 

Thus, had it depended upon Mr. Recorder, would have 
ended the whole business. Fortunately *' within a few 
«* weeks after," the Sheriff, as he tells us, " had an op* 
" portunity of pressing the subject again on the notice of 
**.lhe Recorder, when (continues he) he peremptorily told 
*' me, that he nev^ would consent to the alteration in the 
f* practice of the Court which I proposed,, and as long as 
*' he lived it should continue as it is.*' 

Thus tar Sir Richard Phillips. As to Mr. Recorder of 
JLiOndon, for my own part, if, with any propriety, I can 
be said to have any personal acquaintance at all with that 
learned Judge, it is of no other sort than what, as towards 
him, would tend to cherish in my mind those sentiments 
of respect and regard which were so uniforiTily manifested 
towards him by Sir Richard Phillips. 

But, though a very obscure and insignificant person, I 
have the honour to be a British subject. I say suvject : foe 
on that ground, rather than on so technical and narrow 
an one as that of freeholder ship ^ do I choose to rest my 
claim. I am a British subject; and, in that character, I 
feel as strong an interest in the preservation of the English 
constitution, as any one can feel in the preservation^ or 
^ even in the destruction of it. And, in consideration of this 
interest it is, that it seems proper for me to declare — that, 
although instead of being thai great person to whom, by 
the description of points of practice^ this part of the liber- 
lies of Englishmen is, it seems, ^* bargained, assigned, 
•* transferred^ and set over," by the twelve Judges, he 
were my brother, my opinion conceniing him would still 
be this, viz, that iF it really were the case, that the con- 
tinuance of the practice depended upon his life, the last 
day of that life would to his country be a most happy one. 
A conspiracy qf the twelve Judges^ with the Recorder of 
London at their head, (for such it seems is the new order 
of things) — a conspiracy of the twelve Judges with their 
Hngleader the Recorder, for mending the constitution of 
the country, by resisting, over-ruling, and treating with 
avowed contempt, the authority of parliament !-^uch is 



254 Chsqp. III. Restore Ike AtUkority of ParlicPmenL 

the state of things, brought to view by this evidence. Such 
is the state of things which I would wish to recommend to 
the consideration, the serious considemtion — df all such 
British subjects, if any such there be, in whose eyes thf«f 
preservation of the constitution of the country is of mor^ 
value than any share which in the character of lawyers, of 
confederates with lawyers, it may happen to them to look 
for in the plunder of it. *' , 

^* Mr. Phillips,, upon consideration, will surely see ho^ 
'* indecorous it would be in the Recorder of London todts* 
*^ cuss and argue of the power, authority, and practice of 
*' that Court with one of the Sheriffs^ who is but an oQicer 
*^ and minister of the Court." No, if in any such argu^ 
ment Mr. Phillips could have seen any thing indecorous^ 
his view of the matter would, I will confess, have been 
very different from mine. 

Indecorum in arguing, in relation to the point in question^ 
the practice of the Court? No: — ^but something a. great 
deal worse then indecorum^ iti the determination, the ob^ 
stinate and rebellious determination — to continue in such 
practice. 

The House of Commons — yes, the House of Commons— 
there is the place^ at which the discussion on this .ques- 
tion should now be carried on. As id argument, of argu^ 
went — of further discoursej unless what as above is stated 
to have been his language, be not only in tenor but in pur- 
port denied to have been so — of further discourse, in any 
shape, on the part of the learned gentleman, there is no 
need '.-^hearing is for him the only ulterior function need- 
ful : hearings his functioUy genjiflection his proper posture, 
for the performance of it. 

The inhumanity of the practice, its rank and bare-faced 
injustice, the oppression thus heaped — heaped upon injured 
and established innocence — the contrast it makes with their 
principle of nullification — the instrument manufactured by 
their partnership for dealing out impunity at their own 
pleasure, aud their own price — for dealing it out, liot to 
merely possible only, but to convicted guilt* — all these 
are subjects which must for the present be discarded, as 
being foreign to the design of the present work, as well as 
of the present chapter. The subject which alone belongs 
to the present purpose is the subversion of constitutionkl

order — the contempt — the wilful, the deliberate, the con- 
federated contempt— of that supreme power, the supremacy 
of which is in words acknowledged, and in grimace bowed 
down to, even by themselves. — Alas ! by what terms can 
8uch enormity be expressed? The very language sinks 
linderit*! 

♦ Incomprehensible as this pertinacity may appear on the face of it, the 
root of it may, I have been led to think, be traced to certain extortions that, 
so long" ago as in the year 1777, were brought to light by Howard. 'I'he 
principal passages, extracted from liis ^* State of the Prisons; &c.'* 3d Edi- 
tion, Atffio 1784, pp. 15 and 16, are here subjoiiied. Between the extor- 
tions of that day as exhibited by Howard, and one of the oppressious of the 
present day ss exhibited by Sir Richard Phillips, evidence of connection 
having been observed, the display of it was at one time destined to form 
part of the present work: but the length of it being found altogether dis- 
proportionate, it has been necessarily discarded for the present } though on 
toxne future occasion it may perhaps find its place. 

Including some remarks on the abovementioncd Statute, (14 Geo. III. c. 20) 
ta which Howard will be set-n to allude, being one. of the feebly-protecting 
Itatutes to which the ill-seconded exertions of that truly Christian heio gave 
birth, the deduction would be found to present a curious-enough picture of 
parUamenlary and super-'parlidinfntary lawyer-craft, forming no unsuitable 
match with that which stands exhibited in the 5th chapter of the second 
part of this work. 

< Although acquitted prisoners are by the late Act in their favour (14 

< Geo. III.) cleared of gaolers' fees, they are still (says he) subject to a similar 
^ demand made by the clerks n/assvu and eUrks of the peace, and detained in 

* prison several days after their acquittal : at assize till the judges ; at quarter 
^ sessions till the justices of peace, leave the town ; in order to obtain those 

* fees, which the gentlemen say are sot cancelled by the Act. And yet the 

* exjH'ess words of it are, ** ^quitted prisotiers shall be immediately set at Imjgt 
' in open court.** It is evident then that all fees of the commitment in respect 
' of the prisoner, are by this Act totally abolished. 

• Since the said Act, the clerks of assize in some circuits have started a new 

* demand upon the gaoler, for the judge's certificate of acquitment : viz. six 
' shillings and eight-pence for the nrst prisoner acquitted ; and a shilling for 

* each of the rest, or two shillings for every one. I have copies of two re- 
' ceipts given by the clerk of the Western circuit to the gaolers of Exeter and 

< Salisbury. One of them is as follows : *^ Received 1 April 1775 of Mr. 

* " Sherry, gac^cr, one pound eight shillings and eight-pence, for his certifi- 

* " cate entitling him to his gaol fees for the county of Devon, from J. F****, 

* " clerk ©f the assize." The gaoler told me this was for twenty-three ac- 

* quitted prisoners. 

' I was informed at Durham, that judge Gould, at the assizes of 1775, laid 
^ zjine of fifty pounds on the gaoler /or detaining some acquitted prisoners for 

< fees of the clerk of assize. But upon^the intercession of the Bishop, (pro- 

< prietor of the gaol) the fine was remitted ; and the prisoners set at large ; 

* the judge ordering the clerk of assize to explain to him in London, the foun- 

* dation for this demand. * 

*• One pretence for detaining acquitted prisoners is, that '* It is possible 

< other indictments may be laid against them before the judge loaves the 

< town." I call it a pretence, as the grand jury are often diamis^ some days 

< before that time, and because those who do satisfy the demands of the clerk 

< of assize are immediately discharged. Another pretence is, the goaier tells 
( you <* he takes them back to knock off their irons." But this may be done

§ 4. Parliamentary Operations proposed. 

Under this head, a few short and compressed hints arc 
us much as, iFnot more than, will be found " indurahley* 
especially, under the Perceval dynasty, from a self-created 
censor, who has neither a coronet in his pedigree, nof so 
much as a place in the red hook. 

I. Committee of Inquiry^ to collect and report the facts. 

Subject of inquiry, cases of disobedience to Acts of par- 
liament on the part of persons concerned in the administra-- 
tion of' justice; limitation necessary, at least in the first in- 
stance, confining the remark to such cases in which mis- 
conception was impossible. No fear, that by this restric- 
tion the work would be left without materials to operate 
upon. tViihovt such restriction the work would have no 
end. 

To render the import of the Restriction clear^ an example 
or two will suffice. Cases which have more or less of 
arithmetic \vi them will in general be found to affoix) the 
clearest samples. 

1. One such has been brought to view already. Law^ 
prohibiting the giving, On such or such an occasion, to a 
person of such or such a description, money to the amount 
of more than one guinea. Official transgression^ on an oc- 
casion of that same description, to a person of that same 
description, sum given, two guineas. See above, Part III. 

d. LaWj in a case therein described, giving to the suc- 
cessful party double costs : — official transgression — and here 
the o^ce is judicial'^ ^w'mg, and that avowedly, instead 
of the double costs, single co&ts with an addition of only 
Aa// single costs. Acts of parliament upon which con- 
tempt h^s been poured in this shape are to be found in 
•warms^ they are pointed out by the indexes. 

* in court : m London they have an engine or blo,ck, by the help of ^hich 

* they take oflf the irons with ease in a minute ; the machine is brought into 

* court, and the acquitted prisoner is- immediate!]^ discharged. If, according^' 

* to wiiat I proposed, prisoners were tried out of irons, tins pretext would be' 

* entirely removed. 

• Oerks of assize, and of the peace, ought most certainly to have a consi- 

* deration for their service to the public ; the thiifg 1 complain of is what ¥ 

* am led to by my subject, that is^ the demand that is made directly or indi- ' 

* rectly upon acquitted prisoners *. 

* ♦ The clerks of assize give to the judge, large sums for their places. One 

* of the present gentlemen gave for his place 2,500/. On manv accounts these 
< places ought not to be Bfmfshl of the judges. If they were oaly prfstnted, (he 

* feet might be much lower. *

be done? '■■ . 

, 'iThe least that can be done is for the House (I suppose

• condemning the priictice< and denouncing eventual punish- 
.Bdent in future. Happily this House, in conjunction with. 

'the other, possesses, in the right of addressing the king for 
repioval, a virtual power altogether adequate to the purpose. 
Resolved, that' in case of any^ misinierpreiatio7i put frbm

mhidgesy should such interpretation be deeined wilful, Mfe 
House will address his majesty \t praying the removal of smch 
Judge or Judges. After wilful add, if necessary, and not 
proceeding from error in judgement merely. Somethings to 
this effect may serve as a sample. But to fix the meaning, 
and save it, if possible, from being explained away, ^ an exi- 
aBdfjle or two, as above, if the law of the Medm and Per^ 
sians would admit of any such innovation, might he of Use. 
As to retrospection'xxx any shapcyon this question victory 
must^ for any part I shall presume to take, be left as a 
prize to eloquence. Honourable' gentlemen, according to 
'whose theory bulls XskQ a pleasure in being baited^ may try 
'it jx\i6n Judges, 

Jf the measure they ^o freely mete to others *, were to 
be meted to them again (I speak of Judges), the question 
would be decided, and the benches cleared. But, in my 
own view of the matter, this measure, being in every ap- 
plication that can be made of it, a most false and mis** 
tjhievous oiie, it depends not upon them, by any use they 

<iau make of it, to make it otherwise.

the twelve Judges and the Chaoo^lor — acling respectively 
in one or other of their many and various sphere»---belongs 
the interpretation — the uncensurahle as well as unappeala- 
ble, jsnd thence the absolute. and uncontrollable interprcta- 
uonr— of whatsoever goes by the naaie of law : viz. not 
only of that spurious sort of law, which, by the oscitantcy 
of parliaments they have been suffered to make — to make 
of themselves and for themselves — but also of that only 
genuine sort of law, which is made by parliament. 

In certain cases indeed, but in certain cases only, the 
transaction being, in some shape or other, capable of boif^ 
brought before the House of Lords, the conduct of these 
pfBxri^ lawyers may to some purposes be weighed by other 
bfinds, be weighed by non-learned hands, fiut, forasmuch 
^ where any judicatory composed of any one or mon^ of 
these thirteen potentates i^ in question, every idea of ceH' 
sure is excluded ; reversal^ or modificatum of the judicial 
transaction, is the only purpose to which revision is con- 
sidered as capable of bem^ performed : and though, in 
point of right, non-learnea Lords cannot, on these, any 
more than on any other occasions, be avowSdly debarred 
either from speech or vote, yet, in iptnni of ^ness andpro^ 
triety, the very appellation thus iucontrovertibly applica^ 
ole to them, suffices to indicate, how incongruous, on these 
occasions, any interposition from so weak a quarter would 
be deemed— if not for the purpose of reversal or modifieetion 
of (be interpretation itself, at any rate for any such purpose 
as that of censure to be passed on the interpreters. 

In the putting of any such interpretation, being still but 
men, (for this concession, such is their candour and bumL- 
lity, they may be depended upon for making) — in the put- 
ting of any such interpretation they are liable to fall into 
error : but, he that error what it may, at least so as oom- 
petency of jurisdiction be out of dispute, it. never can be 
so much as censurable, much less punishable* 

Now in this I cannot but behold a doctrine, against 
which, had I a hundred hands, I would protest with all 
of them, as being inconsistent with all government. Admit 
this, parliament is but a. tool — a eortupt as well as a blind 
and passive tool — in the hands of lawyers ^nd their confe- 
derates. Admit but this, transgression will be beaped upon 
transgression, till the whole power of the country, and 
with It, in due season, the whole property of the country^^ 
will be avowedly in their hands i admit but this^ sooner oi-

never any thing to fear, they have still every thing to hope, 
or rather to make sure of.

.§ 6. No fresh Acts requiring Obedience to existing ones. 

But above all things let us have no fresh law: I mean, 
for the mere purpose of causing the existing ones to be 
obeyed: no enacting or re-enacting statute; still less a. 
Declaratory act. 

A declaratory Act ?-7-Observe the consequ^snces. A false- 
hood committed : the supremacy of ttie king in parliameut 
abdicated, surrendered: surrendered to the lawyers ; and on. 
so easy a condition— ^^o them of all mankind so easy— *as 
the employing false pretences in the exercise of it : pre- 
tending to have had ^< doubts/* where it is impossible they 
should have had any :— pretending to have put upon a word 
^: meaning, 'which it is impossible they should have put 
upon it.

what? whether immediately means immediately? Are law-

are all but lawyers ignorant of.it? After this first falsehood 
-T-^ommitted by parliament itseli— after this falsehood, and 
b^ oieans of it comes the abdication^^ht surrender — and 
the endless train of falsehoods — -falsehoods bespoken of 
judges, by an order so clearly given, and which with such 
resulaf alacrity would be executed.

the point to the Uwycw, to confirm the usurpation tn6teet<fi 
of checking it. It would be allowing them the very nef(tt^, 
live in question : the negative which| without as yet dmnff^ 
to claim it, they have been exercishig : a negative, whtcb- 
they want bui this allowance to exercise at pleasure^ and* 
at any time, upon all Acts. 1 ake at pleasure any one fv^ 
ture Act : the negative having (suppose) been exercised- 
upon ' that Act, the worst that could happen would be on- 
other Act ; which Act when passed would be just as com*'! 
pletely subject to their negative, m its predecessor was't 
and so toties quoties. By every such Act the uncertain ty^-^M 
*^ the glorious uncertainty of the law" — wrtuld receive* 
fresh confirmation', and, if possible, fresh increa^d: the 
uncertainty of the law and the certainty of raon, to ever/ 
man, not above the common ranks of life, who with the- 
words of it before him, should be ill enough advised to* 
ascribe any thing like cer/aiw/y to it. .. .-. 

Taking cognizance of a murder, and inflicting punish- 
ment according! v, the Judges of the Common Pleas, acting 
as such, would themselves be murderers, and as such 
punishable. This is what our men of law themselves have 
not scrupled to declare*. Why? because in this pureljT' 
ideal cas^^ if 'the authors- of the transgression are lawyers^' 
so are they also who are to judge of it and to punish it. * 

Here then is a transgression on which, according to 
their own doctrine, punishment may attach, even though- 
the transgressor be a Judge, acting in his character of 
Judge. 

AIlo\V then, (says a loyal subject to these disloyal usurp-« 
ers,) allow then, that where the law transgressed by you it« 
a law of the King's making — made by the King in parli*-". 
met>t — allow that in that case, if, to the conviction of 
every man that sees the words of the law, your transgres^i-: 
sion has been a completely wilful one, you ai^ not exempt 
from punishment, — allow but this, this is all we want of' 
you.- What we do not want is — to see you in any such 
posture, as that which, in the case of your own puttine^ ' 
you would figure in. But what we do want to see you \i^ 
18 — a kneeling posture, if not literally, at least figuratively : 
kneeling, like one of king James's parliaments, '^ upon the^

The constiiution, in short, is already at an end, and the 
government a mere tyranny in the hands of the Judges, if, 
to save tbem harrnless against the: punishment due for a 
transgression committed by them against the !aw, it be suf- 
ficient to them in all cases, or even in any case, to say 
such is the construction that we put upon it : if, in the in- 
stance of this as of every other set of men, for the purpose 
of ccmdeiDning them and if guilty punishing them,- it be 
not to wjhatcver authority it belongs to sit in judgement on 
thrir conduct, competent, if so it appear, to pronounce 
that the allegation, expresLs or implied, of their having be- 
lieved such and stich to have been, on the occasion in ques- 
tion^ the intention of the legislafure, is not true. 

To .the nueaiiest subject that is to be found — to him on 
whose part, not only in relation to the particular import, 
but in relation to the very existej^ce of the law in question, 
ignorance is at the same time most certain and most ex- 
cusable, such ignorance affords not. in the breast of those 
arbiters of his fate either ;//.y///fca/7*ort or so much as excuse* : 
and by the mere supposition of it, and that an untrue one, 
shall such ignorance afford not only excuse but justtjica^ 
tion to those in whose, situation, even without other trans- 
gression, such ignorance — ignorance of the law — is itself 
a crime ? 

. No : — neither on this nor on any other occasion : no ; 
on no, occasion, nor on any account, on the part of learned 

Ssntlemen will there be any objection to fresh Acts. Fresh 
cts, besides evidencing, on an occasion such as this, the 
impotency of the authority that made the former ones, make, 
on every occasion, fresh confusion^ and fresh fees. Fresh 
Acts make the pot boil brisk in the little kitchen of the at- 
torney : fresii Acts make the cauldron boil brisk in the great 
.victualling offices attached to higher ^6?^^ as well sls fee-fed 
situation s.-^No : — on any occasion there will not, on the 
part of lawyers in gpneraly be any more objection to fresh 
,Acts than on a particular occasion there was, on the part of 
hard Metmlle^ to the bringing ni, and carrying into a law, 
a bill for preventing a paymaster of the navy from applying 
the money of the people to his own use* On these sub-

far as the /raWing and punishing force of the laws bears 
upon men who neither are in power y nor are to receive prO'* 
iectioii from men in power, so far they are to be executed: 
so far as they would bear hard upon men who are in power^ 
or under the protection of men in power, so far they are to 
be laughed at.

Bacon, who started the question, talked about it and about 
it, but it was reserved for his successors to give a clearer 
answer to it. What is now the use of the law ? — to fall as 
a millstone upon the heads of " tinmen,*' to stand as a 
laughing-stock to " great characters.'* 

§ 7. Prospect of Redress. 

Butf these remedies of yourSy hy what hands are they to 
le administered P — Lawyers P You willjind none willing : 
non- lawyers ? You will jwid none able .... And when all 
lawyers and all non-lawyers are substracted, how many 
have you left ? 

I answer — to the difficulty of this remedy no eye can be 
more acutely or profoundly sensible than his are who thus 
ventures to propose it. But, under favour of the. inex- 
haustible stock of varieties incident to the human charac* 
ter, causes of a psychological nature, inscrutable to human 
eyes, have manifested, now and then, their power, in the 
production not only oi evil but oi good\ yea, and will con- 
tinue to do so little by little : of ^ood, in whatsoever, shapfc, 
good is at the same time conceivable, and in a physical 
sense, practical^le. In one age, A proposes : in another, 
B moves : in a third, C carries into effect. This is the rate 
at which Reform and Improvement travel, when the 5«»^ 
veyoTs of the Highways are Lawyers. 

Assuredly had it been my lot to find myself in the place 
y^htxt motions are made, some five and-twenty or thirty

lnaJs, and there you may see — ^not a parliament in which 
you may not see— a Committee of Justice. In that platee 
you may see it : but in that place you may as well content 
yourself with seeing it: for, until something which tvmdi 
be called confusion^ take the place of that which is called 
ordeVf you had better not expect, unless you are fond of 
disappointment, to see it any where else. 

Regular as is the appointment of this regular committee, 
the functions of it compose a sinecure : a sinecure no less 
regular and profound than if the Perceval allowance ot* 
38,574/. a year, (reduced, alas! to less than 13,000/. we 
apfe told, l>y deductions that somebody or other knows of*,) 
were attached to the situation of each of its members, in 
recompense for the labour of receiving the emoluments, 
added to that of being said^ without being so much as sup" 
posed to do the duties of it. 

But when sinecures are gone. Justice^ with the Commit- 
tees necessary for her restoration, may then come. 

Such is the state of things at present. Such will Con- 
tinue to be the state of things, until, in some shape op 
other, censure — prompt as well as impartial censure— not 
to speak of punishment — ^shall take place of tardy and dis-^ 
regarded laws :— of declaratory Acts, and explanatory Acts, 
passed some score or some half hundred years after the Acts, 
those Acts that wanted not to be explained but to be en- 
forced^ had, instead of being enforced, been trampled on 
by *^ great characters^*' or explained, and explained away, 
or what is shorter, openly scorned and trampled upon by 
Judges. 

PvRetlier law or tyranny reigns^ is a question that will 
be decided by the notice or no notice taken in '^ high situa- 
tionSj' and eventually in low ones, of this grievance. Till 
DOW, the tyranny had a mask : but now the mask is gone. 

Great zeal every where for the maintenance oisubordina- 
iion. Subordination? — But of what sort?-— Not of that 
of which universal security is the fruit : but of that, by 
which, for the benefit of " great characters in high sttua^ 
tions," all but they, their confederates instruments and 
dependents, are kept in a continual state of insecurity and 
bondage.

864 Proposal Jbr a Court of Lords* JDelegates. 

Observing the House of Lords to have at length^ by tb«f 
continually increasing accumulation of causes, become, iti 
respect of its appellate, jurisdiction, converted into a sort of 
delay-shop, in which in pieces of an indefinite number of 
years' length, delay is sold to dishonest men with other 
men's money in their pQckets, — observing, moreover, the 
grievance to be to such a degree flagrant and notorious, a»' 
to have been publicly and repeatedly held up to view, in the 
house itself, by the only persons by whom any plan of re- 
lief, it is universally understood, could, with any prospect 
of success, or, according to. received notions, with any sort 
of congruity, be laid upon the table — in the month of Ja- 
nuary 1808, I took upon me; to transmit to such of the 
members of both houses as could conveniently be reached, 
the outline of a plan, (accompanied in every article with 
reasons,) which I had sketched out for that purpose, under 
the title of a ^^ Plan of a Judicatory, under the name of 
The Court of Lords* Delegates." 

In my own* mind a still more important, though not an 
inseparable, part of that plan, consisted in the transferring- 
moreover to the proposed judicatory that part of the im- 
mediate jurisdiction of the House of Lords which con- 
sists in the cognizance of hnpcachmevts : the decision o£ 
the delegates in those cases to be final^ unless reversed or 
modified by the houhe at large, on the declared ground of 
censurable misconduct on the part of those their delegates. 

The main principle, on which this plan was grounded, 
was no other than that which, whether ever expressed or 
no in words,- w IH in substance be found to have served a& 
the main principle of the Grenvilte Act : viz. that the sense 
of responsibility, without which there can be no tolerably 
adequate security either for probity or intelligence, is less 
and less acute and operative, in proportion as the number 
of those whose share in it is extensive. 

It was at this price only, as it seemed to me, that im^ 
peachmevt, already proclainiC5d in parliament as having sunk 
into an cmptv name, could be restored to that character 
which it was originally designed, and till of la*e was uni^ 
versally supposed to j)0ssess, and which at different times^ 
it has in some degree possessed, viz. that of serving as a 
check upon political deliaquency in ** high sitttatious ;" 
and this, without consun)ing m judicatiirf' any part of that 
time which is so habitually iound insuflicient tor the still 
higher and more important fiuictions of legislation : to the 



Proposal for a Court of Lords* Delegates. i9s 

end tTiat the judicial aathorily of the country might upon 
occasion be employed in checking;, removing^ ana in case 
of need even punishing^ instead of being, as at present, ex- 
clusively and avowedly employed in protecting " unfitness** 
on the part of ^^ great characters*' in high " situations^:*' 
prmishmeni being reserved for such low people as, having 
the misfortune of sufFerinff from such ^^ unfitness," have 
the audacity to complain ot it. 

Of a censorial tribunal so constituted, what did not pre- 
sent itself to my view as the least important use, was — 
the application of a check to that corrupt despotism, to 
which, as above, except in name and empty show, there 
exists not at present any check, viz. the cfespotism of the 
Judges. 

Not only in my own mind, but in my own papers, the 
plan had in it yet otiier parts, the object of which was to 
invest the Lords, by the mstrumentality of these their ap- 
pointed and periodically removable delegates, not only with 
the power, but with the interest^ (without which power is 
nothinff) that seemed necessary to engatie and fix them in 
the habit of rendering to the community certain services 
which, by the necessary chanc^eablcness of its composition, 
the House of Commons is disabled from rcnderino; with 
equally assured steadiness and perseverance : one of these 
services being the instituting and keeping up an uninterrupt- 
edly periodical series of n.Uurns and accounts, expressive of 
the state of the system of judicial procedure, under a set of* 
preappointed heads, embracing the whole field of judica- 
ture, and bearing specific reierencc to the several distin- 
guishable e?ids of' justice: the other, the taking occasion of 
such causes a? should come before this judicatory in thci 
w^y of appeal, to facilitate the gradual conversion of the 
7'Ule of action, out of the purely conjectural, tenor less, 
uucognoscible, and impostrous state oi unwritten, alias com- 
mon law — the shapeless production of a set of note- takers, 
compilers, and publishing booksellers — into its onlv cog- 
noscible, deteruiinate and unimpostrous state, viz. that of 
whkt is called written or statute law : the joint and genuine 
work of the king, the lords, and the delegates of the people. 

For such plan, no efficient acceptance could either be

essential branch of the constitution were exposed to any 
. danger of being lessened : but that no such danger could, 
attach upon it, could easfiiy^ and would have been actuallyy 
put out of doubt. 

That, in the opinion of leading persons of opposite par- 
ties, the above plan (meaning of course such part of it as 
bad in the above paper been presented to view) possessed a 
claim to serious attention^ was a fact of which I found 
reason to make no doubt : and, on one part, such and so 
public was the opinion expressed concerning it, as to render 
It evident that in one event, nor that altogether an impro- 
bable one, should the same opinion continue to be enter- 
tained of it, the establishment of it would be but a natural . 
consequence. 

Haa the expression of such opinion been in any instance 
addressed to, or accompanied with any such intimation aft 
that of a desire that it should be, or a thought that it would 
be, communicated to the person whose proposal was the 
subject of it, the communication might have neen ascriba- 
ble to that sort of civility, from which any serious thought 
about the matter is not always to be inferred : but the com- 
munication having in every instance been the result of mere 
accident clear of all design, and probably to this hour not , 
merely unheeded but unknown, the real existence of the 
opinion is in each instance but so much the less exposed to 
doubt. 

In one instance my satisfaction would, T must confess, 
bave been more entire, if, when reflecting on past occur- 
rences, it had been in my power to assure myself that that 
part of the plan which by the author had been regarded as 
a drawback^' though that an indispensable one, from the 
mass of advantage expected from the institution, had not 
in other eyes constituted ai least a principal recommendation 
of it. 

But among those who are agreed about measures, it would 
be not only a useless but a pernicious refinement to look 
out for difierences about motives. 

Nor would any such topic have been touched upon, but 
that regarding the proposed institution, as above, as ca- 
pable' of operating ill the. character of a highly useful, if 
not of itself a completely effectual remedy, to the political 
disease of which so much has just been said, the design of 
this work seemed to requiie, that of the plan in question 
€uch part as has already i»een the light should now receive 



Proposal for a Court of Lords* Delegates. 967 

the same degree of publication as this work itself does ; for 
which purpose^ copies of it have now been transmitted to 
the publishers. 

Of this increased publicity one consequence is— >that in 
the mind of him by whom the ob^rvation shall have been 
made^ (and by whom will the observation not have beea 
made ?) thai a necessary part of the plan consists in the 
creation of several new situations, of which some could not 
but be in a preeminent d^ree Iticraiive ones^ a supposition 
too natural not tQ follow m a manner of course will be, 
that in this proposed mass of emolument some share had 
been looked for by the projector : and that, in his mind^ 
it was the advantage so looked for that had constituted— if 
not the sole^ at least one, final cause— of the project. It 
therefore, as mankind are constituted^ appears to me to be, 
if not absolutely necessary, at any rate highly conducive, to 
the unbiassed examination of the plan» to declare^ at I do 
most distinctly, that in any emolument that ever was pro^ 
posed or may ever come to be attached to it, I never had^ 
nor ever shall I have any more concern, than any other 
person under whose eye the present page may be lying at 
this moment : and that, in the contrivance of it, no person 
by whom for himself or any friend of his any expectation 
of any part in such emolument could have been entertained 
has ever been consulted with : no person having been in 
fact consulted with upon the subject,, either before the paper 
went ioto circulation as above, or since. 

Not that the plan is in itself awhit the better, or the less 
bad, for a circumstance thus collateral and accidental to it : 
and should any plan for the same purpose ever be brought 
on the carpet oy any other hand, the author may be assured 
that no personal advantage that may be found included in 
it for his own particular benefit, or that of any of his friends, 
will by me be pleaded in bar to the acceptance of it. In 
my view of the matter, be the measure what it may, instead 
01 a lar, any advantage accruing to an individual, consti- 
tutes, I must confess, a plea in favour of it. The indica- 
tion of any such advantage coupled with the appellation of 
2LJolf — this argument, as it is a very easy and a very com- 
mon^ so is it a very commodious argument for such poli- 
ticians as being conscious of their inability to form any 
direct and specific estimate of the advants^es and disadvan- 
tages of any plan which re<]uires hands for tb^ execution of 
it, have recourse to this circumstance in the character of an 




if6S ProposaVjot a Coufi of Lords* I^elegatei, 

article of circumstantial evidence, and that conclusive, esta- 
'blishing, and thai at so small an expense as that of a single 
word, not only the ineligibility but the corruptness of the 
Viieasure : — but it will not pass in any such character with 
any man, who, being duly aware thai, in all its branches, 
government consists but in a choice of evils— evils produced 
that in each instance greater good niay come — holds him- 
self, on the occasion m question, not incompetent to the' 
task of Weighing the good against the evil, and determining 
on which side the balance is to be found. 

Supposing the plan in question received as above in a?l 
, its projected parts, the Court of Lords* Delegates would, 

without the name, add to its other characters that of a 

schoolj and that not only of judicature but of legislation : 

' a school in which such of our noble youth, (supposing anV 

<* , such to be found,) to whom the st tidy might not any more 

> than- the practice of that art does at present apf)ear beneath 

their dignity y might find the means of instruction as well 
as exercise : a school in which, not only the exercise^ but 
by means of the exercise the prizes might, instead of re- 
n)aining a monopoly in the hands of those whose interest 
:it is that the body of the law be in all its points in as bad 
a stale as possible, lie open to those also whose interest, in 
the shape of reputation and conscience, would on this occa- 
sion act in alliance with their duty , and whose interest would 
•not,, at any rate, be in any shape at variance with it. , 

Lastly, being occupied in preparing with all expeditiott 
for the press a work on ParUdmerttary Reform^ in which; 
if my own conception of the matter be correct, the neces- 
sity of such a measure is placed beyond the reach of doubt, 
followed by a plan for that purpose, accompanied in each 
article with reasons and answers to objections, (a plan in 
the contrivance of which 1 saw but little reason to go in 
quest of novelty) it seemed to me of use, .that it should be 
understood, and that most clearly, that to engage a man's 
opinions and affections in favour of such a measure no other 
propensity is necessary than a desire — ^not to pull down but 
to upholdf — not to wrest power out of the hands of present 
possessors, but to render them somewhat less generally and 
flagrantly inept than at present for, as well as disdainful of, 
the exercise of it : that so, when among those questions 
which sooner or later will inevitably be urged, this also 
should be put — ^viz. what are the occupiers of that room 
. with the giU chair in it good for, unless it be to serve as 



Proposal for a Court of Lords Delegates. 269 

tools in the hands of the general^ who now and 

then comes in form and sits in it — a set of implements 
constituting^, when put together, a clumsy piece of ma- 
chinery for producing the eflect of a simple negative — those 
to whom any such searching question happens to be ad- 
dressed, may have some better answer at hand than what 
has been furnished by the threadbare and transparent falla- 
cies that have hitherto been seen to be employed upon that 
service. 

The Hospital of Incurables was a name invented for that 
great room — not by any such plebeian as myself, but by a 
noble practitioner (the Earl of Chesterfield) to whose pene- 
trating eye the condition of all the wards, with all the pa- 
tients in it, had by long observation and experience been 
rendered so familiar. By him, as the name thus bestowed 
bears witness, the condition of the inhabitants was regarded 
as already desperate. For my own part, whether it be that 
being more given to hope, and less to satire, as well as 
somewhat more accustomed to look out for expedieniH, than 
that veteran courtier, my judgment has been led astray by 
my affections, my views of the case are less desponding. 
As hospitals are cpt to be, and as this in particular wuh onco 
pronounced to be* — pronounced so by the inhal)itant8 
themselves when not half so numerous as at present — it 
appears to me, as it has done to others, too niucn crowded f 
in which case it is the less to be wondered at, if, of a species 
of vital gas known in the old nomenclature by the name of 
public spirit, a morbific deficiency should be found : — a 
deficiency, of which the principal efiects and symptoms are 
an habitual lethargy and prostration of istrength, admitting 
of no abatement but what may happen to be produced by 
the accidental pricking of some sucn stimulus as that of a 
canine appetite for fat sinecures. For the over population the 
remedy is too simple, as well as by those whom it concerns 
most nearly too well approvedf, to need any further mention 
in this place. As to the public spirit, the apparatus for the 
injecting of it has been already indicated.
